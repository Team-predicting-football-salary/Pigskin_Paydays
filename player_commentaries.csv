0,Blake Bortles,"[""How have the Jaguars fared in London? Exploring Jacksonville's performances on the international stage  The JacksonvilleJaguars will be back in London again in the 2023 season, this time for two games.  They will meet the Atlanta Falcons in Week 4 and the Buffalo Bills the following week at Tottenham Hotspur stadium. Jags owner Shad Khan is the reason why the franchise makes so many trips to Europe. Khan also owns Premier League team Fulham which is situated in the capital.        So, how have Jacksonville fared across the pond?           A mixed bag for the Jacksonville Jaguars in the UK It all started in 2013 at Wembley, as the Jags hosted the NFC champions from the previous year. It did not end well for Jacksonville as they were embarrassed losing 42-10 to the San Francisco 49ers. They were 28-3 down at halftime, as Colin Kaepernick went 10/16 for 164 yards and a TD. The Jags were cooked on the ground giving up 221 rushing yards, a third one of which was Kaepernick. Chad Henne's 46.7 QBR rating was not enough for the Jags. 0-1 in London. Yet another bad outing for the Jags in 2014 at Wembley. They were beaten 31-17 by the Dallas Cowboys. The Jags found themselves down 24-7 at the half and could only muster up consolation points. Tony Romo had an elite game, going 20/27, for 245 yards and 3TDs. This game was never close, as the Blake Bortles era began in Duval. 0-2 in London     Finally, it happened. The Jags fans from across the world could go home happy with a 34-31 win in 2015. E.J. Manuel and the Buffalo Bills were not the toughest opponent as Bortles slightly outplayed him to guide the Jags to a late win. Young receiver Allen Robinson had a big day with 6 catches for 98 yards and one TD. 1-2 in London. The Jags would for the first time play a divisional game in London, and they would be victorious. Blake Bortles' 19/33 pass attempts for 207 yards and 2TDs was enough to outduel Andrew Luck and the Indianapolis Colts. The Jags gave up 21 points in the fourth quarter to make things nervy, but they survived the scare in the end. 2-2 in London. Hard to believe but the Jaguars had now managed three straight wins overseas. This was by far the most comfortable so far. They had scored 23 at the half and continued their hot hand, getting 21 points in the second half. Joe Flacco would be benched at one point as the Baltimore Ravens surrendered. Blake Bortles had one of the best games of his life finishing with 244 yards and 4TDS. 3-2 in London.     All good things must come to an end and so the win streak in London was no more. Carson Wentz was too much for the Jaguars defense. The Eagles ran the ball 28 times for 133 yards at 4.8 yards per carry. A record crowd at Wembley to date for the NFL international series sent Jaguars fans home unhappy. 3-3 in London. Jacksonville could not stop running back Carlos Hyde in their second divisional outing in London, which came in 2019. Hyde had 160 yards on 19 carries. Gardiner Minshew was never able to get going as he threw 47 passes with only three points to show. To add more misery, Minshew was sacked four times in the 26-3 loss to the Houston Texans. 3-4 In London. No one could have foreseen what was going to happen to the world in 2020, obviously, covid prevented the Jags from making the trip to London. They would return in October 2021 and go home happy.     Trevor Lawrence won his first game abroad in his rookie season. It wasn't such an easy day for Miami Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa. This was the first time an NFL game had been at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium. 4-4 in London. And now to the most recent Jaguars trip to London. You had to have a serious off day to lose to the 2022 Denver Broncos, but that's what happened at Wembley. Russell Wilson had his average 2022 game throwing a TD and a pick, but Lawrence was bad that afternoon with a 10 QBR. Travis Etienne's 156 yards on the ground were not enough for the Jaguars. 4-5 in London.     "", ""Best Quarterback Rooms in NFL - 2018 Edition  The quarterback position is arguably the most important position in the NFL, while the backup quarterback position is the second most important position. The spot has not been in a better situation than 2018 in a long time. The quarterback climate has a perfect mix of veterans and new blood.  The ranking for the quarterback room has taken into account the starter, backup quarterback, scout team QB, supporting cast, offensive system and teams' expected run-to-pass ratio along with past performance and history of injury.        The article ranks the teams by scoring each quarterback and taking the cumulative score as a marker. The third quarterback is only taken into account if they are a viable trade bait or hold any chance to start during the regular season.           #32 Jacksonville Jaguars Starter - Blake Bortles, Backup - Cody Kessler Blake Bortles will try to not let his defense down It is one of the very few quarterback-proof rosters in the NFL. The team will look to lean on the run game in the offense this season. Blake Bortles has to improve his mechanics to move out the bottom of the list and Kessler will need to shake off his winless season with the Browns.     #31 Carolina Panthers Starter - Cam Newton, Backup - Taylor Heinicke Newton will have to become the Superman from 2015 Cam has to be the Superman again under new ownership. Panthers have Taylor Heinicke as their backup. If you are thinking who that person is, you are not alone. #30 Kansas City Chiefs Starter - Pat Mahomes, Backup - Chad Henne Mahomes will have to be the present and future of the squad     Pat Mahomes has not started a relevant game in the NFL. He has potential but Texas Tech's air raid offense is not the best to go by. Chad Henne couldn't beat out Blake Bortles at his worst, which is not the best news for Chiefs faithful. #29 Miami Dolphins Starter - Ryan Tannehill, Backup - Brock Osweiler Tannehill will be playing for his job Brock Osweiler can't be described as the best backup policy for Tannehill, who is coming back from a knee injury last season. The coaching staff is in the hot seat and sharing the division with Patriots does not help.     #28 Washington Redskins Starter - Alex Smith, Backup - Colt McCoy Alex Smith will have to bring his MVP season from Kansas City Alex Smith might live up to his MVPesque season from last time but McCoy would live on as a below average backup QB forever. Alex Smith ain't the worst option after Kirk Cousins left. #27 Houston Texans Starter - Deshaun Watson. Backup - Brandon Weeden Deshaun Watson will have to be the player he was before the injury     Houston has Weeden as their backup to their sophomore superstar coming off an ACL injury, O'Brien would hope for a better option than that. The team hopes to stay fit next season and do some damage in AFC. #26 Dallas Cowboys Starter - Dak Prescott, Backup - Mike White, Cooper Rush Prescott will get his sidekick in Ezekial Elliott back for the season Dak and Zeke form a formidable offense but the Cowboys quarterback room could do better than Mike White and Rush. Jason Garrett must be hoping for Kellen Moore (probably not).     #25 Cincinnati Bengals Starter - Andy Dalton, Backup - Matt Barkley Dalton will have to bemoreconsistent upcoming season Cincinnati Bengals have changes looming in front of them, the coaching staff is in the hot seat and the QB room ain't helping. Andy Dalton has been used to define the term 'average' all over the NFL dictionary and Barkley never lived up to his high school potential. #24 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Starter - Winston, Backup - Ryan Fitzpatrick Tampa Bay will not have Winston for the first 3 weeks per suspension     Winston will serve his ban and Ryan Fitzpatrick will be QB-1 in the depth chart, sounds depressing, probably is. #23 Baltimore Ravens Starter/ Backup - Joe Flacco, Lamar Jackson. The QB competition is in full swing at Ravens camp Ravens' coaching has been immensely impressed with rookie Lamar Jackson. The reports from preseason indicate that Joe Flacco has been showing more initiation as well. Ravens will be looking to capitalize on a soft AFC. #22 Chicago Bears Starter - Mitchell Trubisky, Backup - Chase Daniels Trubisky can lead Bears to playoffs and become the greatest franchise QB     Bears have a new offensive system and Chase Daniel as the backup, who has come from the Chiefs system that Matt Nagy will be running. Trubisky needs to live up to his draft pedigree and Bears can easily jump to the next tier. #21 Buffalo Bills Starter - AJ McCarron, Backup - Josh Allen, Nathan Peterman The team will hope for Josh Allen to win the starting job Bills brought in McCarron from Bengals as an insurance policy to their Rookie, Josh Allen. Bills have an average starter, one raw rookie, and a backup with starting capabilities in Peterman. No one should be surprised if everyone gets a start in Buffalo.     #20 Denver Broncos Starter - Case Keenum, Backup - Paxton Lynch, Chad Kelly Keenum will hop to fill the big shoes of Peyton Manning Case Keenum had a career year last season but he won't have the similar support cast as Minnesota. Paxton Lynch has bust written all over him and won't even command a conditional pick in return. #19 Tennessee Titans Starter - Marcus Mariota, Backup - Blaine Gabbert Mariota needs to bounce back from a dreadful last season     Titans have been a run first team but Mariota needs to improve his play for them to compete against Houston in the division. Gabbert can be a great backup in the correct system with his cannon arm and great mobility. #18 New York Giants Starter - Eli Manning, Backup - Davis Webb/ Kyle Lauletta Eli Manning will have to deliver with the run game to support Eli Manning has lost way too many steps to be a top tier QB but his stellar offensive sidekicks should take him to the belief land. Davis Webb has been making a lot of noise this offseason along with Kyle Lauletta at the backup position.     #17 Oakland Raiders Starter - Derek Carr, Backup - Connor Cooks Derek Carr will have to gel into Gruden's offense sooner than later Derek Carr underachieved last season. Cook and Carr will soon realize that life under Gruden is not as rosy as Gruden Camp. The team has Jeff Fisher vibes of finishing 8-8. #16 Detroit Lions Starter - Matthew Stafford, Backup - Matt Cassel Stafford can rise up to the next level     Stafford has one of the best arm seen in the sport but he needs a better support cast. How does Matt Cassel still have a job in NFL, even though it is as a backup? #15 Atlanta Falcons Starter - Matt Ryan, Backup - Matt Schaub Matt Ryan can bring the Falcons to the top Matt Ryan has had a legendary career till now, without winning the big one. The bad news is that they have Matt Schaub as the backup. #14 New Orleans Saints Starter - Drew Brees, Backup - Tom Savage     Drew Brees will look to take Saints further than last time Saints are moving on to a more run-heavy offense which might help the longevity of Brees. Saints are one of the big boys of NFC and Brees would love to make one last run before father time gets him. Tom Savage is not what you dream of as a backup but Saints don't have an option. Hill is the scout team QB who is turning heads at camp. #13 Seattle Seahawks Starter - Russell Wilson, Backup - Austin Davis     Russell Wilson will look for some help from the run offense Russell Wilson is a one-man offense for Seahawks with zero run game, no O-line help and below par receiving core. Russell Wilson does it all but sadly Austin Davis can't. The diminishing quality of Seahawks defense makes their chances of playoff dim. #12 Los Angeles Rams LA Rams - Starter - Jared Goff, Backup - Sean Mannion Goff will look to improve on his stellar performance last season     Jared Goff took a big leap last season. Sean McVay has been a godsend to Rams offense. Sean Mannion is not the best backup option but he has been in the system and a good subordinate to the young future of Los Angeles. Goff is a sneaky MVP candidate with Gurley by the sides. #11 Pittsburgh Steelers Starter - Roethlisberger, Backup - Mason Rudolph/ Landry Jones Roethlisberger will look to capitalize on Bell's last year in Pittsburgh Steelers have a complete offense led by Big Ben. His two quarterback understudies are raw and with minimal arm talent. Roethlisberger has been injured in bits and pieces over the last few seasons and the weak backup situation doesn't help the Steelers.     #10 Los Angeles Chargers Starter - Rivers, Backup - Geno Smith/ Cardale Jones Rivers will be looking for some luck and support from the fans Rivers is a great starter with a competent backup in Geno Smith. The run game led by Melvin Gordon with the receiving talent of Keenan Allen would be a handful for any defense. If the team stays fit, they can be a challenger for the AFC title. #09 San Francisco 49ers Starter - Jimmy Garoppolo, Backup - CJ Bethard Jimmy G will look to become Jimmy GQ     Garoppolo ended the 49ers season last year with 5 wins. The only way for the 49ers is up. Kyle Shanahan has one of the most sophisticated offenses in the league. CJ Bethard as the backup is a little suspect. Bay area is waiting for Jimmy G to become Jimmy Jesus. #8 Cleveland Browns Starter - Tyrod Taylor, Backup - Baker Mayfield/ Drew Stanton Baker and Tyrod will look to bring back the glory at Cleveland Browns were the worst team in Football but they have added to every position on the pitch. Taylor is a dependable QB, who can give you 5 wins on his worst day. Baker is the future with great football ethics and Drew Stanton will be a great third QB while developing a rookie. Browns look like a sneaky break out team for the upcoming season.     #07 Green Bay Packers Starter - Aaron Rodgers, Backup - DeShone Kizer Rodgers will be without his favorite wide receiver next season Rodgers has been known to hide most of the blemishes of his team. Packers traded for Kizer to be the backup, who was the QB of a 16 loss team. The addition of Jimmy Graham at tight end position will come as a great help after Nelson left. #06 New England Patriots Starter - Tom Brady, Backup - Brian Hoyer/ Danny Etling Brady will look to defy father time for one more season     Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time. Brian Hoyer is definitely not the greatest backup quarterback of all time. Brady's age is a sign of trouble but he is the reigning MVP of the league. Patriots have drafted Danny Etling in the late rounds who could turn up to be a great option for the future. #05 Indianapolis Colts Starter - Andrew Luck, Backup - Jacoby Brissett Luck finally looks set to be back alongside promising backup in Brissett If Andrew Luck wasn't coming back from injury, Colts could have been the top team in this exercise. Brissett has been a great trade by Colts. Luck has started training again and the revamped offensive line won't hurt either. The future looks bright for the franchise.     #04 New York Jets Starter/ Backup - Darnold, Josh McCown, Bridgewater Jets will have one of the most balanced quarterback room No one expected Jets to end up this high on the list but they have a great experienced starter and teacher in Josh McCown. They arguably got the best quarterback from the recent draft in Sam Darnold and they signed Teddy Bridgewater for free in the offseason. Bridgewater is the biggest trade asset in the league and front-runner for the comeback player of the year. Jets have stability at the position for the first time in a long time.     #03 Minnesota Vikings Starter - Kirk Cousins, Backup - Trevor Siemian Cousins will be expected to live up to his price tag The future looks bright for the franchise. Kirk Cousins is underrated even after being the costliest player in football and Siemian is as good a backup as any. Vikings will try to make the run in a loaded NFC. #02 Arizona Cardinals Starter - Sam Bradford, Backup - Josh Rosen/ Mike Glennon Rosen will look to earn the starts while Bradford needs to stay fit     The Cardinals have one of the most polished QB coming out of College in Rosen. Sam Bradford can be a top 15 quarterback when fit. The quarterback room compliments each other, unlike any other team. Cardinals can shock a lot of people next season. #01 Philadelphia Eagles Starter - Carson Wentz, Backup - Nick Foles Eagles would love another Philly special, with Wentz this time Nick Foles just won Philly the Superbowl, while the future MVP of the league (Wentz) was sidelined with an injury. Eagles have things sorted till Foles gets traded for too many draft picks. The Eagles QB room might just help them reach the mountaintop again. The in-depth look into every quarterback room made me realize that Matt Cassel, Matt Schaub, and Landry Jones will keep having backup jobs in 2096 and no one will ever notice. In conclusion. my biggest fear is that Blake Bortles will end up winning the Superbowl and make this article as irrelevant as his throwing motion.

It may have arguably never been on the rails to begin with now that it\'s been given some thought.        Dan Lust 🎙@SportsLawLustJosh Rosen caught a stray in the Amended Complaint filed by Steve Wilks against the Cardinals.He says he urged the GM to trade up to draft Josh Allen in 2018 but instead the team moved up to take Josh Rosen.The complaint calls this “one of the great draft gaffes of all time.”5012Josh Rosen caught a stray in the Amended Complaint filed by Steve Wilks against the Cardinals.He says he urged the GM to trade up to draft Josh Allen in 2018 but instead the team moved up to take Josh Rosen.The complaint calls this “one of the great draft gaffes of all time.” https://t.co/zvYs8hifMs           Rosen had three more interceptions than he did touchdowns and failed to eclipse 250 passing yards in his first four NFL appearances, doing so in just one game the entire season. Some of his QB stats were brutal relative to the competition, per 98.7 FM Arizona\'s Sports Station: ""Rosen ranked 33rd and last among qualified candidates with a quarterback rating of 66.7 this season. That ranked immediately behind rookie Bills QB Josh Allen’s 67.9 and rookie Jets signal-caller Sam Darnold’s 77.6 rating. Rosen was also 33rd by averaging 163 passing yards per game and just 5.80 yards per attempt.""     The leash in Arizona was so short that he was yanked from the position and was on a different NFL roster by year two. Miami took him on as Ryan Fitzpatrick\'s backup, and he couldn\'t play his way out of that role. No team took him on during the pandemic-stricken 2020 season. He was hardly given a chance with the Atlanta Falcons, though his 2/11 passing performance probably had a lot to do with that. Blake Bortles was at the top of the world in 2018 Blake Bortles It\'s somewhat tragic tracking the trajectory of Blake Bortles\' NFL career, thus far. The Florida-born quarterback played college ball at UCF. He was drafted with the 2014 NFL Draft\'s No. 3 pick to be the franchise signal-caller in Jacksonville. His rookie season was disappointing enough to put him on the chopping block. Somehow, he persevered and threw for 35 touchdowns in what was the antithesis of a sophomore slump.

Marcus Mariota 19.9 Things peaked in January 2018 when Bortles\' Jaguars went toe-to-toe with Tom Brady\'s Patriots, but the New England 24-20 win was the closest Bortles would get to being at the top of the NFL totem pole. His offensive line was shaky. His receivers weren\'t putting themselves in position to make plays, and ultimately Bortles himself no longer had the stuff to be the starter for any team, at least, according to the league. Mark Sanchez had a rough season in 2012, got injured, and never returned to a starting role     Mark Sanchez Mark Sanchez can definitely up the tragedy from Blake Bortles\' case. Sanchez came from USC as a top prospect and immediately had the Jets in the AFC Championship his first and second seasons after years of futility from the franchise, with Chad Pennington as the primary option under center. Then, Tim Tebow was brought into the mix. The ""butt fumble"" transpired at MetLife Stadium on Thanksgiving night 2012 just weeks after Hurricane Sandy. Sanchez was injured playing in a preseason game in the summer of 2013, while trying to earn the starting job. Sanchez\'s prospects of being a top option in someone\'s backfield were gone.        Then-Jets coach Rex Ryan spoke of his regret at even having the former first-round NFL Draft pick in the game late during a preseason game. He said that he would have changed things if he could: “That was a tough situation obviously. If I could go back and change things, of course you would. You don’t want anybody to ever get hurt. But again, you’ve got to decide, guys. Somebody has to play.” When it happened, Ryan was far less remorseful. He suggested that Sanchez being on the field was necessary. This would enable the team to decide who the starting QB would be for the 2013 season between Sanchez and Geno Smith: ""We\'re there to win. We had our starting offense out there for three quarters -- we\'re trying to win the game, that\'s what we wanted to do. … We\'re trying to compete. Everybody\'s out there and injuries are part of the game.""     No matter how Sanchez lost his 2013 season, it was clear he was no longer the guy in New York with second-round rookie Smith out to become QB1. He would never start again in his NFL career. Geno Smith was another Jets flameout Geno Smith Unfortunately, speaking of Geno Smith, he was a fellow Jets flameout in 2014. He joined the man he replaced and was neck and neck with during Gang Green\'s 2013 QB competition, Mark Sanchez. He had identical touchdowns to interceptions, but Smith\'s 2014 season hit an embarrassingly low-point in December of that year with the Jets limiting him to eight pass attempts for the first 58 minutes. When New York needed him to successfully run the two-minute drill, he threw an interception with 34 seconds left to close the door on a 16-13 loss.     Smith is, somehow, in the running for Seattle\'s starting job here in 2022, with the Seahawks competition coming down to the 31-year-old and one of the pieces in the Russell Wilson trade, Drew Lock. By no means is he a clear-cut NFL starter, and he hasn\'t been one in eight years. Colin Kaepernick is no longer be a starter for many reasons Colin Kaepernick This inclusion may be controversial, but Colin Kaepernick did not engineer a winning effort in San Francisco during his final seasons in the Bay in 2015 and 2016.        The 49ers made a business decision that had on-field ramifications during the winter of 2017 in cutting him. Jimmy Garoppolo, future Super Bowl QB, entered the room with long-time utility option C. J. Beathard.The fact that few teams have looked at him since then is probably primarily due to off-field distractions, but Kaepernick was never NFL starter material after showing the inability to hit his targets during a difficult 2016 campaign.     ', ""NFL Training Camp 2021: 5 Green Bay Packers players on the roster bubble\xa0  Reigning NFC North champions Green Bay Packers have high hopes entering the 2021 NFL season. They've made back-to-back NFC Championship games over the past two seasons and will be looking at another Super Bowl appearance in 2022.  Spots on the Packers roster will be hotly contested during this year’s training camp with some of last season’s contributors likely to miss out.                   Packers players who need big training camp performances           View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Green Bay Packers (@packers)  #1 - Josh Jackson The 25-year-old cornerback has not lived up to his potential since he was drafted 45th overall by the Green Bay Packers in the 2018 NFL Draft. He recorded just 21 tackles last season, doing so in limited game time. Green Bay drafted another cornerback, Eric Stokes, in the first round of this year’s draft, which means Jackson’s time in Green Bay may be nearly up. The Packers could look for a late-round draft pick for the young cornerback.      #2 - Malik Taylor Wide receiver Malik Taylor needs a big training camp to solidify his spot on the Packers active roster. The six-foot-one, 220-pound Taylor has yet to make his mark at Lambeau Field, starting just one game last season. The 25-year-old backup wideout had only five receptions for 66 yards in 2020 in limited game time. The arrival of rookie slot receiver Amari Rodgers puts even more pressure on Taylor to stand out at training camp.  #3 - Jace Sternberger Backup tight end Jace Sternberger could be on his way out of Lambeau Field this year. On June 10, he was suspended for two games after violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy. The suspension, added to a lack of production when he was given the opportunity, sees him on the Packers roster bubble. Over his two seasons with Green Bay, he has played in 13 games with 114 yards receiving and one touchdown.  #4 - Dexter Williams     Running back Dexter Williams has seen very little game time since being drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the sixth round of the 2019 NFL Draft. He only carried the ball twice last season for the Packers for eight total yards. Green Bay drafted another running back, Kylin Hill, this year and Williams will be under immense pressure to hold onto his active roster spot.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Green Bay Packers (@packers)  #5 - Blake Bortles If star quarterback Aaron Rodgers decides to end his holdout and return to Lambeau for this year’s training camp, Blake Bortles could be cut or traded. The veteran NFL quarterback was signed by the Packers this off-season before mini-camp.     Green Bay has also signed backup quarterback Kurt Benkert, and it seems unlikely that Blake Bortles will be needed if Rodgers returns. The Packers could look to trade the 29-year-old QB to a team like the New York Jets, who are short of a veteran play-caller.The former Jacksonville Jaguars starting QB led the franchise to the NFL playoffs in 2017.     "", ""Dallas Cowboys training camp round-up: Cowboys realize squad depth conundrum after injury scare  The Dallas Cowboys entered 2021 NFL training camp with high hopes, with the return of the franchise quarterback, a stellar wide receiving core and a promising rookie linebacker who could be the face of the defense.  But just days into training camp practice, the Cowboys have had some injury scares that have made them think twice about the depth chart.        Dallas Cowboys training camp roundup: Depth chart necessities           The Dallas Cowboys were delighted with the recovery and return of starting quarterback Dak Prescott from a serious ankle injury. Just days into 2021 training camp, the franchise quarterback suffered a shoulder injury that will keep him out of action for a short period of time. With that, the Cowboys were dealt with a lingering question from last season as to who the best backup quarterback option is. Cowboys RB Ezekiel Elliott on Dak Prescott shoulder injury: “I know it sucks for him having to be sidelined again.” But relieved it’s just a strain. pic.twitter.com/2Bxl9X46pc— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) July 29, 2021     Although it turned out that Prescott's injury is just a fatigue-related issue, it did cause some panic as to what the team would do if he were out for a significant period of time again. The Cowboys turned to Garrett Gilbert to work with first-team reps, but his performance seemed to concern the Cowboys coaching staff. Now, it seems the team is looking for a veteran free agent quarterback, someone who can be relied upon, if need be. One option could be Blake Bortles, who was recently released by the Green Bay Packers after Aaron Rodgers officially returned to the team. While wide receiver is in another position with some injuries, the Cowboys seem to have plenty of depth to cover until the return of Amari Cooper and Michael Gallup. The offensive line position does have some depth issues. Tyron Smith and La'el Collins look to be locked in, but Ty Nsekhe and Terence Steele haven't impressed at offensive tackle.     COWBOYS TRAINING CAMP 🎬: WR CeeDee Lamb goes airborne! ✭ #dallascowboys pic.twitter.com/9UwaMqLoJ9— The Cowboys Network (@TheCowboysNet) July 28, 2021 On the interior offensive line, Zack Martin hasn't been a participant in practice, which isn't a concern at the moment. Luckily, Connor Williams is versatile and Connor McGovern is slowly making improvements as well, but the Cowboys may still want to add some depth to the offensive line to ensure squad depth in case of unforeseen circumstances.With the addition of Malik Hooker, the Dallas Cowboys defense seems to be off to a good start with new defensive coordinator Dan Quinn. There is some depth on defense, which should prove valuable down the stretch.     "", ""Predicting the top three candidates for NFL Comeback Player of the Year in 2022  The NFL can be a very unforgiving environment at times. Players are always just one bad tackle or landing from retirement. The careers of some of the greatest prospects can be derailed, with the player returning to the NFL diminished. The majority of players suffer at least one gruesome injury during their careers, but they always try their best to return to the league.  The NFL Comeback Player of the Year award is awarded to players who missed significant time in a campaign, only to return in earnest. The award is about overcoming adversity and is not always about returning from injury. Sometimes a player is benched and has to break out and prove himself.        Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals won the award for the 2021 NFL season. The Bengals quarterback tore his ACL in a tackle in his rookie year during the 2020 campaign. There were concerns he would be the same player upon his return. These concerns proved unfounded. Burrow threw for 4,611 yards and 34 touchdowns in the 2021 NFL season. His performances led the Bengals to the Super Bowl, where they fell to the Los Angeles Rams.           Here are my top three candidates to take home Comeback Player of the Year honors in the upcoming season: #1. Christian McCaffrey, Carolina Panthers Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey     Call me an eternal optimist, but I will or have drafted Christian McCaffrey anywhere from the second pick of my NFL fantasy drafts onwards. Mainly because he has been a historically great statistical performer and a really fun player to watch when healthy. McCaffrey has been limited to just ten games over the last two years by shoulder, thigh, hamstring and ankle injuries. This is obviously assuming that he can finally stay healthy in 2022. The Riot Report@RRiotReportYou can't ever get tired of watching Christian McCaffrey highlights.The dual-threat RB turns 26 today and #Panthers fans can't wait to see him back on the field.:@NFL41756You can't ever get tired of watching Christian McCaffrey highlights.The dual-threat RB turns 26 today and #Panthers fans can't wait to see him back on the field.🎥:@NFLhttps://t.co/uGKbVIaZJv Looking at the pieces around him, unless you count like the last one-and-a-half years of banged-up Cam Newton, Baker Mayfield may be the best quarterback McCaffrey has played with. You may not be a fan of Ben McAdoo as a head coach, but looking at how the New York Giants have fallen apart since his departure and considering how quick-paced his offenses are, the scheme could create more space for the back. Especially with a talented group of receivers around him.     Most importantly, I don’t believe people acknowledge how much better the Carolina Panthers O-line could be. I expect them to improve at three spots, with sixth overall pick Ikem Ekwonu and a couple of solid veterans. When he last played a full season (2019), McCaffrey led the league with 2,400 scrimmage yards and 19 TDs. #2. Allen Robinson, Los Angeles Rams Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Allen Robinson A different comeback story may be written for Allen Robinson in the City of Angels. This guy has basically been in quarterback purgatory ever since he came to Penn State. Blake Bortles probably remains the best guy he’s caught passes from ever since then, before kind of shutting it down since December last year. Robinson was still able to produce despite that.     Bleacher Nation Bears@BN_BearsMy gift to you on Allen Robinson’s birthday: 2 minutes of highlights featuring some of the best hands in football. 🥳   1899My gift to you on Allen Robinson’s birthday: 2 minutes of highlights featuring some of the best hands in football. 🥳 🎁 🎉 https://t.co/Hg0V3GXukw If you take out his first and most recent year in the pros respectively (along with 2017, when he was lost for the year after just one catch), he has averaged 1,087 yards and 7.4 touchdowns per season. Whether he was used on the perimeter as a vertical, ball-winning receiver or running option routes from the slot, Robinson can and has done pretty much everything. He now gets to play under Sean McVay and the Los Angeles Rams. In the upcoming NFL campaign, he has Matthew Stafford throwing him the ball. Stafford has only failed to go over 4,000 passing yards once since 2011 (when he was limited to just eight games). Looking at how they used Odell Beckham Jr. as their X receiver last season, particularly as a designated red-zone target near the goal-line, but also to some degree Robert Woods, I could easily see him go for 1,200 yards and double-digit touchdowns.

He headlined my list last season and barely made an impact at all, due to constantly being banged up yet again. So once more, I’m working under the assumption that he won’t land badly, twisting his ankle or knee, which has caused him to miss more games than he's played across the past two seasons.     I believe because he has tried to tough it out and hasn’t looked like himself, people think he’s washed. I refuse to not look at him as an elite draft prospect and talent in the running back position. His combination of burst, lower body strength, natural receiving skills and his break-away speed made him the NFL’s leader in scrimmage yards as a rookie back in 2018.

Considering Big Blue now have two tackles from top-ten picks and added a couple of above-average starting veterans on the interior, that unit has seen an immense upgrade.     Then you have Brian Daboll and Mike Kafka opening up what has been a very underwhelming offensive structure. Combine this with the more dynamic receiving talent around him and Saquon Barkley will remind people of the player he is in this NFL season.If you enjoyed this breakdown, please make sure to check out the original piece, where I also predict all the other awards and the playoff picture, leading up to Super Bowl LVII.     "", ""Ranking Tom Brady's 10 greatest games in the NFL playoffs  Name a better pairing than Tom Brady and the NFL playoffs. Brady-Bill Belichick perhaps comes closest, but you get the point.  Tom Brady is the definition of a perennial contender. Over the years, the league's most garlanded QB has put together some truly special performances in the NFL playoffs. Here are ten of the heroic quarterback's most iconic performances in the NFL playoffs.        Tom Brady's greatest playoff outings            #1 - Super Bowl 51 versus the Atlanta Falcons (2016) This was one of the best late-game performances by any player in the history of the sport. Early on, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots came out flat and fell behind Matt Ryan and Kyle Shanahan's passing attack. Near the end of the third quarter, the scoreboard read 28-3. It seemed the New England Patriots were going to lose the Super Bowl. That's when Atlanta hit a wall and Tom Brady started to heat up. Within the final quarter and change, Brady made up a 25-point deficit and forced the game into overtime. By this point, the Atlanta Falcons never had a chance. It was the largest comeback in Super Bowl history. Most New England Patriots fans would rank this as the best game they have ever seen. This might have been Tom Brady's greatest moment as an NFL quarterback.     #2 - 2018 AFC Championship against the Kansas City Chiefs (2018) This was Patrick Mahomes' breakout season, which made Brady's showing all the more audacious. Mahomes spent the length of the regular season lighting up the league, throwing for 50 touchdowns. It seemed that the Chiefs were a shoe-in for the Super Bowl. However, they needed to get past Tom Brady first. what a time. ⏰ #Madden22 pic.twitter.com/BpupuKB4e3— Patrick Mahomes II (@PatrickMahomes) June 17, 2021 The Kansas City Chiefs had already played the New England Patriots earlier in the year. Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady went back and forth en route to a 40-43 loss for Kansas. With the game running so close, it appeared Patrick Mahomes was too good to lose a similar game twice.     However, Tom Brady's Patriots put up 37 in the AFC Championship game to send the young gun home. The game ended up going into overtime due to a late score by Brady with only about a minute left to play. #3 - AFC Championship versus Jacksonville Jaguars (2017) The Jacksonville Jaguars were balling in 2017. Leonard Fournette had a breakout rookie year, earning over 1,000 rushing yards and nine touchdowns. Their defense was ranked second overall. Going into this meeting, though, Tom Brady was the favorite. Tom Brady     However, the legendary quarterback came out flat. Late in the game, it seemed that the New England Patriots were going to go home. Brady chose this moment to put up one of the most clutch fourth-quarters of his career. At the end of the game, the New England Patriots came out on top and Blake Bortles was sent home. #4 - AFC Championship versus the Denver Broncos (2015) The Denver Broncos had one of the best defenses of all time in 2015. The team featured Von Miller, DeMarcus Ware, Aqib Talib, Chris Harris Jr., TJ Ward, and others. The defense was nigh unbeatable. While Tom Brady ultimately lost the game, he still got within one throw of forcing overtime. Down 20-12, Tom Brady had one drive to tie the game. He scored a touchdown but could not convert on the two-point attempt. Had kicker Stephen Gostkowski not missed a kick earlier in the game, the Patriots would have been able to tie it with an extra point. Instead, they were forced to go for two at the end of a late scoring drive.         What was impressive about this was just how good the Denver Broncos defense was. Every other team failed to accomplish what Tom Brady did that season. #5 - Super Bowl 52 versus Philadelphia Eagles (2017) The Philadelphia Eagles were on fire during the 2017 regular season. But when Carson Wentz went down with an injury, few had the Philadelphia Eagles as contenders for the Super Bowl. That is, everyone except for the Philadelphia Eagles. They coasted to a top seed and used their home-field advantage to deliver knockout blows to the Atlanta Falcons and the Minnesota Vikings.     People continued to doubt the Philadelphia Eagles up to the last second of the Super Bowl. That was the momentum the Eagles carried into the meeting with Tom Brady's Patriots. Nick Foles played the best game of his life, forcing Tom Brady to reciprocate. While Tom Brady ultimately lost the game, it was not because of a lack of trying. Brady threw for over 500 yards and three touchdowns, blowing up the stat sheet. The offensive performance was something unheard of in the Super Bowl, especially in a losing effort. Tom Brady     The game came down to a Hail Mary thrown by Tom Brady that was almost caught for a go-ahead touchdown.  #6 - Super Bowl 38 versus Philadelphia Eagles Tom Brady won his third Super Bowl in this game. He finished the day with 236 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions, according to Pro Football Reference. The Patriots won the game 24-21. #7 - Super Bowl 36 versus St. Louis Rams The game resulted in Tom Brady's first Super Bowl victory. He threw for 145 yards and one touchdown. While the stats aren't very Brady-like, it was his first Super Bowl. #8 - Super Bowl 49 versus Seattle Seahawks Tom Brady set up the New England Patriots to win this game. He had a 74 percent completion percentage and threw for four touchdowns. Everyone remembers this game for the interception at the goal line by Malcolm Butler which meant Tom Brady's heroic effort went a tad unnoticed. #9 - Super Bowl 53 versus Los Angeles Rams     Wade Phillips had Tom Brady's number in this game. Even so, he was able to find Rob Gronkowski to set up the only touchdown of the game. His ability to overcome Wade Phillips overshadowed his stats on the night. He had 262 yards and an interception. #10 - Super Bowl 55 versus Kansas City ChiefsWhile Tom Brady did not have too much to do in this game, he did become the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, and only the second quarterback to do it with two teams. He completed 72 percent of his passes and threw for 201 yards and three touchdowns en route to a 31-9 win.     "", ""Ranking Patrick Mahomes' 3 worst games of his career  Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is of course one of the best players in the NFL. He has won a Super Bowl, an MVP award, and has been named to the Pro Bowl every year he’s started in the league. He’s also got one of the best records in the league, winning 50 games in just 63 starts.  He has a resumé to match anyone’s and he’s thrown 151 touchdowns and 18,991 yards in just four years as a starter. In 2018 he won his MVP award and threw 50 touchdowns, a feat only matched by legends Tom Brady and Peyton Manning.        Bleacher Report@BleacherReport50. Yes FIFTY. 23-year-old Patrick Mahomes just threw his 50th touchdown this season.18539353650. Yes FIFTY. 23-year-old Patrick Mahomes just threw his 50th touchdown this season. https://t.co/Vr6iIdiz07           However, he hasn’t always had it his own way. Even though he plays well most Sundays, there have been times he’s had a horror show. Here are Patrick Mahomes' three worst NFL games: #3 - vs Jacksonville Jaguars, 2018 Jacksonville Jaguars v Kansas City Chiefs     Mahomes didn't have his best game during his first year as a starter when the Chiefs faced the Jacksonville Jaguars. Despite Kansas City winning 30-14, the Texas Tech product only completed 22 of 38 passes. While he did manage to pass for 313 yards, he didn’t pass for a touchdown, instead throwing two interceptions. He ended the day with a passer rating of just 62.7, and was only marginally better than the quarterback on the opposing bench that day, Blake Bortles. Mahomes will admit that he was lucky the Chiefs’ defence were on form that day, clocking up five sacks and two interceptions. #2 - vs Denver Broncos, 2021 Denver Broncos v Kansas City Chiefs     One of the worst games of his career came last season, when the Chiefs faced their division rival, the Denver Broncos. The Chiefs won 22-9, but their quarterback only passed for 184 yards, completing just 15 out of 29 passes. His completion percentage was just 51.7%, and to top it off, he only mustered up a passer rating of 57.3, the lowest of his career, according to statmuse.com.  He did run a touchdown in, but it was a rarity to see Mahomes end the day without a passing touchdown, a feat that has only occurred six times in his career thus far. #1 - vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 2020 Super Bowl LV - Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs Kansas City Chiefs     The one game that springs to mind when it comes to Patrick Mahomes’ worst career game is Super Bowl LV. In this game, the Chiefs were taken down 31-9 by Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Mahomes was under duress throughout the game, as he only managed 270 passing yards, zero touchdowns and two interceptions. He was sacked three times and found Buccaneers defenders all over him on every play. The Chiefs’ offensive line crumbled in the big game and the quarterback was running for his life. His passer rating was just 52.3 as he completed just 26 of his 49 passes as Kansas City fell apart in Miami.Doug Kyed@DougKyedSuper Bowl LV passer ratings:Tom Brady: 140.1Patrick Mahomes: 37.43105399Super Bowl LV passer ratings:Tom Brady: 140.1Patrick Mahomes: 37.4😬     "", ""When was Aaron Donald drafted?  Los Angeles Rams' legend Aaron Donald was drafted in 2014 by the then-St. Louis Rams. Donald was selected as the 13th pick in the first round of the 2014 Draft out of Pittsburgh University.  The Rams drafted Donald due to his elite performances at the college level, his versatility on defense, and his freakishly strong frame. The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania native was expected to be selected in the lottery of the 2014 Draft, but he ended up slipping to the midway point of the draft.

Aaron Donald has had a Hall of Fame-worthy NFL career, and the crazy part is that he hasn't even played up to ten seasons yet. Donald has racked up many accolades in his nine years, including three NFL Defensive Player of the Year Awards, seven first-team All-Pro selections, nine Pro Bowl selections, and a Super Bowl win (LVI). He has been a pivotal part of the Rams' defense from the moment he stepped into the locker room to this very moment.     Aaron Donald is the primary reason the Los Angeles Rams came out victorious in Super Bowl LVI, as he kept the Cincinnati Bengals offense at bay. Donald has put up an impressive stat line of 489 tackles, 103 sacks, and 24 forced fumbles in 138 games.

Goff suffered the injury in L.A.'s loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday.  This is a huge blow to the Rams and their playoff hopes. The Rams will head into Week 17 with a lot on the line against the Arizona Cardinals, and they won't have their franchise quarterback.        The Rams will turn to backup QB John Wolford to be the starter against the Cardinals. This will be the biggest game of Wolford's career. It will also be the first start of his NFL career.           How will Jared Goff's absence impact the Los Angeles Rams in Week 17 and the NFL Playoffs?  What could happen to the Rams in Week 17 Los Angeles Rams need to win against the Arizona Cardinals or have the Chicago Bears lose to the Green Bay Packers to secure a 2020 NFL Playoff spot.  This may be tough without starting quarterback Jared Goff but they will most likely be a No. 6 or No. 7 seed in the NFC. Head coach Sean McVay has said that the Los Angeles Rams are going to try and sign Blake Bortles to back up John Wolford in case things go wrong. Rams’ QB Jared Goff underwent surgery today on his broken right thumb in LA and is unlikely to play Sunday vs. Arizona, sources tell ESPN. If he can’t play Sunday, Goff could return for the playoffs if Rams advance there.John Wolford is Goff’s backup and now in line to start.— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 29, 2020     The Rams have one of the best defenses in the NFL and will need them in Week 17. Arizona Cardinals were dominated by the Los Angeles Rams defense in their last meeting. Worst case scenario for the Los Angeles Rams is if they lose to Arizona and Chicago wins against Green Bay. If this were to happen the Los Angeles Rams would miss the 2020 NFL Playoffs. This would be one of the biggest collapses in recent years in the NFL if the Rams were to miss the playoffs. They were 9-4 sitting at the top of the NFC West and lost two straight games. One of those games being against the 0-13 New York Jets.  Will Jared Goff return for the NFL Playoffs? Los Angeles Rams and Head Coach Sean McVay are optimistic that Jared Goff will be available for the 2020 NFL Playoffs. During the 20-9 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 16, Jared Goff would pop his dislocated thumb back into place. After the game it was confirmed that the thumb was broken.     #InjuryReport 🚨- Cool video alert!

It would be an amazing comeback if we see Jared Goff start the Wild Card game for the Los Angeles Rams. Sean McVay feels confident in back up quarterback John Wolford even though he has never started in an NFL game.If the Los Angeles Rams want to make a run in the 2020 NFL Playoffs they will need Jared Goff to be their starting quarterback.

1,Cody Kessler,"[""Best Quarterback Rooms in NFL - 2018 Edition  The quarterback position is arguably the most important position in the NFL, while the backup quarterback position is the second most important position. The spot has not been in a better situation than 2018 in a long time. The quarterback climate has a perfect mix of veterans and new blood.  The ranking for the quarterback room has taken into account the starter, backup quarterback, scout team QB, supporting cast, offensive system and teams' expected run-to-pass ratio along with past performance and history of injury.        The article ranks the teams by scoring each quarterback and taking the cumulative score as a marker. The third quarterback is only taken into account if they are a viable trade bait or hold any chance to start during the regular season.           #32 Jacksonville Jaguars Starter - Blake Bortles, Backup - Cody Kessler Blake Bortles will try to not let his defense down It is one of the very few quarterback-proof rosters in the NFL. The team will look to lean on the run game in the offense this season. Blake Bortles has to improve his mechanics to move out the bottom of the list and Kessler will need to shake off his winless season with the Browns.     #31 Carolina Panthers Starter - Cam Newton, Backup - Taylor Heinicke Newton will have to become the Superman from 2015 Cam has to be the Superman again under new ownership. Panthers have Taylor Heinicke as their backup. If you are thinking who that person is, you are not alone. #30 Kansas City Chiefs Starter - Pat Mahomes, Backup - Chad Henne Mahomes will have to be the present and future of the squad     Pat Mahomes has not started a relevant game in the NFL. He has potential but Texas Tech's air raid offense is not the best to go by. Chad Henne couldn't beat out Blake Bortles at his worst, which is not the best news for Chiefs faithful. #29 Miami Dolphins Starter - Ryan Tannehill, Backup - Brock Osweiler Tannehill will be playing for his job Brock Osweiler can't be described as the best backup policy for Tannehill, who is coming back from a knee injury last season. The coaching staff is in the hot seat and sharing the division with Patriots does not help.     #28 Washington Redskins Starter - Alex Smith, Backup - Colt McCoy Alex Smith will have to bring his MVP season from Kansas City Alex Smith might live up to his MVPesque season from last time but McCoy would live on as a below average backup QB forever. Alex Smith ain't the worst option after Kirk Cousins left. #27 Houston Texans Starter - Deshaun Watson. Backup - Brandon Weeden Deshaun Watson will have to be the player he was before the injury     Houston has Weeden as their backup to their sophomore superstar coming off an ACL injury, O'Brien would hope for a better option than that. The team hopes to stay fit next season and do some damage in AFC. #26 Dallas Cowboys Starter - Dak Prescott, Backup - Mike White, Cooper Rush Prescott will get his sidekick in Ezekial Elliott back for the season Dak and Zeke form a formidable offense but the Cowboys quarterback room could do better than Mike White and Rush. Jason Garrett must be hoping for Kellen Moore (probably not).     #25 Cincinnati Bengals Starter - Andy Dalton, Backup - Matt Barkley Dalton will have to bemoreconsistent upcoming season Cincinnati Bengals have changes looming in front of them, the coaching staff is in the hot seat and the QB room ain't helping. Andy Dalton has been used to define the term 'average' all over the NFL dictionary and Barkley never lived up to his high school potential. #24 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Starter - Winston, Backup - Ryan Fitzpatrick Tampa Bay will not have Winston for the first 3 weeks per suspension     Winston will serve his ban and Ryan Fitzpatrick will be QB-1 in the depth chart, sounds depressing, probably is. #23 Baltimore Ravens Starter/ Backup - Joe Flacco, Lamar Jackson. The QB competition is in full swing at Ravens camp Ravens' coaching has been immensely impressed with rookie Lamar Jackson. The reports from preseason indicate that Joe Flacco has been showing more initiation as well. Ravens will be looking to capitalize on a soft AFC. #22 Chicago Bears Starter - Mitchell Trubisky, Backup - Chase Daniels Trubisky can lead Bears to playoffs and become the greatest franchise QB     Bears have a new offensive system and Chase Daniel as the backup, who has come from the Chiefs system that Matt Nagy will be running. Trubisky needs to live up to his draft pedigree and Bears can easily jump to the next tier. #21 Buffalo Bills Starter - AJ McCarron, Backup - Josh Allen, Nathan Peterman The team will hope for Josh Allen to win the starting job Bills brought in McCarron from Bengals as an insurance policy to their Rookie, Josh Allen. Bills have an average starter, one raw rookie, and a backup with starting capabilities in Peterman. No one should be surprised if everyone gets a start in Buffalo.     #20 Denver Broncos Starter - Case Keenum, Backup - Paxton Lynch, Chad Kelly Keenum will hop to fill the big shoes of Peyton Manning Case Keenum had a career year last season but he won't have the similar support cast as Minnesota. Paxton Lynch has bust written all over him and won't even command a conditional pick in return. #19 Tennessee Titans Starter - Marcus Mariota, Backup - Blaine Gabbert Mariota needs to bounce back from a dreadful last season     Titans have been a run first team but Mariota needs to improve his play for them to compete against Houston in the division. Gabbert can be a great backup in the correct system with his cannon arm and great mobility. #18 New York Giants Starter - Eli Manning, Backup - Davis Webb/ Kyle Lauletta Eli Manning will have to deliver with the run game to support Eli Manning has lost way too many steps to be a top tier QB but his stellar offensive sidekicks should take him to the belief land. Davis Webb has been making a lot of noise this offseason along with Kyle Lauletta at the backup position.     #17 Oakland Raiders Starter - Derek Carr, Backup - Connor Cooks Derek Carr will have to gel into Gruden's offense sooner than later Derek Carr underachieved last season. Cook and Carr will soon realize that life under Gruden is not as rosy as Gruden Camp. The team has Jeff Fisher vibes of finishing 8-8. #16 Detroit Lions Starter - Matthew Stafford, Backup - Matt Cassel Stafford can rise up to the next level     Stafford has one of the best arm seen in the sport but he needs a better support cast. How does Matt Cassel still have a job in NFL, even though it is as a backup? #15 Atlanta Falcons Starter - Matt Ryan, Backup - Matt Schaub Matt Ryan can bring the Falcons to the top Matt Ryan has had a legendary career till now, without winning the big one. The bad news is that they have Matt Schaub as the backup. #14 New Orleans Saints Starter - Drew Brees, Backup - Tom Savage     Drew Brees will look to take Saints further than last time Saints are moving on to a more run-heavy offense which might help the longevity of Brees. Saints are one of the big boys of NFC and Brees would love to make one last run before father time gets him. Tom Savage is not what you dream of as a backup but Saints don't have an option. Hill is the scout team QB who is turning heads at camp. #13 Seattle Seahawks Starter - Russell Wilson, Backup - Austin Davis     Russell Wilson will look for some help from the run offense Russell Wilson is a one-man offense for Seahawks with zero run game, no O-line help and below par receiving core. Russell Wilson does it all but sadly Austin Davis can't. The diminishing quality of Seahawks defense makes their chances of playoff dim. #12 Los Angeles Rams LA Rams - Starter - Jared Goff, Backup - Sean Mannion Goff will look to improve on his stellar performance last season     Jared Goff took a big leap last season. Sean McVay has been a godsend to Rams offense. Sean Mannion is not the best backup option but he has been in the system and a good subordinate to the young future of Los Angeles. Goff is a sneaky MVP candidate with Gurley by the sides. #11 Pittsburgh Steelers Starter - Roethlisberger, Backup - Mason Rudolph/ Landry Jones Roethlisberger will look to capitalize on Bell's last year in Pittsburgh Steelers have a complete offense led by Big Ben. His two quarterback understudies are raw and with minimal arm talent. Roethlisberger has been injured in bits and pieces over the last few seasons and the weak backup situation doesn't help the Steelers.     #10 Los Angeles Chargers Starter - Rivers, Backup - Geno Smith/ Cardale Jones Rivers will be looking for some luck and support from the fans Rivers is a great starter with a competent backup in Geno Smith. The run game led by Melvin Gordon with the receiving talent of Keenan Allen would be a handful for any defense. If the team stays fit, they can be a challenger for the AFC title. #09 San Francisco 49ers Starter - Jimmy Garoppolo, Backup - CJ Bethard Jimmy G will look to become Jimmy GQ     Garoppolo ended the 49ers season last year with 5 wins. The only way for the 49ers is up. Kyle Shanahan has one of the most sophisticated offenses in the league. CJ Bethard as the backup is a little suspect. Bay area is waiting for Jimmy G to become Jimmy Jesus. #8 Cleveland Browns Starter - Tyrod Taylor, Backup - Baker Mayfield/ Drew Stanton Baker and Tyrod will look to bring back the glory at Cleveland Browns were the worst team in Football but they have added to every position on the pitch. Taylor is a dependable QB, who can give you 5 wins on his worst day. Baker is the future with great football ethics and Drew Stanton will be a great third QB while developing a rookie. Browns look like a sneaky break out team for the upcoming season.     #07 Green Bay Packers Starter - Aaron Rodgers, Backup - DeShone Kizer Rodgers will be without his favorite wide receiver next season Rodgers has been known to hide most of the blemishes of his team. Packers traded for Kizer to be the backup, who was the QB of a 16 loss team. The addition of Jimmy Graham at tight end position will come as a great help after Nelson left. #06 New England Patriots Starter - Tom Brady, Backup - Brian Hoyer/ Danny Etling Brady will look to defy father time for one more season     Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time. Brian Hoyer is definitely not the greatest backup quarterback of all time. Brady's age is a sign of trouble but he is the reigning MVP of the league. Patriots have drafted Danny Etling in the late rounds who could turn up to be a great option for the future. #05 Indianapolis Colts Starter - Andrew Luck, Backup - Jacoby Brissett Luck finally looks set to be back alongside promising backup in Brissett If Andrew Luck wasn't coming back from injury, Colts could have been the top team in this exercise. Brissett has been a great trade by Colts. Luck has started training again and the revamped offensive line won't hurt either. The future looks bright for the franchise.     #04 New York Jets Starter/ Backup - Darnold, Josh McCown, Bridgewater Jets will have one of the most balanced quarterback room No one expected Jets to end up this high on the list but they have a great experienced starter and teacher in Josh McCown. They arguably got the best quarterback from the recent draft in Sam Darnold and they signed Teddy Bridgewater for free in the offseason. Bridgewater is the biggest trade asset in the league and front-runner for the comeback player of the year. Jets have stability at the position for the first time in a long time.     #03 Minnesota Vikings Starter - Kirk Cousins, Backup - Trevor Siemian Cousins will be expected to live up to his price tag The future looks bright for the franchise. Kirk Cousins is underrated even after being the costliest player in football and Siemian is as good a backup as any. Vikings will try to make the run in a loaded NFC. #02 Arizona Cardinals Starter - Sam Bradford, Backup - Josh Rosen/ Mike Glennon Rosen will look to earn the starts while Bradford needs to stay fit     The Cardinals have one of the most polished QB coming out of College in Rosen. Sam Bradford can be a top 15 quarterback when fit. The quarterback room compliments each other, unlike any other team. Cardinals can shock a lot of people next season. #01 Philadelphia Eagles Starter - Carson Wentz, Backup - Nick Foles Eagles would love another Philly special, with Wentz this time Nick Foles just won Philly the Superbowl, while the future MVP of the league (Wentz) was sidelined with an injury. Eagles have things sorted till Foles gets traded for too many draft picks. The Eagles QB room might just help them reach the mountaintop again. The in-depth look into every quarterback room made me realize that Matt Cassel, Matt Schaub, and Landry Jones will keep having backup jobs in 2096 and no one will ever notice. In conclusion. my biggest fear is that Blake Bortles will end up winning the Superbowl and make this article as irrelevant as his throwing motion.

Mike White\'s stranglehold on the football-loving public\'s imagination is over, as the New York Jets announced that they would start Joe Flacco for their Sunday contest against the Miami Dolphins (1 p.m. ET, CBS). White put in a literal Hall of Fame performance on Oct. 31 against the Cincinnati Bengals, becoming the first NFL quarterback to throw for 400 yards and three touchdowns in his first career start.

However, reality intervened in the form of the Buffalo Bills, who victimized White for four interceptions in a 45-17 loss. Flacco led the Jets to their final score in the fourth quarter and returned to New York after spending the most recent preseason in Philadelphia.

Many would probably expect legends like Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, George Blanda, and Y.A. Tittle to appear on the list. Others, like Nick Foles and Joe Kapp, were able to carve professional football legacies beyond their high-scoring affairs but the addition of Adrian Burk is one that will certainly raise eyebrows among non-football historians.     Burk was the second overall pick of the 1950 NFL Draft but spent a relatively uneventful seven seasons with the Colts and Eagles. But an October 1954 afternoon with the latter helped him make history, as he threw seven touchdowns on only 27 attempts in a 49-21 win over Washington, becoming the first to earn that historic tally. That triumph was one of only 15 victories Burk would earn as a starter in his NFL career. Despite his history in a helmet, Burk is perhaps better known for his officiating endeavors as a back judge. Ironically, he was present when Kapp pulled off the feat in 1969. Burk was also part of the officiating crew for Franco Harris\' Immaculate Reception during the 1972-73 playoffs.

A 41-34 win for the Cleveland Browns over the Kansas City Chiefs featured over 900 yards of offense, 286 of which came from Browns running back Jerome Harrison. Harrison\'s tally was good for the third-best single-game rushing tally in NFL history. To put that in perspective, Harrison tallied only 301 total over the first 13 games of the 2008 season. That was enough for Cleveland to bring him back on a new contract and grant him the top rushing duties for the following season. Alas, Harrison was traded to Philadelphia in October of the following year. He was nearly sent back to the Eagles after signing with Detroit over the offseason, but he failed his physical after Philadelphia doctors discovered a brain tumor. Some expected Harrison to be a quadraplegic after the ordeal, but he has since regained most of his motor skills through a rigorous recovery process.     Flynn (10) threw for 480 yards in a 45-41 win (Photo: Getty) 1/1/12: Flynn the Money The NFL history of the Green Bay Packers has been written by aerial legends: Bart Starr, Brett Favre, Aaron Rodgers, and...Matt Flynn??? Titletown\'s single-game record for passing yards and touchdowns is held by Flynn, a seventh-round pick of the Packers in the 2008 draft. Flynn had made a single start entering Week 17 of the 2011-12 NFL season, when he was called upon to relieve a resting Rodgers before the top-seeded Packers began their playoff trek. Despite the relative lack of stakes, Flynn wowed audiences with a 480-yard, six-touchdown showing as the Packers earned a 45-41 victory over the Detroit Lions.     Flynn\'s output was enough to convince the Seattle Seahawks to shell out the big bucks: a three-year, $20.5 million contract awaited in the ensuing offseason, along with the implication that Flynn was the team\'s new franchise man. Alas for Flynn, the drafting of a third-round pick named Russell Wilson changed everything. He lasted only two more seasons in the NFL after that, a stretch that included a return to Green Bay in 2013-14. Gray scores one of his four touchdowns in the win over the Colts (Photo: Getty) 11/16/14: Gray Matter It has become a tiring NFL cliche/meme to say that Bill Belichick can win with anyone. But that axiom rang dangerously true during a November 2014 prime-time contest between Belichick\'s New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts.     With regular rushers Stevan Ridley and LeGarrette Blount unavailable, the Patriots bestowed their duties on Gray. That Sunday night\'s showdown against the Colts was the one-month anniversary of his promotion to the Patriots\' active roster. He went on to torch the Colts for 201 rushing yards and four scores, becoming the first player in the NFL\'s modern era to earn a touchdown quartet after entering the game with none. New England would win the game 42-20 and Gray earned cover duties for the ensuing week\'s issue of Sports Illustrated. Alas, Belichick giveth and Belichick taketh away: Gray took the costliest nap of his life during the ensuing week of practice, as his oversleeping made him late for practice after his phone died. Gray was originally suspended for a ""violation of team rules"" after the incident, but wound up being a healthy scratch in all but four of the Patriots\' remaining games that season. He was released by the Patriots at the end of training camp in 2015 and failed to catch on in Miami or Jacksonville.

The Jets QB has recently been under a lot of pressure from his teammates for not performing well enough to win them games, despite stellar performances by the team's defense.  That being said, the Jets have now decided to bench their 2021 second-overall pick for the foreseeable future in favor of backup QB Mike White. The 27-year-old quarterback lit up the league with his recent performance and is now looking to make the Jets' QB1 role his own.        And by the looks of it, his teammates sure are happy about the change. Multiple Jets stars were seen sporting Mike White t-shirts as they prepared to board their plane for Minnesota to take on the high-flying Vikings.

Ahmad 'Sauce' Gardner The Jets currently have a 7-4 record and are third in the highly competitive AFC East behind the likes of the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins.    White, while adored by Jets fans and players alike, has a tough task cut out for him this weekend against the Vikings, who sit top of the NFC North with a 9-2 record. Whether or not White can sustain his magic against the NFC franchise remains to be seen. But if he manages to lodge another three-touchdown performance in Week 13, things will surely get more difficult for Zach Wilson going forward.      Is Zach Wilson playing tonight against the Minnesota Vikings in Week 13? Zach Wilson will not start against the Vikings this Sunday as Mike White will remain the starting QB for the Jets for the second straight week. Franchise head coach Robert Saleh informed reporters on Friday that the QB will remain inactive and veteran Joe Flacco will be the backup to Mike White.

White will look to continue his hot streak against a Vikings pass defense which is currently ranked dead last in the NFL.     "", 'Is Mike White playing tonight against Colts?  On the heels of a heroic performance against one of the best teams in the AFC, the New York Jets and many fans are hoping to get a second look at backup quarterback Mike White. Was the win against the Cincinnati Bengals a fluke or have the Jets finally found something in him?   For the Jets to know for sure, they\'ll need to look at him a second time.        However, the flip side is that rookie quarterback Zach Wilson was the original plan before his knee injury sidelined him for the Bengals game. If the Jets decide to take an extended look at Mike White, it could mean the end for Wilson.            That said, if Wilson is still unable to play due to injury, the Jets could be in a perfect spot to keep Wilson\'s future on the docket while also getting another look at White. Will Zach Wilson\'s injury keep him out of tonight\'s game? Will Mike White play tonight in relief of Zach Wilson? Zach Wilson is working through a PCL injury in his knee, according to CBS Sports. Usually, severe knee injuries can knock players out for the season.  However, this is not that type of injury and Wilson won\'t miss the rest of 2021. That said, he won\'t be able to play tonight against the Colts and is out.      Wilson is expected to return in Week 10 against the Buffalo Bills. Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterIt’s another Mike White Day.3:29 AM · Nov 4, 2021221381158It’s another Mike White Day. https://t.co/Kv8DuXEEU7 It is no surprise that Wilson will not be playing in tonight\'s game against the Indianapolis Colts. He was unable to play on Sunday, and four days is rarely enough time to recover from any game-ending injury.  However, with the Jets facing a somewhat lengthy nine-day ""mini-bye"" after the game, Wilson should be able to make a recovery and return to the field in Week 10 barring any setbacks.

Against the Bengals, White threw for 405 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions.         If he can have a similar performance tonight, he could give the Jets a big question heading into the mini-bye. Will the Jets return to Wilson when healthy or ride with White? Zach Wilson at New York Jets v Atlanta Falcons The Jets may be quietly hoping they lose the game so they don\'t have to make that decision. If they do lose, White will likely return to the bench and Wilson will return as the starter. However, if White repeats Sunday\'s performance, the Jets will have a tough decision on their hands. For the Jets, tonight\'s game could suddenly change the trajectory of the franchise and certainly that of Mike White.     ', 'Zach Wilson should never start again after Mike White leads the Jets to victory  The New York Jets looked ready to implode just a week ago after an embarrassing 10-3 loss against the New England Patriots. The team entered the day with a 6-3 record and was coming off a bye. Yet somehow, Zach Wilson looked worse than ever.  He finished with a subpar 9/22 for 77 yards. Things were so ugly that the coaching staff decided to bench him in favor of backup Mike White.        So how did that turn out? Well, it looks like White has earned the job for the remainder of the season. That is if the Jets are serious about making the postseason.            Mike White got the Jets back on track White and the Jets were given a break when the Chicago Bears ruled Justin Fields out with an injury. That left Trevor Siemian as the starter. But White still had to take it to the Chicago defense, which he did with ease. He finished 22/28 for 315 yards and three touchdowns. He carved up the Chicago defense and made it clear that this Jets team is capable of great things if they have competent play at quarterback. For reference, Wilson, a former No. 2 overall pick, has four passing touchdowns all season. NFL on CBS 🏈@NFLonCBSMike White has 3 Pass TD todayZach Wilson has NEVER thrown 3 Pass TD in a game in his career2724311Mike White has 3 Pass TD todayZach Wilson has NEVER thrown 3 Pass TD in a game in his career https://t.co/g2EMc6q0Fo     Fans in New York will remember that White has shown his abilities before, most notably in 2021 when he threw for 405 yards in a shocking win over the Cincinnati Bengals. Yet his chance ended a few weeks later when he tossed four interceptions against the Buffalo Bills. Any quarterback is capable of lighting it up one week, only to engineer an epic collapse the next. Yet one thing remains true: the team cannot go back to Wilson, even if that means inserting Joe Flacco if things go south for White. This is an awkward situation as the team drafted Wilson at No. 2 overall in 2021. But his performance against the Patriots was simply too demoralizing. White stepped in a week later and suddenly, the offense was thriving. Both Garrett Wilson and Elijah Moore looked like stars, combining for three touchdowns against the Bears. Richard Sherman@RSherman_25With Mike White everybody eats B! Elijah Moore welcome back!https://t.co/FYYlJy1ir1 twitter.com/i/web/status/1…56362With Mike White everybody eats B! Elijah Moore welcome back!https://t.co/FYYlJy1ir1 twitter.com/i/web/status/1…Wilson is far too limited, at least at this point in time, to lead a team into the postseason. That means the Jets must be smart and acknowledge the obvious for the remainder of the year, even if that means giving up on a former top pick.     ', 'Mike White permanent starter over Zach Wilson? Here\'s why the Jets should consider that  The New York Jets entered the 2021 season with plenty of hope, believing they\'d found their next franchise quarterback after drafting BYU product Zach Wilson.  The high level of optimism quickly dissipated through the first half of the campaign because the Jets have stumbled toward another disappointing year. Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled with his performance. He’s been sidelined with a knee injury that forced him to miss the last few games.        Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterJets’ HC Robert Saleh announced QB Mike White will start Sunday vs. Buffalo.9:43 AM · Nov 10, 202112244622Jets’ HC Robert Saleh announced QB Mike White will start Sunday vs. Buffalo.           Mike White has sparked a QB controversy for the Jets This has opened the door for Mike White to step in to fill the starting job. He has shown enough to prove to first-year head coach Robert Saleh that he will keep the spot. On Wednesday, Saleh stated that the team will “organically” move back to Wilson as the starter when the time is appropriate. ""If Mike is playing phenomenal football, it is what it is,"" Saleh said via ESPN. ""You might call it a controversy or not. I can pull up an article from every single one of you guys that has mentioned that the best thing for a young quarterback is to watch, so there\'s no harm in either way.     ""We have the utmost confidence in Zach. When he gets back on the football field and he\'s ready to play, he\'s going to do a phenomenal job. His talent is undeniable. There\'s a great amount of growth that can happen whether he\'s playing or not. Those are facts. Those are history-proven throughout the history of time. Playing or not playing, you can get both done."" However, it shows the team is more confident in White’s ability. In his first three starts, he has tallied 702 passing yards with five touchdowns to four interceptions while holding a 95.9 passer rating. Much of the optimism is fueled by his strong performance in the upset 34-31 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, where he threw for 405 yards with three touchdown passes to two interceptions. It hasn’t been a clean transition to White, but he has been able to move the ball down the field consistently. Meanwhile, Wilson struggled to find any stability as he’s thrown nine interceptions in six games while holding a 63.5 passer rating.

It’s no shot at him, but not every quarterback is ready at the get-go to lead the charge. If anything, Wilson can benefit from learning on the sidelines. That could prove to be instrumental to his success once he gets his next shot.Meanwhile, White can continue to build on his strong, brief performance, showing what could turn out to be the spark he needs to ignite his career. There is no pressure to play Wilson if he’s not ready, and the 26-year-old Western Kentucky product is providing the team that leeway to do that.     ', 'Who is Lotus White writer Mike White?

The New York Jets are experimenting with their quarterback position and will start Mike White in the Week 12 game against the Chicago Bears. The Jets have once again slipped to last place in the AFC East after last week\'s 3-10 loss to the New England Patriots.  The Jets have been impressive this season and are 6-4. Two of their losses have been to New England, a frustrating stat for the franchise. Due to poor performances and some unhelpful post-match comments from Zach Wilson, the Jets will be starting their backup QB instead.

Wilson held the starting job from Week 4 to 11, but failed to put up the numbers the franchise and fantasy managers were looking for. It will be interesting to see if Wilson gets back to the starting opportunity this season. In Week 12, however, White will get his chance to prove himself. If you have Zach Wilson on your roster, you\'ve likely kept him on the bench for most of the season. This may be an apt time to part ways with the quarterback, who is definitely trending in the wrong direction.     Mike White has the potential to score good fantasy points in Week 12, and we saw that last season. While playing against the Cincinnati Bengals, White threw for 405 yards, three touchdown passes and two interceptions. He scored 26.1 fantasy points in that game. He played only four games last season and earned a total of 44.1 fantasy points. This presents an interesting situation for managers streaming QBs. Do you take a risk on White? Depending on the size of your league, he could be worth the gamble. If your league is 12+ players, he could be worth a shot, but he is a desperate measure of desperate times. Realistically, there are better options likely available to be streamed.

The 23-year-old will replace Mike White, who is still recovering from a rib injury sustained in his last game against the Buffalo Bills.  Wilson was benched by the New York outfit midseason after a string of dire performances despite leading the team to five wins and two defeats. White then took charge of the Jets offense in their last three games. While he has performed statistically better than Wilson, the Jets are 1-2 with White starting.

3,Gardner Minshew,"[""3 biggest talking points from Trevor Lawrence's performance against Saints in preseason game  Trevor Lawrence got his first taste of the bright lights of Monday Night Football against the New Orleans Saints.  The number one overall pick put on an excellent performance against the Saints. In the process, Jacksonville's fan base got a great glimpse of what their season could look like with Lawrence at quarterback. The former Clemson quarterback looked more confident in the offense.        If the Jaguars are telling the truth about a QB controversy between Trevor Lawrence and Gardner Minshew (and it's unclear whether they are), maybe they should have taken Zach Wilson.— ProFootballTalk (@ProFootballTalk) August 23, 2021           Here are three of the most significant talking points from Trevor Lawrence's second start in the NFL.  #1 Trevor Lawrence played mistake-free football two weeks in a row Trevor Lawrence completed six of his nine passes for 71 yards, and didn't throw a single interception against the Cleveland Browns in Week 1. He followed up his Week-1 performance with an even better showing against the Saints. Trevor Lawrence turned on the jets ⚡️️(via @NFL)pic.twitter.com/6KMd11e1ZI— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) August 24, 2021     Thus Lawrence has made a valid argument on why he deserves to be QB1 in Jacksonville. The rookie quarterback completed 14 of his 23 passes for 113 yards. His most significant stat was going back-to-back weeks without throwing an interception.  #2 Despite not turning the ball over, Trevor Lawrence is still looking for his first TD pass During his time at Clemson, Trevor Lawrence didn't have a problem throwing touchdowns. Lawrence threw for 90 touchdown passes during his three years at Clemson. The way it looks, Lawrence will head into the 2021 regular season without a single touchdown pass. The quarterback position is one of the most challenging spots to play in the NFL. So, Lawrence's slow start is expected, as he is a rookie quarterback. Unfortunately for Lawrence, he finds himself in an unfamiliar situation. The former college star quarterback finds himself in a quarterback battle with Gardner Minshew. Every snap Lawrence takes could determine whether he starts or sits Week 1 of the regular season.      #3 Trevor Lawrence hasn't locked up the starting QB job after two starts Urban Meyer has one of the most challenging decisions of his young coaching career in the NFL. The former Ohio State head coach will need to decide soon on which quarterback will start Week 1 of the regular season. As things stand, neither Trevor Lawrence nor Gardner Minshew has created separation. Minshew and Lawrence both have played average football over the last two games. Where the rookie quarterback holds a slight lead, Minshew is in the turnover category. Minshew has thrown interceptions in back-to-back weeks, while Lawrence hasn't thrown a single one.Urban Meyer can either give the fans what they want, or control his team and go against the fan base. That's a decision fans are happy they do not have to make.     "", '5 best landing spots for Gardner Minshew\xa0  Gardner Minshew was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the sixth round of the 2019 NFL Draft. At the time, he was considered the future quarterback of the franchise, but it seems that time has come and gone.  In 2019, Gardner Minshew became the starting quarterback after Nick Foles was injured in Week 1 of the season. Minshew went on to appear in 14 games, starting 12, throwing for 3,271 yards and 21 touchdowns.        Before the 2020 season, Foles was traded, making Gardner Minshew the starting quarterback for the Jaguars. After Minshew sustained injuries, Mike Glennon and Jake Luton received opportunities to start. When Gardner Minshew returned, the Jaguars weren\'t happy with his performance and replaced him in Week 15 with Mike Glennon.           The Jaguars have now drafted their new starting quarterback,Trevor Lawrence. The team signed former San Francisco 49ers backup C.J. Beathard as the backup, while Jake Luton would be third in the depth chart. That puts Gardner Minshew the odd man out, and the Jacksonville Jaguars are interested in trading him. On that note, let\'s have a look at five NFL teams that could be a good fit for Minshew. Frangie Show: Gardner Minshew was not at #Jaguars voluntary OTAs today. Urban Meyer said he expects him back Monday.""Urban has praised him publicly, but feels like in all likelihood, he\'s not going to be here this year."" - @HaysCarlyon pic.twitter.com/uVcC0i4bHt— 1010 XL / 92.5 FM (@1010XL) June 3, 2021      #1 Tennesse Titans The Tennessee Titans recently traded for wide receiver Julio Jones and have a solid offense that includes quarterback Ryan Tannehill. While Tannehill is the obvious starter in Tennessee, the depth behind him doesn\'t have a lot of experience. DeShone Kizer and Logan Woodside are the current backups to Tannehill. If either were to start in place of Tannehill, their offense might not be able to utilize all of their offensive weapons. So trading for Gardner Minshew would allow the Titans to have a solid, reliable backup quarterback, one who has a big arm and could use his legs if the need be.  #2 Carolina Panthers This off-season, the Carolina Panthers traded Teddy Bridgewater with the Denver Broncos and acquired Sam Darnold from the New York Jets. The Panthers believe offensive coordinator Joe Brady would fix any issues Darnold has had so far in his career. Darnold\'s current backup is PJ Walker, who was not only a solid Temple quarterback but also an XFL one with the Houston Roughnecks. Acquiring Gardner Minshew could be good for the Panthers because if Darnold\'s issues don\'t get resolved, the former could end up becoming their starting quarterback.     REPORT: The Jaguars might accept a 5th or 6th round pick for QB Gardner Minshew. pic.twitter.com/wPeLzhdlLA— JPA Football 🏈 (@jpafootball) June 11, 2021   #3 Indianapolis Colts The Colts traded for Carson Wentz. While they probably won\'t be trading for a backup quarterback, too, especially in their own division, it might be a good idea. Wentz has struggled to stay on the field his entire career because of injuries. The Colts\' current backup quarterback options are Jacob Eason and 2021 draft pick Sam Ehlinger. Both are young and without experience, so if Wentz were to have injury issues again, the Colts would be in a tough bind.      #4 Houston Texans Deshaun Watson\'s situation hasn\'t had any updates lately, so it is not known if or when the quarterback would start the 2021 season. The Texans drafted Davis Mills out of Stanford in this year\'s draft. The Texans also signed Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel as backup options. But with the type of offense the Texans run, Gardner Minshew might be better suited than the above options if Watson is no longer one.#5 Washington Football TeamThe Washington Football Team has added a few key pieces to their offense this off-season. Veteran journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick signed with Washington after spending two seasons with the Miami Dolphins. Fitzpatrick won\'t be the starting quarterback in the long term, so Washington will need another option soon. Gardner Minshew could be that one.     ', ""Does Gardner Minshew have a girlfriend?  Gardner Minshew isn't just a great quarterback; he's also a very attractive young man. Minshew has been eye candy since he was drafted into the league, and the news that he could start again has been well-received. Minshew is the Philadelphia Eagles backup quarterback to Jalen Hurts. He has worked hard in that role and has never questioned the head coach's decision.

Despite his large following on all social media platforms, Minshew has kept his dating life under wraps.

View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Gardner Minshew's Career Timeline Gardner Minshew was drafted in the sixth round of the 2019 NFL Draft. The Jacksonville Jaguars drafted him as their future quarterback. Minshew took the opportunity with both hands and put up a fantastic rookie stat line of 3,271 passing yards, 21 touchdowns, and six interceptions in 14 games. His next season was just as impressive, with the then-year-two Pro putting up a stat line of 2,259 passing yards, 16 touchdowns, and five interceptions in six games. However, his efforts weren't enough to keep him in Jacksonville, as the Jaguars traded him to the Philadelphia Eagles to make room for an incoming Trevor Lawrence.     Since joining Philly, Minshew has played as a backup for the regular playoff contenders. He has played in a mere seven games for Philly, thrown for under 500 passing yards, scored four touchdowns, and been intercepted once. He hopes to improve that stat line on Saturday when he takes to the Gridiron without starting quarterback Jalen Hurts.Overall, Minshew has played in thirty NFL games. He has racked up a stat line of 41 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and a passer rating of 93.9 for his career.

Would signing him be a good move for the quarterback-needy Indianapolis Colts?  Yes, signing Minshew would be a solid move for the Colts.        The Colts were one of the NFL's worst teams this past season, finishing with a 4-12-1 record. When you lack a franchise quarterback, it's extremely difficult to win in today's NFL. Take a look around the league. The top teams possess a superstar signal-caller like Patrick Mahomes, Jalen Hurts or Joe Burrow.

Gardner Minshew began his career with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019. Minshew was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the sixth round (178th overall pick) of the 2019 NFL Draft. He ended up starting 12 games as a rookie, throwing for 3,271 yards, 21 touchdowns and six interceptions. After starting eight games for the Jaguars the following season, Minshew was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in August 2021 as he became a backup.

He threw for 355 yards and two touchdowns although the Eagles lost 40-34. In his career thus far, Minshew has started 24 of 32 games, producing 6,632 passing yards, 44 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.  Gardner Minshew knows Shane Steichen's offense. Ever since Andrew Luck retired in 2019, the Colts have gone the veteran quarterback route, acquiring players like Philip Rivers, Carson Wentz and Matt Ryan. This year should be different, though, as the Colts are expected to draft a quarterback. The team owns the fourth overall pick in the draft and will likely select Alabama's Bryce Young, Ohio State's C.J. Stroud or Kentucky's Will Levis.If that happens, a bridge quarterback could be acquired to fill in until the youngster is ready to start. Minshew would be perfect for that role. He played for new Colts head coach Shane Steichen, who served as the Eagles' offensive coordinator. Plus, if the rookie quarterback struggles mightily, Minshew could take over as the starter.

Jacksonville Jaguars QB Gardner Minshew ll took the NFL by storm as an unknown sixth-round selection in 2019. When he took over for the injured Nick Foles in the season opener, he became a fan favorite.  Between his burly physique, his mullet and the handlebar mustache, Minshew became a pop culture icon nearly overnight. In 2019, Minshew\'s had a 6-6 record as a starter and threw 21 TDs and 6 INTs. He earned a starting role in 2020 but battled injuries and a decline in his performance (1-7 record).

Minshew essentially lost his starting job, forced to settle as a backup. To add salt to the wound, the team signed four-year veteran QB CJ Beathard right before the draft to compete with Gardner Minshew. From QB1 to possible QB3, where does Gardner Minshew go from here? Both Urban Meyer and OC Darell Bevell have nothing but positive things to say about Gardner Minshew during interviews. Bevell said he\'s impressed with the way he carries himself on and off the field.     Meyer says he\'s been working on building a strong relationship with his QB. Most players in this situation would have already demanded a trade. Gardner Minshew, though, isn\'t most players and hasn\'t asked for a trade, though some teams have called with interest. Gardner Minshew trade value and possible destinations After months of speculation about Minshew\'s next turn in the NFL, the Jaguars have finally revealed their asking price and it\'s a draft pick in either the fifth or the sixth round. For someone who has a 6-6 record as a rookie, that could be a bargain. ESPN\'s Jeremy Fowler has reported that Gardner Minshew would like a chance to compete for the QB1 spot wherever he lands. That limits the teams that will continue to barter for his talents. The Carolina Panthers have emerged as contenders, but Sam Darnold seems to be their starter this year. The Dallas Cowboys are another team and would prefer to have Gardner Minshew as Dak Prescott\'s backup if he has an injury setback.     Philadelphia is an intriguing spot with QB Jalen Hurts not quite named the starter yet. Minshew would have a legit shot to be the starter, but it\'s late in the offseason, too. Houston is another team on the list with Deshaun Watson\'s future still murky. Their backup options aren\'t very inspiring either. Minshew has a knack for learning new offenses on the fly with success, playing in four different systems in college and several in the NFL already. The impact of a Gardner Minshew trade on the Jaguars Trevor Lawrence is a generational talent and CJ Beathard has performed well enough in camp to remain in the battle for QB2. From a financial viewpoint, there\'s little impact on the Jaguars. Jacksonville has plenty of cap space to play with and cutting either Minshew ($95K dead money) or Beathard ($2.5 million dead money) is unlikely to make the franchise lose any sleep. The team would only get a Day 3 pick in either trade.     As for experience,Gardner Minshew has been with the team for two years and has a decent relationship with his teammates, both new and old. Minshew seems a bit more talented than Beathard and part of his 2020 decline likely stemmed from his unreported thumb injury. One of the few flaws coaches have pointed out is that he tends to leave the pocket too early. Minshew would be one of the better backups in the league if he were to stay with Jacksonville. If something were to happen to Trevor Lawrence, the coaches would prefer to have a proven player in their system to step up. Gardner Minshew’s mullet is gone, but what a run it had. We’ll always remember its beauty.

He\'s been keeping his head down and showing up at training so far. He\'ll likely beat out CJ Beathard by the end of camp and will work closely with Lawrence throughout the season. However, Minshew is still destined to leave the team this year. The likely scenarios Philadelphia HC Nick Sirianni isn\'t completely ready to give Jalen Hurts the go-ahead and there\'s a chance Hurts won\'t pan out or suffers an injury. Dak Prescott could also suffer an injury setback, leaving Dallas without a capable QB. Deshaun Watson could be ineligible to play at any time now. Gardner Minshew\'s best path is to continue to grow in Florida and prove the injury was the cause of his decline. At some point in the season, there will likely be a team that is in dire need of his services as a starter.If no team has a QB issue (unlikely) and there\'s no trade offer that suits all parties, Minshew will stay put in Jacksonville until next offseason. Teams can then bring Gardner Minshew in early enough to get a feel for the system and have a fighting shot.

He did great with the Jaguars, bringing some stability to the franchise. However, he was dealt to the Eagles after two productive seasons, with the Jaguars choosing to focus on tanking for Trevor Lawrence. Since joining the Eagles, he has exclusively served as a backup for Jalen Hurts and has embraced that role for the time being.           Minshew signed a four-year contract worth $2,710,884.

The Washington State University alum was a stud in college, and he ensured that his University team was never blown out of the water by more illustrious competition. However, since joining the league as a sixth-round pick, he has had an up-and-down career, to put it mildly. He started his NFL journey with the Jacksonville Jaguars at a franchise that looked to entrust him with the key to their franchise for the long run. He repaid that trust by putting back-to-back solid seasons by a starting quarterback's standard.

With ample opportunity to prepare, Minshew should be able to start the upcoming Week 16 game.  To claim the number 1 seed in the NFC, the 13-1 Philadelphia Eagles only have to win one of their next three outings. Hurts would likely want to go no matter what, but the Eagles might decide to bench him to allow him to recover fully and be prepared for the playoffs.

In his rookie year, he rapidly established himself as the team\'s main starting QB and set the team record for throwing touchdowns by a first-year QB. He was moved to the Philadelphia Eagles the following year, where he has been the team\'s number two QB, after an injury cut short his 2020 season. Minshew has only featured in two full games in the regular season in Philadelphia after playing a total of 23 games over the last two years in Jacksonville, where he threw for 37 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.      One of the two complete games Minshew has played was against a weak New York Jets secondary in a top-10 fantasy performance, and the other in a difficult game versus the Dallas Cowboys in Week 18. He attempted eight deep balls, passed for 428 yards, 362 air yards, four touchdowns, and one interception in these two games.

He is a reliable thrower who displayed some skill when playing for the Jaguars in his first two NFL seasons. In his career, he has thrown for 41 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.     Jalen Hurts is seen as a top MVP-caliber, and the 26-year-old Minshew will have huge shoes to fill if he is selected in Week 16. Hurts threw for almost 3,500 yards and 22 TDs while also carrying for 747 yards and 13 scores.  Gardner Minshew\'s draft profile Gardner Minshew was among the three footballers from Washington State invited by the NFL to attend the NFL Scouting Combine in 2019.

They needed the San Francisco 49ers and the Philadelphia Eagles to lose and defeat the Commanders. But forget about the other teams, because they could not even take their end of the bargain.  They lost the game 26 - 6 and much of the blame fell on Dak Prescott. They were playing essentially a reserve team in the eliminated Commanders. They were the favorites to win this game. But by the end of the game, Dak Prescott had a 37.8 percent completion percentage, throwing for less than 130 passing yards, one touchdown, and one interception return for a touchdown. His passer rating was less than 50. It was a horrible performance and the fans let them know on Twitter what they thought of him.

Not exactly how you build momentum into a playoff game at Brady. Dak Prescott was mercifully withdrawn after this horrible performance. But it wasn\'t just that he lost this game. In the last three weeks, he has faced Gardner Minshew, Joshua Dobbs, and Sam Howell. Gardner Minshew is the backup quarterback to Jalen Hurts for the Philadelphia Eagles. Joshua Dobbs was playing his first game for the Tennessee Titans after signing from the Detroit Lions\' practice squad. Sam Howell is the third-choice quarterback for the Commanders behind Carson Wentz and Taylor Heinicke.     Each of these should have been blowout wins. Instead, they now go into the postseason severely bloodied and winded. They are looking to win their first Super Bowl of the millennium and Prescott\'s performance today does not give much hope. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are a 8-9 team with a losing record and the Cowboys should be favorites. But they still have Tom Brady and the Dallas Cowboys are as weak as they could be in the quarterback position.It was the worst possible outcome to their final regular season game. They will hope that it will not have any bearing on the playoffs. They have flattered to deceive in the postseason previously, and they will now be hoping their luck flips.     ', 'Are Philadelphia Eagles still unsure about QB Jalen Hurts? Philadelphia trades for Jacksonville QB Gardner Minshew  The Philadelphia Eagles may have made a very underrated roster move by acquiring QB Garnder Minshew from the Jacksonville Jaguars, adding to a roster with Jalen Hurts and Joe Flacco already in place. Gardner Minshew lost a QB ""battle"" that he was never seriously going to win against the number one overall pick Trevor Lawrence. Minshew was a breakout star in 2019 when he took over for Nick Foles. In 2020, he struggled on the field with a lingering hand injury that impacted his performance. The Jaguars drafted Lawrence, a generational talent, and it was just a matter of time before they traded Gardner Minshew as he wasn\'t going to unseat Trevor Lawrence any time soon.  Trade: #Eagles have acquired QB Gardner Minshew from Jacksonville in exchange for a conditional sixth-round pick in 2022. The team also released QB Nick Mullens. pic.twitter.com/MLYrJfymxE— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) August 28, 2021        Gardner Minshew trade shows uncertainty with Jalen Hurts...and Jacksonville Jaguars head coach?           Enter the Philadelphia Eagles, who have been in deep thought on what Jalen Hurts\' future holds with the team. Through three NFL preseason games, Jalen Hurts saw action only in Week 1 as the starter (3/7 for 54 yards). QB Joe Flacco played most of the preseason and played well, too. Philadelphia seems to be hinting to Jalen Hurts that his time as a starter could be in jeopardy by offering a sixth-round pick for Gardner Minshew. So yes, the Philadelphia Eagles are still not sold on Jalen Hurts being the face of their franchise. That doesn\'t mean he\'ll be benched immediately for Flacco or Minshew, who is #3 on the depth chart. The team does have options at QB now though, if injury, COVID-19, or regression strikes Jalen Hurts. Flacco had a great preseason and showed he can still perform with success in the NFL, but he\'s not suited to lead Nick Sirianni\'s offense. It requires a smaller, more mobile and athletic player and that has never been Joe Flacco. Gardner Minshew, on the other hand, looks like a prime candidate for such a system. The Eagles do not know if he\'ll be more like the 2019 or 2020 Gardner Minshew, though. It would be smart not to give Minshew responsibilities on the offense before he earns them.     Eagles just landed a 25-year old QB that has completed 62.9% with 37 TD, only 11 INT, and 93.1% rating in his first two seasons for a stinking 6th round pick. Gardner Minshew is a winning NFL quarterback. Absolute no-brainer deal for Howie Roseman.— Jim Nagy (@JimNagy_SB) August 28, 2021 Jacksonville dropped the ball with Gardner Minshew Giving up a sixth-round pick for a QB with 5,530 passing yards and 37 passing TDs in two years is a steal and says more about the dysfunction and uncertainty in Jacksonville than Philadelphia. The so-called QB competition seemed like an act to boost Minshew\'s trade value, which failed obviously and leaves HC Urban Meyer to be criticized for such a move. Still, Philadelphia does well to have extra options at QB, something they\'ve been known to do over the years.     Despite playing 13 less full games, Jalen Hurts had more 300+ passing yard performances than Baker Mayfield.In Hurts’ 3 game stretch of full starts, he also averaged more YPG, TD per game, and had a higher Comp %.#Eagles pic.twitter.com/mpF8OkEpb4— Eagles Nation (@PHLEaglesNation) August 23, 2021 Jalen Hurts has potential, but needs to utilize it early in 2021 Jalen Hurts is still just 23 with only four career starts, even though it may feel he\'s played more than that. A 1-3 record isn\'t great and neither is a 52% completion rate, 6 TDs, and four INTs. The upside is that he\'s shown he can lead, the offense respects him, and he\'s had 300+ yards in two of his four starts. He\'s played much better in training camp, but he really needed the reps in the preseason regardless of the Eagles wanting to rest him to prevent an injury. Jalen Hurts\' small amount of playing time in his career isn\'t large enough to really allow him to have a long leash as a starter and he will be under the microscope. While Gardner Minshew\'s arrival isn\'t a formal answer to Jalen Hurts losing his starting job, it does prove the Eagles feel they need to have suitable options on the depth chart.

4,Joe Flacco,"[""Is Joe Flacco still playing football?  Joe Flacco had one of the strongest arms in football, and he used that strong arm to constantly drag the Baltimore Ravens into the postseason. A divisive topic in the NFL has always been whether Joe Flacco is good, great, or overrated. Depending on your side, there are compelling arguments for your point.  Flacco has been a member of the NFL for longer than some casual fans have been watching, so it's no surprise that they can't remember how good he was, especially when his back was against the wall. Joe Flacco was a true mentality monster. He added grit, grind, and talent to every franchise he suited up for. That being said, there's a question here that we need to answer.        New York Jets@nyjetsJOE FLACCO BABY105801486JOE FLACCO BABY https://t.co/p3jfrUWMIn           Is Joe Flacco still playing football? Yes, Flacco is still playing football, and he was seen in Week 4 of the 2022 NFL season playing for the New York Jets. The Jets re-signed Flacco on a one-year deal to serve as the backup for their young quarterback, Zach Wilson.  When Wilson suffered an injury in Week 1 of the season, the Jets needed a seasoned vet to steady the ship. Queue in Flacco, who steadied the Jets pretty admirably.     So yes, Flacco is still playing football at the age of 37, which isn't that old considering his position as a quarterback. However, it's been five years since Flacco was an undisputed starter. You would have to rewind to his days as a Baltimore Raven (pre-Lamar Jackson) for when he was last a QB1. So maybe it's time to hang up the cleats, or maybe not. Joe Flacco has earned the right to make that decision. Action Network@ActionNetworkHQNFL Passing Yards Leaders1. Tua Tagovailoa: 7392. Carson Wentz: 6503.

Joe Flacco is playing backup to Zach Wilson because Jets coaches believe that Zach Wilson is their quarterback of the future. That's the reason they drafted him so high, and they are in the process of building a team that can compete around his skillset. Strong arm Joe had his time, as he has been in the league for almost two decades, playing in some of the best games in league history. Hence, Flacco is playing backup to Zach Wilson because his time as a starter in the NFL seems to have expired. However, new York Jets coach Robert Saleh still has faith in Flacco, and who knows? Maybe he'll win back the starting spot from the pocket-sized competitor with time. Robert Estes@BreakfastCarrotIke Taylor summarizing Joe Flacco will always be funny to me.

The man is Elite https://t.co/Sizk2K2LMP     Joe Flacco's fantasy performance His fantasy football performance over the past decade has been topsy-turvy. The reason is that he has barely started football games since the Baltimore Ravens drafted Lamar Jackson. It's such a shame, as prime Flacco would have been an actual beast in today's NFL. He has all the tools, stats, and grit to be a fantasy football league legend. However, we are in 2022, and Flacco is warming the bench for a young Jets QB named Zach Wilson.

In the 2017-2018 season, quarterbacks Josh McCown and Bryce Petty threw for a combined 60 yards versus the Denver Broncos in Week 14. All-time, the team has thrown for under 100 yards in 55 games.  Should Joe Flacco become the Jets starter for the rest of the season? While head coach Robert Saleh seems to be sticking with Zach Wilson, the numbers show that the team has played better under Joe Flacco. The former Baltimore Ravens star has started three games this season in place of Wilson. In those three games, Flacco threw for a combined 901 yards, five touchdowns and three interceptions. So far, Wilson has 1,279 yards, four touchdowns, and five interceptions. Joe Flacco also has a lot more experience starting games in this league with 179 career starts and 163 with the Ravens in 11 seasons.      When Jets rookie wide receiver Garrett Wilson was asked how bad the offense was in Week 11, he didn\'t hold back. Garrett Wilson said: ""This sh*t is not okay. Straight up, it is not okay,\'\' the first-round pick said. ""How many total yards did we have (103)? That shit is not going to fly. We got the dudes. It\'s time to be consistent. It\'s time to win the games we should win."" Wilson has thrown for under 200 yards passing in a game this season four times, including the loss versus the Patriots. He also hasn\'t thrown a touchdown in four of his last five starts, which was the case against the Patriots. In Week Nine against the Jets, the former BYU star had his lone game with a passer rating of over 100 (101.8 versus the Buffalo Bills).        The New York Jets are still in the playoff hunt with a 6 - 4 record this season and in third place in the AFC East. Will Salah replace Zach WIlson with Joe Flacco if Wilson continues to struggle?        The Jets drafted Wilson second overall in the 2021 NFL Draft.

He can help Hurts develop a great pocket presence in the NFL and offers both experience and success to the Philadelphia Eagles.     During the Baltimore Ravens playoff run, Joe Flacco put on a flawless performance in the four games. He threw for 1,140 passing yards and 11 touchdowns, but the stat that stands out the most is that Flacco didn\'t throw a single interception. Jalen Hurts was tossed to the sharks last season in Philadelphia. The Eagles were dealing with numerous issues around Carson Wentz, who was unhappy with head coach Doug Pederson, and it started to impact the team. Both Wentz and Pederson are gone and Jalen Hurts receives a fresh start. The starting quarterback job for the Philadelphia Eagles belongs to Jalen Hurts and only he can control his destiny now. If the Philadelphia Eagles bring in Nick Foles, it could impact Hurts\' confidence. After all, it wasn\'t too long ago that Nick Foles led the Eagles to a Super Bowl championship.If the Eagles bring in Joe Flacco to back up Jalen Hurts, they will be showing the young quarterback that they believe in him to lead their franchise. It\'ll be interesting to see how this all plays out in Philadelphia, but if the Eagles make the wrong move it could impact their future at quarterback.

Flacco led the Ravens to a 11-5 record and a playoff berth, where he managed to win two games. As the 6th seed, Flacco helped Baltimore win two road playoff games against the Dolphins and Titans. He threw for one touchdown and zero interceptions in both games. He proved to be an excellent game manager but crumbled in the AFC Championship game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Flacco was intercepted three times, losing 14-23. His excellent rookie season ended abruptly. #4 – Russell Wilson Detroit Lions v Seattle Seahawks     Many NFL fans were shocked when Russell Wilson was named the starter prior to his rookie year with the Seattle Seahawks. He was selected in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft. Seattle paid Matt Flynn handsomely that same offseason. But the decision was vindicated as Wilson led the Seahawks to the playoffs in his rookie campaign. Wilson and the Seahawks beat Washington in the Wild Card round, but narrowly lost out to the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional round. He impressed in his postseason debut as he passed for three touchdowns and had a 102.4 QB rating. Most surprising rookie performances in NFL playoff history #3 – Ben Roethlisberger Pittsburgh Steelers v New York Giants     Ben Roethlisberger had arguably the greatest rookie season for a QB in NFL history.

But it was Big Ben and the Pittsburgh Steelers who marched to a 13-0 start on their way to securing the 1st seed in the AFC. After their bye-week, Roethlisberger helped Pittsburgh beat the New York Jets 20-17. Big Ben threw a game-tying touchdown pass late in the game. The next week wasn’t quite so fruitful. Tom Brady and the Patriots beat them 41-27 to give them their first loss of the season. Roethlisberger still had two touchdown passes and threw for 226 yards.  #2 – Mark Sanchez Miami Dolphins v New York Jets     Much to the shock of the NFL world, Mark Sanchez made it to the playoffs in his debut campaign and was excellent. The New York Jets signal-caller overcame both the Cincinnati Bengals and San Diego Chargers on the road. The 5th seed Jets made it to the AFC Championship game. Despite leading at halftime, they would succumb to Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts. Even in defeat, Sanchez had an excellent game. He threw for two touchdowns. Sanchez finished the postseason with four passing touchdowns and only one interception. #1 – Brock Purdy NFC Divisional Playoffs - Dallas Cowboys v San Francisco 49ers     Brock Purdy was selected 256th overall in this year’s NFL draft. He is now just one game away from leading the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl. Purdy rose to the occasion following injuries to both Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo. He hasn’t looked out of place in the NFL, both in the regular season and postseason. Since taking over as the starter, Purdy has remained undefeated. He\'s won five regular-season games and a pair of playoff games. In his playoff debut, Purdy had three passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown in a blowout 41-23 win over the Seattle Seahawks. This was another record-breaking game for Purdy. His four touchdowns were the most by a rookie in the playoffs in league history. He also led them through a tough divisional game against the Dallas Cowboys. The 49ers will have their hands full against the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship game.

After Carson Wentz went down with injury, Foles took the Philadelphia Eagles all the way to the Super Bowl, where he outdueled Tom Brady for the Lombardi Trophy.  Both Foles and Wentz have since left the Philadelphia Eagles, and the team has now settled on Jalen Hurts as the team's long-term quarterback. The Eagles also signed veteran journeyman and former Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco to be the team's backup quarterback.        While Hurts is undoubtedly the team's starting quarterback, here's why the Philadelphia Eagles hope Joe Flacco could repeat what Nick Foles did during the 2017 season.           What made Nick Foles' Super Bowl win Nick Foles had an amazing start to his career with the Philadelphia Eagles. In his second season, he threw 27 touchdown passes with two interceptions. He slowed down after that, though, throwing just 13 touchdown passes with ten interceptions the next campaign. That led to his exit from the team. He landed with the St. Louis Rams and Kansas City Chiefs in the next two seasons before returning to the Philadelphia Eagles under a new coaching staff. In his first season as the backup for Carson Wentz, he led the team to a Super Bowl victory. in the span of 12 months, Nick Foles got...a $88M deal with Jacksonville & a $24M deal with Chicagohe was benched both places......then outplayed by both Mitch Trubisky & Gardner Minshewand is now buried as QB3 on the depth chart— Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) June 17, 2021     In other words, Nick Foles had a hot start to his career, hit a lull, became a backup for the Philadelphia Eagles after bouncing around and then won a Super Bowl. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Eagles hope Joe Flacco will follow a similar path. What could make Joe Flacco's next Super Bowl ring Like Nick Foles, Joe Flacco's career hit a peak relatively early. After only four years in the league, Joe Flacco ran through Peyton Manning and Tom Brady en route to a Super Bowl victory. After hitting an early peak, Joe Flacco's career entered a lukewarm period. After 2014, Flacco went on to play four more seasons but missed the playoffs each year. In 2018, the Baltimore Ravens made the playoffs after Joe Flacco's benching for Lamar Jackson.         After that, he bounced to two teams, the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets. Those were brief stints. Now, Joe Flacco has landed with the Philadelphia Eagles as a backup quarterback. Like Nick Foles behind a young Carson Wentz, Joe Flacco finds himself behind a young Jalen Hurts. Jalen Hurts Both Nick Foles and Joe Flacco have had hot starts to their respective careers. Both quarterbacks hit a lull before both of them landed with the Philadelphia Eagles after two one-season stints at other teams.Now, Joe Flacco is a backup for the Philadelphia Eagles behind a young quarterback. If their paths remain similar, the Philadelphia Eagles would hope that Joe Flacco is in line for a Super Bowl triumph in the very near future.     "", ""Tyler Conklin's fantasy outlook: Should you start the unpredictable New York Jets tight end?  Tyler Conklin is a tight end with the New York Jets. He performed admirably in Week 8's matchup with the New England Patriots. Conklin was targeted ten times while playing the majority of the day while trailing. In the defeat, he hauled in six catches for 79 yards and two touchdowns. This was his greatest performance since joining the team.  If you don't have Mark Andrews or Travis Kelce on your team, tight end is probably the toughest spot in fantasy football for you to find a regular producer. Conklin is worth a pickup in some leagues, even though he's expected to have some off days. Part of his problem is that the Jets utilize a run-heavy offense. For those trying to navigate injuries or bye weeks, Conklin is a reliable streaming option.        Harrison Glaser@NYJetsTFMediaTyler Conklin had his biggest game since being on the #Jets today 79 yards 13.2 yards per catch 2 TDs18Tyler Conklin had his biggest game since being on the #Jets today💥 79 yards💥 13.2 yards per catch💥 2 TDs https://t.co/QzZ1AnxdHs           Week 9's game against the Buffalo Bills will probably be a pass-heavy one, as the game-script is likely going to favor the Bills. Thus, Conklin could have another high-volume game. Considering the above, we recommend starting Tyler Conklin in Week 9. Tyler Conklin's season thus far New York Jets v Green Bay Packers     For Conklin, this season has been one of peaks and valleys. With Joe Flacco running the Jets' offense, he started the year by producing respectable fantasy numbers. However, Conklin's statistics have significantly decreased following Zach Wilson's return in Week 4. The tight end has caught 32 passes for 309 yards and three touchdowns this season. He has proven that when targeted he can deliver and deserves a greater number of looks than he normally receives. It will be interesting to see if quarterback Zach Wilson starts to utilize his tight end more as the season progresses.In a Week 9 matchup against the Buffalo Bills, the New York Jets will likely have to score a lot of points to stay in the game. Tyler Conklin should benefit if the Jets keep throwing the ball frequently in this upcoming game.     "", ""3 potential trade candidates for the Dallas Cowboys before the 2021 training camp  Free agency is largely wrapped up for the Dallas Cowboys. With draft business tidied up, the Cowboys will now head to training camp as they prep for the season.  While the Cowboys look like a decent outfit heading into pre-season, are there any holes to plug before they kick off Week 1?        Looking at the Cowboys' roster, the most glaring hole appears to be at backup quarterback. Garrett Gilbert has put in some interesting performances in the AAF, but the Cowboys need an NFL-caliber quarterback. Here are some options Jerry Jones and co could possibly explore before the start of the season.           Potential upgrades for the Dallas Cowboys #1 - Nick Mullens (Philadelphia Eagles) Nick Mullens is currently battling Joe Flacco to be the backup to Jalen Hurts. ESPN has Nick Mullens as the obvious third-string backup. However, most NFL teams only keep two quarterbacks on the roster. If the Philadelphia Eagles are already determined to go with Joe Flacco, Nick Mullens becomes the odd man out. Rather than cutting him outright, the Philadelphia Eagles could try and get something for him. That's where the Dallas Cowboys come in. Roster Move: #Eagles have agreed to terms with QB Nick Mullens. pic.twitter.com/HdaxAs3kEx— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) June 14, 2021     Nick Mullens is good to have around a 1:1 touchdown interception ratio, but his biggest plus point is that he is still pretty young in the NFL. He has only played in two seasons and could have more tricks up his sleeve given time and a stable atmosphere. #2 - Joe Flacco (Philadelphia Eagles) If the Philadelphia Eagles decide they want Nick Mullens over Joe Flacco, the latter becomes expendable. Flacco could be more expensive for the Dallas Cowboys to trade for, but if Dak Prescott gets injured again, Flacco would be a better option than Mullens. The Dallas Cowboys should be watching the position battle between Mullen and Flacco very closely.         It doesn't matter who wins, as both odd-man-out scenarios would result in more stability at backup quarterback in Dallas. If the Dallas Cowboys land Joe Flacco, they may be able to get him to heat up in the playoffs if the need arises. Flacco has a Super Bowl ring and, given the right circumstances, could rediscover his old self. #3 - Taylor Heinicke (Washington Football Team) If the Philadelphia Eagles are unwilling to do business with a division rival, the Dallas Cowboys could look towards the Washington Football Team. Washington will start Ryan Fitzpatrick at QB. Below him in the pecking order will be one of Kyle Allen or Taylor Heinicke. If Heinicke slips to No 3, the Dallas Cowboys will rest easy. Taylor Heinicke     Taylor Heinicke stepped into an impossible situation in 2020. Starting quarterback Alex Smith suffered his final football injury, leaving Heinicke to start his second game of the season in the Wild Card round of the NFL playoffs. With Tom Brady at the other end, many expected Washington to suffer the ignominy of a humbling. However, fans were treated to a solid game that was a lot closer than it needed to be. Taylor Heinicke threw the ball 44 times and put up 23 points in a 31-23 loss to the team that went on to win the Super Bowl. Taylor Heinicke's team did a much better job of standing up to the Buccaneers than the Kansas City Chiefs, who lost their matchup 31-9.Having put in a remarkable effort, Heinicke could be the man for the Dallas Cowboys.

Jets bench Zach Wilson and field fourth-string QB vs. Jaguars on TNF  Zach Wilson was benched in favor of Chris Streveler, following a disastrous performance during the first three quarters of the Jacksonville Jaguars vs New York Jets Thursday Night Football game.  Streveler is an undrafted quarterback out of South Dakota. He started his professional career in 2018 with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the CFL. Since 2020, he has also played for the Arizona Cardinals, the Baltimore Ravens and the Miami Dolphins.        Streveler signed with the New York Jets right before the 2022 training camp and put together a slew of great preseason performances. The team decided to release him during the final cuts, but he was signed to the practice squad.           With Mike White injured and out of the game, Streveler got the call-up from the practice squad. When Wilson was benched, Robert Saleh decided to give the quarterback a shot, instead of turning to veteran backup Joe Flacco. Chris Streveler career: Journeyman QB gets shot on primetime vs. Jaguars Jets fans in the stadium were really happy when Zach Wilson was benched. He had one of the worst quarterback performances of the season, completing just 50% of his passes for 92 yards and one interception. Preseason superstar Chris Streveler got a chance to showcase his talents in favor of Wilson. Streveler had already played in seven NFL games during his two years with the Arizona Cardinals but never started. Once he entered the field, there was a clear spark in New York's offense, with the journeyman quarterback completing more passes and adding with his runs.     Before entering the game for the Jets, Streveler had thrown just 25 passes in his NFL career, completing 17 of them for 141 yards, a touchdown and an interception. He's 27 years old. No matter how good Chris Streveler plays against the Jaguars, the fact that Zach Wilson was benched basically ends his Jets career, as harsh as it seems. The former second-overall pick will not start a game as long as Mike White is healthy, and he's probably not starting a game again in 2022.After two awful years with the Jets, it's impossible to believe he will be back in 2023, no matter how much they invested in him.     "", 'carson wentz: 5 NFL QBs who could be out of the league after 2023 feat. Carson Wentz  Ultimately, an NFL quarterback’s success is measured by the number of wins he has throughout his career. Victories are even more impressive if they happen while missing a star wide receiver, running back, or offensive lineman.   The best quarterbacks find ways to will their squad to triumph, even if they are not at full strength. That leadership gives confidence to everyone in the huddle, motivating them to excel.        Getting more wins can lead to playoff appearances, conference championship games, and Super Bowl titles. The quarterbacks on this list have made it to those games, but with varying results. At some point, however, the wins trickled, if not stopped. Be it Father Time or something else, these players are no longer dependable signal callers.           Here are the quarterbacks who might have played their last snap during the 2022 NFL season. The possibility of getting another contract is dwindling as their recent performances indicate it’s time to go. They’ve had their time, but the game will move on without them in pads and uniforms. Which 5 NFL quarterbacks could be out of the league in ahead of the 2023 season? 5. Joe Flacco Baltimore Ravens fans were surprised when Joe Flacco became the 18th overall selection in the 2008 NFL Draft. Aside from playing for a small school, Flacco even asked his coach to play baseball because he was not confident about his prospects. But the University of Delaware alumnus brought stability to a position where the Ravens struggled to find long-term solutions.

IT. BACK.Joe Flacco is Elite.Time for One Last Ride. 🏆 https://t.co/MgWaLNPoYL He became the team’s starting quarterback for 11 seasons, winning Super Bowl XLVII and taking MVP honors. But since then, he has bounced around the league, suiting up for the Denver Broncos, Philadelphia Eagles, and New York Jets (twice). He took over from Zach Wilson in five games in the 2022 season but won only one game. There are better options at quarterback than the 38-year-old Flacco. 4. Josh Johnson NFC Championship - San Francisco 49ers v Philadelphia Eagles     Josh Johnson was also selected in the 2008 draft, 142 spots after Flacco. He’s a journeyman who has suited up for 14 NFL teams in 15 seasons. He also played for the Los Angeles Wildcats for one XFL season. Johnson had his fourth stint with the San Francisco 49ers in 2022 and played two games.  He played in the NFC Championship Game after Brock Purdy suffered an injury but was also checked out due to a concussion. SportsCenter@SportsCenterBrock Purdy is back in at QB for the 49ers after this hit on Josh Johnson.2906134Brock Purdy is back in at QB for the 49ers after this hit on Josh Johnson. https://t.co/hxZqKr4pBk He finished the game with seven completions for 74 yards. Johnson also appeared in two regular-season games but had only one completion and three rushing yards. Seeing him get another opportunity is challenging, given that he is already 36. Likewise, the 49ers signed Sam Darnold to compete with Purdy and Trey Lance.     3. Chase Daniel Los Angeles Chargers v Arizona Cardinals Chase Daniel was a highly-touted quarterback coming out of college after throwing for 12,515 yards and 101 touchdowns as a University of Missouri starter. Unfortunately, the two-time Heisman Trophy finalist went undrafted in 2009. Daniel eventually joined the New Orleans Saints after spending time in the Washington Commanders\' practice squad.

Aside from winning Super Bowl XLIV with the Saints, Chase Daniel also has estimated career earnings of $41 million. He appeared in four games for the Los Angeles Chargers last season, throwing for 52 yards and a touchdown. But with Easton Stick being Justin Herbert\'s backup, Daniel might have seen the end of his playing career. 2. Matt Ryan Houston Texans v Indianapolis Colts Despite his release in March, the 2016 NFL Most Valuable Player will still get $12 million from the Indianapolis Colts. Credit his agent, Tom Condon, for negotiating that caveat into his contract. While he will still receive financial rewards, Matt Ryan faltered in his attempt to lead the Colts to the playoffs.      He has only won four of the 12 regular-season games he started, finishing with 14 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Barstool Indy@barstoolindyThe Matt Ryan Era in Indy is officially over.

Aside from being a league MVP, he was an Offensive Player of the Year and Offensive Rookie of the Year awardee. Ryan also has one All-Pro distinction and four Pro Bowl selections. He must accept a backup role to keep getting game checks.     1. Carson Wentz Cleveland Browns v Washington Commanders Ironically, Wentz was the Colts’ starting quarterback before Ryan. The Commanders traded for him, hoping to get a quarterback who showed more promise earlier in his NFL career. But he ended up starting seven games, winning only two. Head coach Ron Rivera named him the starter in their must-win Week 17 match against the Cleveland Browns. Sadly, he played poorly, putting Washington out of playoff contention. Moody@EricNMoody“Washington released QB Carson Wentz.”The Commanders see big things for Sam Howell.Carson Wentz right now:39351“Washington released QB Carson Wentz.”The Commanders see big things for Sam Howell.Carson Wentz right now:https://t.co/mesxpfnqmz The Commanders had seen enough and released Wentz after the 2022 NFL season. After failing in two opportunities as a starting quarterback, he would have to take a significant salary cut if he wanted to keep playing. But getting another contract isn’t up to him because it looks like he has given everything he can as a player. He’d be lucky if an NFL team came calling, considering his recent struggles.     ', 'Why was Zach Wilson benched? What did he say in the Week 11 postgame conference?  Zach Wilson was the starting quarterback for the New York Jets for seven games this season. He led the team to five wins, including a Week 9, 20-17 win against the Buffalo Bills. Under his leadership, the Jets lost two games, both of which were against the New England Patriots.  Wilson had a poor performance in the Week 11 defeat to their AFC East rival, and followed it up with a disastrous press conference. As a result, head coach Robert Saleh announced he was benching Wilson in favor of Mike White.        Wilson was roundly criticized for his refusal to take accountability for a poor offensive display, while the Jets defense limited the Patriots to three points all game. New England won the game 10-3 in the final seconds on a punt return touchdown.           In the postgame interview, a reporter asked Wilson if he felt he had let the defense down. His response was simple: ""No."" Watch the video below, as it was as much his body language as what he said:         So was it entirely that comment that led to his benching, or was there more to the story? Zach Wilson\'s 2022 NFL season stats and Week 12 performance Zach Wilson - New York Jets v Carolina Panthers The Jets have been impressive this season, but Wilson can\'t take too much credit for their change in fortunes. Although they were winning games, they were looking stagnant on offense and some of the issues had to be shouldered by Zach Wilson. It\'s important to note that a season-ending injury to Breece Hall was a major factor in their offensive downturn, but Wilson really didn\'t help himself either.     The Jets entered the regular season with Joe Flacco under center as Wilson suffered a knee injury in the preseason matchup with the Philadelphia Eagles. Flacco went 1-2 before Wilson was ready to play against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 4. Wilson brought the Jets into the limelight as they won their next four games. However, in Week 8, the Patriots defeated the Jets 22-17. Zach Wilson completed only 20 of the 41 passes he attempted. He threw for 355 yards and had two touchdown passes and three interceptions. Those turnovers proved too much for the Jets to overcome.        Following a narrow win over the Buffalo Bills and a bye week, the Jets fell to a disappointing 3-10 loss against the Patriots in Week 11. Wilson completed 9 of 22 passes for 77 yards and the offense gained just two yards after halftime. It was the worst performance of his career and this, along with his postgame comments, caused him to be benched for Week 12 against the Chicago Bears. You might also like - When can college football players go to the NFL? This season, Zach Wilson has thrown for 1,279 yards, four touchdowns and five interceptions. As the Jets believe they can compete with the best of teams this year, they felt a change was required to push them forward. Zach Wilson apologized for his Week 11 comments Wilson later apologized for his comments, saying: “I wanted the opportunity to talk to those guys, really make it from the heart... It\'s deserved (the criticism), the way that I handled the situation wasn\'t right and I\'ve got to be a better football player and I\'ve got to be a better leader for these guys...""         Wilson spoke to the entire team on Wednesday, admitting his poor performance in the game. He also said that he is not here to play as a backup quarterback and will do whatever he can to re-claim the starting job for the team. Meanwhile, Mike White started Sunday\'s game against the Chicago Bears and led the team to a 31-10 victory. White impressed everyone with his game by completing 22 of 28 for 315 yards and throwing three touchdown passes.     The question remains as to whether the will Jets give Zach Wilson another chance to prove himself.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Newyorkjets.com and H/T Sportskeeda.     ']"

"", ""What is the single game NFL passing yards record?  Joe Burrow's eye-popping stat line from his game against the Baltimore Ravens got people talking about the single-game NFL passing yards record. In the game, Joe Burrow completed 80.4 percent of his passes for 525 yards, four touchdowns and zero interceptions.  He completed 37 of 46 pass attempts to lead the Bengals to a 41-21 beatdown of the Baltimore Ravens in a performance that put the Bengals squarely in first place in the AFC North. It was an awe-inspiring NFL performance, but where does it land among the greatest NFL performances of all time? Here's a look at the record, as well as a feel for where Burrow's performance lands him on the list.        NFL record for passing yards in a game           Pittsburgh Steelers v Cincinnati Bengals The highest number of passing yards in an NFL game came in 1951, thanks to a performance by Norm Van Brocklin. Playing for the Los Angeles Rams, he threw for 554 yards en route to a victory over the New York Yanks, according to NBC Chicago. Van Brocklin played from 1949 to 1960. In his career, he threw for 173 touchdowns and 178 interceptions. There are a number of surprises about this. The first surprise is that a passing game from 1951 still holds the record for passing yardage in the NFL 70 years later. The second surprise is that, for all of the talk about how the passing game has advanced through the years, one of the biggest NFL passing records comes from a time when running the ball was preferable to passing it.

Dak Prescott, 2020: 502     "", 'San Diego Chargers: Still in the Playoff hunt  Ryan Mathews was outstanding for the San Diego Chargers, putting up 127 yards on 29 carries.  Before I write this article, I would like to lament the death of my fantasy football team, which featured Bronco’s QB Peyton Manning and RBs Knowshon Moreno and Montee Ball. It was the championship game and you guys rushed for a combined 18 yards! Should I fail to win the ‘ship, which looks highly probable right now, I will always hate the San Diego Chargers for their outstanding performance on Thursday Night Football.        Now that I’ve put in my obligatory fantasy football whine, lets get down to business. An inspired performance by the San Diego Chargers saw them beat the 11-2 (now 11-3) Denver Broncos 27-20 away in Colorado! The Broncos struck first in the opening quarter, with Peyton Manning going 4/5 before hitting Andre Caldwell for the 15-yard touchdown. Manning cut the Chargers’ defense open with methodical passes, much like he has been doing all year. But then, something changed. After a Nick Novak field goal to get the Chargers’ on the board, San Diego’s defense forced three straight three-and-outs from the league’s most explosive offense. Poor pass protection and good coverage by the Chargers’ allowed their own QB, Philip Rivers, to control the game and spend more time on the field. The Chargers offense was on the field for close to 39 minutes, with the Broncos barely eclipsing 21. The Chargers’ ended the first half with a convincing 17-10 lead, thanks to rookie WR Keenan Allen, who likely wrapped up the Offensive Rookie of the Year award with his performance Thursday night.               In the second half, no much changed. Manning and the Broncos offense continued to struggle and the Broncos’ defense couldn’t make any plays. Manning also threw a costly interception and Denver couldn’t get any production out of their running game. The Broncos rushed for 18 yards the entire game! Knowshon Moreno and Montee Ball were absolutely unable to find any running room, which likely put additional pressure on Manning to throw contested passes. The Chargers extended the lead to 24-10 on RB Ryan Mathews 35-yard run in the third quarter. To top off Denver’s bad night, the Broncos committed two huge penalties that cost the Broncos seven potential minutes on the field. Manning was able to find Caldwell in the fourth for another touchdown, but the slow pace in which Rivers moved the Chargers’ offense left little time on the clock for Manning to operate. He got the ball with five minutes left in the game and was able to get a Matt Prater field goal to bring the deficit to 7, but the ensuing onside kick didn’t reach the required 10 yards and Rivers ended the game by taking a knee. Here are a couple points of emphasis on the night:     Ryan Mathews. Mathews has taken a lot of flak over the years for his inability to stay healthy. While his health may be of concern, his talent certainly isn’t. Mathews shredded the Denvers defense with 29 carried for 127 yards. Mathews was able to get a few crucial first downs, including converting a couple of 3 and 1?s with some great second effort attempts. Mathews has really impressed San Diego with his performance during the second half of this season. He’s shown some great vision on the field and has run effectively. The Chargers didn’t really have to use back-up back Danny Woodhead as much as they normally do, with Woodhead only recording nine carries. Peyton Manning was under heavy pressure from an inspired San Diego defense all night.     San Diego’s Defense. With Wes Welker sidelined with concussion-like symptoms, the Chargers focused on shutting down DeMaryius Thomas, Eric Decker, and Julius Thomas, the Broncos’ most potent weapons without Welker. The result? Thomas, Decker, and Thomas recorded less than 140 yards receiving. Total. Peyton was forced to throw to seldom-used fourth-string WR Caldwell, with the result being two trips to the endzone for the Florida product. The Chargers also effectively stopped Denvers’ backs from gaining on the traction on the ground, holding Moreno to 19 yards rushing and Ball to -1. They were able to clog the running lanes, with Moreno’s longest run only six yards. They also batted down two of Mannings’ passes (the most any team has been able to do all year) and sacked him on two crucial third downs. This inspired defense will remain crucial if the Chargers hope to make the playoffs. The loss to the Chargers makes Denvers’ chances of grasping home-field advantage throughout the playoffs unlikely. The New England Patriots will have to lose one of their next three games and the Broncos will have to win their remaining match-ups with the Houston Texans and the Oakland Raiders. This loss also means that Denver will be unable to rest it’s stars before the playoffs as they have to win every game to seize home-field advantage. Should the Broncos have won, they would only have to beat the Texans, rendering their match-up with the Raiders meaningless and affording Manning some much-needed rest before the playoffs. On the other hand, the Chargers keep their playoffs hopes alive. They stand at 7-7, a record that is still unlikely to make the postseason. San Diegos’ main competitors for the last remaining playoff spot in the AFC are the Miami Dolphins and Baltimore Ravens, with both teams owning the tiebreaker in their respective match-up. The Chargers will have to win their last two games and hope the Dolphins and Ravens go 1-2 or 0-3, unlikely scenarios given the quality of the opponents they still have to play. Still, the convincing win over the Broncos should boost their confidence in knowing that they can be a great team if they play consistenly well.     ', ""Top 5 most overrated QBs in NFL history  Quarterbacks are so important that any half-decent player can become an overrated QB if the franchise they are playing for has had no luck in that position. Teams spend years, lots of money and draft capital to get the right quarterbacks, and if they are slightly better than the previous incumbents, the teams proclaim them to be the very best. Over the years, we have seen some good quarterbacks who might fall into the category of overrated QBs on closer inspection of their performances. Here are some we believe to fall into that category.  Overrated QBs over the years in the NFL        #5 - Tony Romo           Tony Romo's story and the franchise he played for made it special. Any player playing for the Dallas Cowboys automatically garners attention because they are, after all, the richest franchise also known as America's Team. His personal story is also perfect. He went undrafted in the NFL and then made it as the quarterback of the biggest franchise of them all. theScore@theScoreIs Tony Romo a HOF'er? 🧐858Is Tony Romo a HOF'er? 🧐 https://t.co/mA46WiriPA However, what makes him an overrated QB is that, even though he played with the Cowboys for so long, he ended up with a losing 2-4 record in the playoffs. He never even once made it to the Super Bowl, and that just does not merit the hype he got as the face of the Cowboys franchise.     #4 - Dan Fouts Dan Fouts was one of the best quarterbacks the San Diego Chargers ever had. But by no means was he all that he was made out to be. His quarterback rating was just 80.2 and his completion rate was just 59%. He had just 12 more touchdowns than his interceptions. Andrew Mason@MaseDenverIn 33 of their seasons, the Chargers had Dan Fouts, Drew Brees, Philip Rivers or Justin Herbert as their primary starting QB.They missed the playoffs in 22 of those years. And in none of those did they make it to the Super Bowl. (Their 1 SB appearance was with Stan Humphries.)36648In 33 of their seasons, the Chargers had Dan Fouts, Drew Brees, Philip Rivers or Justin Herbert as their primary starting QB.They missed the playoffs in 22 of those years. And in none of those did they make it to the Super Bowl. (Their 1 SB appearance was with Stan Humphries.) In the postseason, his performances made for even worse reading. He made it to the playoffs only four times and lost three times. During that time, he threw for 12 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. That included two games with five interceptions in a game. His quarterback rating was just 70.0 in those games. Even though he went to six Pro Bowls and is a Hall of Famer, he is definitely an overrated QB in our opinion.     #3 - Archie Manning The patriarch of the Manning family, Archie Manning, made it to two Pro Bowls, but his is more famous because of his sons, Peyton and Eli Manning. His record in the NFL is the worst for any quarterback with, at least, 100 starts at 35-101-3. He certainly was not helped by a weak New Orleans team that could not provide him any protection. But even when he got the ball away, it seemed to land an awful lot more with the opposition players than it did with his own team members. He threw for 173 interceptions and just 125 touchdowns. That is nearly one and a half times the interception as compared to touchdowns. His quarterback rating was a paltry 67.1. His sons' achievements have elevated him, but judged purely based on his skills alone, he was an overrated QB. #2 - Terry Bradshaw Terry Bradshaw might seem the weirdest pick on this list given he won four Super Bowls in six seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. However, those teams were not dependent on the quarterback because they had talent on both sides of the ball. One of the Super Bowls he won in a season had just seven touchdowns and eight interceptions. Such was the talent of the team that his weaknesses were well hidden.        Over his career, he had 212 touchdowns but 210 interceptions; hardly the hallmark of a great quarterback. He threw more than 20 interceptions five times in his career. His career is undoubtedly impressive, but in no way did he warrant a legendary status. Very much an overrated QB in our book. #1 - Joe Namath Joe Namath is a a legend for the New York Jets. He famously proclaimed that, in Super Bowl III, the upstarts from the American Football League would defeat the Baltimore Colts of the National Football League. But his performance in the game was nothing to shout about, even though he was given MVP honors. In the 16-7 scoreline, he did not have a single touchdown.       Over his career, he went 62-63. His quarterback rating was just 65.5, and he threw 220 interceptions as compared to 173 touchdowns. Numbers such as these do not scream legend at us, and that is why he makes the list as an overrated QB.     "", ""NFL Trade Rumors: Indianapolis Colts looking for a starting QB next season?  The Indianapolis Colts don't need a quarterback right now.  The Colts, who go into Thursday night's game with the AFC South-leading Tennessee Titans at 5-3 and very much in the playoff picture, actually have a borderline future Hall of Famer lining up at the position right now. Paired with the NFL's top-ranked defense in terms of total yards allowed, QB Philip Rivers has the Indianapolis Colts in a good spot currently.        But there is the future to consider. Rivers is 38 years old and he joined the Indianapolis Colts this season on a one-year contract after spending 16 years with the Los Angeles Chargers.           Philip Rivers needs only four passing yards to surpass Dan Marino on the all-time passing yards list. #ForTheShoe📺: #INDvsTEN – 8pm ET on NFLN/FOX/PRIME VIDEO📱: https://t.co/W5bCPYgMfo pic.twitter.com/1KI31HfU19— NFL (@NFL) November 13, 2020 After this season, Rivers might want to retire. He might want to play somewhere else. Or the Indianapolis Colts might just want to move on and not tie their hopes to a QB who's knocking on 40 years old. Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer wrote about the Indianapolis Colts' options at QB next season and brought up two names that could be trade possibilities: Sam Darnold of the New York Jets and Jimmy Garoppolo of the San Francisco 49ers.     NFL Trade Rumors: Darnold or Garoppolo headed to the Indianapolis Colts? Darnold and Jimmy G have been the subjects of a lot of trade rumors before and after the league's Nov. 3 trade deadline. Darnold was supposed to be the Jets' franchise QB, taken with the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, but he hasn't panned out and the Jets are terrible. They're bad enough to be in pole position for the No. 1 pick in the 2021 draft, and if they get that spot, they're most likely going to take Clemson QB Trevor Lawrence. In that case, Darnold becomes expendable. Darnold has some talent and he's young (23), he just doesn't have much help with the Jets. With the Colts, he'd be helped by a very good defense and some playmakers at running back and receiver. Garoppolo is technically the 49ers' franchise QB -- at least that's how he was billed when he came over from the New England Patriots after an apprenticeship as Tom Brady's backup -- but at this point he's become seen as more of a game manager. Garoppolo has been injury-prone (he's sidelined right now with a high ankle sprain), and the San Francisco defense and run game gets more credit for leading the team to the Super Bowl last season.     I’m sitting here wondering how it’s possible for 49ers fans to be so ungrateful for Garoppolo who took us to a Super Bowl......and then I remember that Patriots fans literally booed Tom Brady out of Gillette Stadium for a poor performance AFTER he won them 6 Super Bowls. 😅 Smh— Lydia (@limajuliettango) November 3, 2020 With the Colts, Garoppolo might only need to be a game manager with that defense and the offensive talent around him. In the event the Indianapolis Colts want to bring back Rivers and he wants to stay, they won't need an immediate-impact QB and could instead find their eventual replacement in the draft.The Indianapolis Colts will likely be picking somewhere in the mid- to late-first round, putting them in range for some high-quality quarterbacks like Florida's Kyle Trask or Alabama's Mac Jones.

"", ""3 players who could have a down-year in 2022 NFL season  The NFL season is always full of surprises. There are many examples of unexpected occurrences. An undrafted rookie that comes out of nowhere to bolster a team's rushing attack, the third-string quarterback who is forced into action on Monday Night Football and leads his team to victory.   With player movement at an all-time high and the continued dependence on younger players, making predictions about which players will have successful seasons gets harder.        Examining the NFL offseason and thinking about which players might have a down year is a bit easier. Teams are always willing to spotlight players who are going to step up and fill roster holes, but the reality is those players rarely reach the promises of training camp.           For a lot of the NFL's elite, the downward spiral can be quick and sudden. Think about Philip Rivers' time with the Indianapolis Colts. Rivers went from being a franchise stalworth with the Chargers to the potential answer to the Colts' quarterback woes.  The problem was that Rivers could never recapture his form and while he was more than serviceable, he was not a guy who was going to lead his team to the Supe Bowl. NFL on CBS 🏈@NFLonCBSNOBODY was better when wearing a mic than Philip Rivers via @NFLFilms 872112NOBODY was better when wearing a mic than Philip Rivers 😂via @NFLFilms https://t.co/mZdMwGAC7z     Whether it is due to retirement, contract situations, age, trades or free agent signings, there are high-profile players whose stature in the league could be on the decline. Here are three NFL players who could have a down year in the 2022 season.  Ezekiel Elliot, RB, Dallas Cowboys Ezekiel Elliot has defied the predictions of NFL analysts for a long time People have been predicting the downfall of Ezekiel Elliot for years, and yet the soon to be 27-year-old continues to be a productive running back in the league. The 2022 season could be the beginning of the end though.      Elliot is reaching the age where running backs not named Derrick Henry begin to decline. The Cowboys offensive line does not have the overwhelming strength that it had when Elliot was running all over the league.  Lastly, back-up running back Tony Pollard went from showing flashes of brilliance to legitimate proof that he should, at the very least, be splitting carries with Elliot. Dan Rogers@DannyPhantom24Tony Pollard has 11 career NFL touchdowns.He's had 11 games with more than 10 carries.The Cowboys are 11-0 in those games.977Tony Pollard has 11 career NFL touchdowns.He's had 11 games with more than 10 carries.The Cowboys are 11-0 in those games. https://t.co/mPyCjUUZiP  Kyler Murray, QB, Arizona Cardinals Kyler Murray might see a drop in his NFL performances despite a good last season     At 24 years old, Kyler Murray should be entering the prime of NFL career. The Arizona Cardinals are coming off a playoff appearance and Murray had an outstanding year, throwing for over 3,700 yards and running for over 400.  However, things in Arizona are not quite as comfortable as one would think. Murray and the Cardinals seemed to be at a contract negotiation impasse as he outwardly questioned his role with the franchise moving forward.  The Cardinals traded for his close friend and former college teammate, Hollywood Brown, but he needs to prove that he can consistently stay on the field. Adding to Murray's woes is DeAndre Hopkins' recent suspension.         Matthew Stafford, QB, Los Angeles Rams Matthew Stafford was Rams' key player in 2021 Matthew Stafford led the Los Angeles Rams to the Super Bowl in 2021 and proved all of his doubters wrong. Stafford and Rams were so productive throughout the 2021 NFL season that the reality is, there is probably nowhere to go but down.  For much of his career, Stafford was criticized as a guy who could put up stats but not win when it mattered. That definitely changed in a driven 2021 season. How is it possible for Stafford and the Rams to keep that level of motivation going?      On the field, Stafford saw Andrew Whitfield retire, leaving a hole at left tackle. With Stafford and Rams' missions clearly accomplished, it will be difficult for them to want it as badly in 2022 as they did last season.       ""]"

Ryan Fitzpatrick might be the smartest quarterback to step foot on the Gridiron, which does not discredit his peers, predecessors, and successors in the league.

Fitzpatrick earned a reputation around the league as a journeyman quarterback. He might have started in just about every franchise he played for, but he hardly spent more than a few years at any. As such, he played football in eight cities, and he proceeded to have seven kids during the span of his career.     Each of Fitzpatrick's kids was born in a different city. He and his lovely spouse have three sons and four daughters together. The children go by the names Brady, 12; Tate, 10; Lucy, 8; Maizy, 6; Zoey, 4; Ruby, 2; and Jake, 1. It remains to be seen whether Fitzpatrick and his partner, Liza Barber Fitzpatrick, have more children.

NFL Free Agency: Signing Ryan Fitzpatrick keeps Washington Football Team as contenders in the NFC East There\'s no question that Washington fans should doubt Ryan Fitzpatrick\'s age and performance deterioration since entering the NFL in 2005, but he was likely the best free-agent QB left on the market and did not require the team to give up so much in a trade. Known as ""Fitzmagic"" around the league by fans, he has spent his time with eight different teams in the league after being drafted by the then St. Louis Rams in 2005. The 38-year-old QB has played for the Cincinnati Bengals, Buffalo Bills, Tennessee Titans, Houston Texans, New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Miami Dolphins.     In the 2020 NFL regular season, Fitzpatrick played in 9 games and started in 7 games, before rookie QB Tua Tagoviloa was named the starting QB in Week 8. In those 9 games, Fitzpatrick completed 183 of 267 passes for 2,091 yards with 13 touchdowns and 8 interceptions.

GM Martin Mayhew and OC Scott Turner attended Trey Lance\'s pro day and he could be one of few QB\'s that may fall to the 19th position in the upcoming NFL draft.Either way Ryan Fitzpatrick is not the long-term solution and the organization is looking at each season one by one, considering they can keep that stellar defense for only so long. Washington Football Team will still be an NFC playoff contender this coming season and fans should be excited.     ', 'Tom Brady vs Ryan Fitzpatrick beef: Retracing infamous feud between ex-NFL QBs  The feud between quarterbacks Tom Brady and Ryan Fitzpatrick is bizarre.  It’s easier to comprehend the bad blood between Brady and Peyton Manning because they were equal rivals during their prime. However, their rivalry was purely performance-based, and they had the utmost respect for each other.        Apparently, Brady did not go along with Fitzpatrick, a quarterback who played for nine NFL teams in 17 seasons. Likewise, Fitzpatrick defeated Brady only three times in 14 meetings. No wonder some football fans claim the tension between them was a publicity stunt.           But before jumping to a conclusion, it’s best to reminisce about the incidents that provoked a rift between the two play-callers with lengthy careers. When did the Tom Brady-Ryan Fitzpatrick beef start? Brady reminisced about his 2020 free agency journey in a 2021 episode of HBO’s “The Shop: Uninterrupted.” Teams reached out to him because he was already a six-time Super Bowl winner, with the most recent one happening in 2018. When the conversation went to the teams who were not interested at the very end, Brady revealed his thoughts by saying: “You’re sticking with that m*th*rf*cker. Are you serious?”        Fitzpatrick felt he was being referred to because the Miami Dolphins (his team back then) reached out to the Michigan alumnus. The Harvard graduate was penciled in as the Dolphins’ starting quarterback unless Brady joined them. Eventually, Tom Brady joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and won his seventh Super Bowl title. Meanwhile, the Dolphins drafted Tua Tagovailoa with the fifth overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft. Despite Tagovailoa’s arrival, Fitzpatrick started seven games that year and unleashed his “Fitzmagic” to save some games in the fourth quarter.     Further investigation revealed that Dolphins vice chairman Bruce Beal had contacted Brady as early as August 2019. It violated the league’s anti-tampering policy, as Brady was still under contract with New England. That case and the Dolphins’ communication with coach Sean Payton led to the forfeiture of their 2023 first-round pick. Ryan Fitzpatrick says one thing, Tom Brady says another A year later, Fitzpatrick still couldn’t ignore Tom Brady’s alleged comment about him. That’s why he was still irked about the three-time NFL MVP during his September 2022 guesting in Barstool Sports’ ""Pardon My Take"" podcast. When PFT Commenter suggested that Brady was referring to Derek Carr in the infamous quote, Fitzpatrick reacted: “No, it had to be me.” But when Dan “Big Cat” Katz suggested that Tom Brady had the utmost respect for him, Fitzpatrick answered: “No, zero respect. He never shaked my hand. I’ve told this story before, but it just p*sses me off because you’re in Buffalo, you’re playing them in there, and they’re kicking our a*s every single year. They’re beating us.     “And then, in 2011, we finally knocked them off. It was right at the beginning of the season, we had like this great start, and he threw five interceptions in the game, which was just wonderful to see, every single one of them. ""And he ran straight off with no handshake, you know quarterback, middle of the field, for the cameras, ‘Stay healthy, buddy’, you know. Pat me on the head and let me go. “But he just ran straight off. So, it bothered me so much because there was no respect there. So it was like, every time I played him after that, I was like, ‘All right, let’s at least make this dude respect me.’”        Not long after, Tom Brady responded to Fitzpatrick’s statements on the ""Let’s Go! Podcast"" hosted by himself, Larry Fitzgerald, and Jim Gray. Brady said: “I like to keep them guessing. Unfortunately, with this coming out, I’d have to tell him it wasn’t him. I love Ryan, but somehow, he’s got it out for me. ""I actually talked to Ryan Griffin, who’s one of our quarterbacks (on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers), and he said, ‘Ryan’s always all over you. I don’t know why.’ So, I don’t know why Ryan is. Maybe Ryan and I need to have a talk.     “Ryan’s a hell of a guy too, and I’ve competed against him. He’s a Harvard guy, now he looks like he’s part homeless, and now he’s on TV, doing [what] my future job’s gonna be. I think Ryan’s got a good thing going. I’m not sure why he needs to think I’m after him.”        All’s well that ends well for Tom Brady and Ryan Fitzpatrick? Tom Brady and Ryan Fitzpatrick met at Raymond James Stadium during the Buccaneers’ 2022 Week 8 game against the Baltimore Ravens. Fitzpatrick was a part of Amazon’s Thursday Night Football broadcasting crew, while Brady was playing in his 23rd NFL season and third with Tampa Bay. However, it felt like they had buried the hatchet when they had a pre-game chat with Richard Sherman. Brady and Fitzpatrick shook hands while sharing a good laugh.

', ""NFL: Backup quarterbacks who could be starters next season  While most teams look for answers at the quarterback position via the draft, there are a handful of quarterbacks currently carrying clipboards that may find themselves (back) under center in Week 1 of the 2021 NFL season.   They could be desperate attempts to help revive a win-now franchise, or could be placeholders for young rookies drafted in April. Whatever the case may be, there are always a handful of teams looking for a steadying presence in the locker room and in the field, and sometimes that can be found by plucking someone away from a different roster.        Let’s take a closer look at current backup quarterbacks who have a good chance to be a starter to begin next season.            Ryan Fitzpatrick In hindsight, it turned out that Miami Dolphins rookie quarterbackTua Tagovailoa was probably not inserted into the starting lineup too soon, as the team has continued its playoff push behind the prized Alabama prospect. But there’s no denying that veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick showed he had a lot left in the tank earlier in the season, and filled in admirably in a spot start against the New York Jets in Week 12. In addition to his ability to give the offense a spark, the 38 year old is also highly regarded as one of the best leaders and teammates in the NFL. As the Dolphins will likely officially hand the keys to Tagovailoa for the 2021 season, Fitzpatrick might be seeking other opportunities to start, even if it’s just as a placeholder for a young quarterback.     Possible Opportunities To Start: Jacksonville Jaguars, Indianapolis Colts, Washington Football Team, Minnesota Vikings, Chicago Bears 350 passing yards. Three Touchdowns.The best throws from Ryan Fitzpatrick's Week 5 performance!@MiamiDolphins | #FinsUp pic.twitter.com/Pr3xMmLzeK— NFL (@NFL) October 13, 2020  Jacoby Brissett While it’s apparent that the Indianapolis Colts don’t view Brissett as a viable starting option that can get the team into the postseason, he has made a few cameo appearances this season in special scenarios. When the Colts have been in a goal to go or short yardage situations, they’ve brought solidly built Brissett (6’4” 238 pounds) to execute quarterback sneaks. Additionally, when Indianapolis have been in Hail Mary situations, they’ve opted to let him be the quarterback that fires the ball 50-60 yards in the air, instead of starter Philip Rivers.     There’s more to playing quarterback than just the physical demands of the position, but it’s better to have some physical talent as a starting point and improve in the other areas than the other way around. Still just 28 years old, Brissett has already started 32 games at quarterback in the NFL, and teams could do worse than someone who has the ability to challenge secondaries down the field and punch in one yard touchdowns. Possible Opportunities To Start: New England Patriots, Pittsburgh Steelers(if Ben Roethlisberger retires), Detroit Lions Not your average QB sneak by Jacoby Brissett 😮 @JBrissett12 @Colts 📺 #GBvsIND on FOX pic.twitter.com/HslBye13Br— The Checkdown (@thecheckdown) November 22, 2020      Carson Wentz After having received multiple opportunities to turn his season around, the Philadelphia Eagles finally decided that they could no longer press on with Carson Wentz at quarterback. Each game looked worse than the next, and Jalen Hurts’ early returns have been everything fans would want to see from a modern day NFL quarterback. Unless Hurts hits a rookie wall soon, it would be difficult for Eagles management to defend a return to Wentz under center. Wentz’s contract is massive and would not be desirable to take on unless a team really felt like they could turn his fortunes around. He’s only 27 years old, and could still very well bounce back to the form he had in 2017 when he was 11-2 as a starting quarterback, but that seems like decades ago in NFL timelines. Still, one would think he would get at least one or two other chances to start elsewhere if Philadelphia decided to go in a different direction.     Possible Opportunities To Start: Indianapolis Colts, Detroit Lions 1 year ago today, Carson Wentz made this throw#FlyEaglesFly pic.twitter.com/UNSHTOzdma— The Green Legion (@greenlegion) December 15, 2020  Alex Smith There isn’t a team in the NFL whose locker room would not be improved by the presence of Alex Smith. He’s never had the rocket arm that so many NFL prospects come into the league with, and has dealt with the expectations of being a number 1 overall pick who in the eyes of many, did not pan out. Most recently and most notably, the 36 year old quarterback had to battle back* from a devastating leg injury suffered in the 2018 season.     Smith has stabilized a Washington Football Team that started 1-5 this season, and now stands a good chance of winning the NFC East. It seems like Washington might want to set their starting quarterback expectations a little bit higher for 2021, and may bring Smith back as a reserve. But other franchises might be willing to woo Smith away from the nation’s capital to bring leadership to their rosters. Possible Opportunities To Start: Jacksonville Jaguars, New England Patriots, Minnesota Vikings Awesome awesome moment. Alex Smith with his first TD pass since November of 2018. Oh and he’s got Washington back in this game. Comeback player of the year. Name the award after him. pic.twitter.com/Pdeior2wIg— Matthew Berry (@MatthewBerryTMR) November 8, 2020      Jordan Love This scenario sticks out like a sore thumb, because this wouldn’t be an outside team looking for a calming veteran influence. If Jordan Love was named the starter heading into the 2021 season, then something seriously damaging would have had to happen between Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay Packers management. It’s unlikely that things get that contentious between the future Hall of Fame quarterback and the team, as Rodgers currently has the Packers in the mix for a number one seed, and is a frontrunner for the MVP award. But we have seen things turn rather quickly before in this situation with Green Bay in the past, as the team traded Brett Favre to the New York Jets in 2008 after they lost in the NFC championship game. The possibility of Love being the leader of the team seems remote now, but there’s always a chance.     Possible Opportunities To Start: Green Bay Packers       Jameis Winston Even though it has to be disappointing for Winston to have been bypassed for the opportunity to start in the absence of starting quarterback Drew Brees, there still figures to be teams who will value his sabbatical year learning under Saints head coach Sean Payton. The former number 1 overall pick will undoubtedly need to assure his next offensive coordinator that he will take much better care of the ball moving forward, but his arm talent and ability to make things happen is still better than many quarterbacks playing right now. Ideally, Winston would land with a team that has a Kevin Stefanski-like approach—which is to say, run the football as many times as possible, and only expose the quarterback in low risk play action settings.     Possible Opportunities To Start: New York Jets, Indianapolis Colts, Las Vegas Raiders, Washington Football Team, Detroit Lions, Chicago Bears       Taysom Hill Although slightly on the older side at 30 years old, Taysom Hill still feels like a young quarterback because fans have only seen him in short bursts. But Hill fits the same mold that has catapulted Kyler Murray, Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts(for now) to success—opposing defenses have to account for the possibility of the athletic jack-of-all-trades taking a draw play for 20 yards, just as much as a 20 yard throw up the seam.     Based on what has transpired this season in New Orleans, and with Brees likely to call it a career sooner rather than later, Hill seems to be the frontrunner to start at quarterback for the Saints next year. He received a two year contract extension in April, and has been a favorite of coach Payton for a few years now.Possible Opportunities To Start: New Orleans SaintsTaysom Hill💣 #KCvsNOpic.twitter.com/h7vcP2Dwhc— Looselines Sportsbook (@LooselinesRJ) December 20, 2020     "", '""Ryan Fitzpatrick reveals who he believes is the greatest QB of all time  Ryan Fitzpatrick is now retired and like most stars, he decided against going quietly into the sunset.

So we’ll be seeing plenty of Fitz going forward. Fitzpatrick went on to explain how he changed the game from a psychological aspect: ""And he changed the game with how he approached it from the mental side with all the things they were doing in the you know how I\'m sure you were able to see or remember the games at the RCA dome when it was so quiet when he was on offense.""     Fitzpatrick continued, outlining how he taught fans to be quiet when he was on offense and loud when the defense was on the field: ""[And it was] so loud, when they\'re out there on defense, but to have control and command every aspect of the game like he did, he was the most impressive by himself.” What Ryan Fitzpatrick saw in Peyton Manning\'s career San Francisco 49ers v Denver Broncos     While Peyton Manning doesn\'t have the same number of Super Bowls as Tom Brady, he had the edge in statistics. Of course, the Buccaneers quarterback eventually passed him in total stats, but the Broncos and Colts quarterback outpaced him by a wide margin when both still played.     The quarterback still has the record for the greatest number of touchdown passes thrown in a season and is credited for leading the most productive offense in NFL history in 2013. Manning was the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl with two separate teams.        In total, Manning was 186-79 in his career. He threw for 539 touchdowns and 251 interceptions. He played in 27 playoff games, going 14-13 and winning two Super Bowls. He played in four Super Bowls and won the Super Bowl as his last performance before retiring after the 2015 NFL season.     ', ""NFL 2020: Top 5 quarterback performances from Sunday (Week 5)  It was a bit of a quieter Sunday than normal for NFL and its quarterbacks in Week 5, as two games on the schedule were pushed back or postponed because of players testing positive for COVID-19.  Nonetheless, it was a fascinating week with several upsets, including the Las Vegas Raiders topping Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, the Miami Dolphins defeating the San Francisco 49ers, and the New York Giants getting close to taking down the Dallas Cowboys.        Here are Sunday's top five quarterback performances around the league.            #5 Jared Goff Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jared Goff The Los Angeles Rams had an opportunity for an easy win over the Washington Football team, and Jared Goff took advantage of it. Goff completed 21 of 30 passes for 309 yards with two passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown. He threw one interception and finished with a 111.7 passer rating. 309 passing yards for QB1 👏@JaredGoff16's best throws from the 30-10 win! pic.twitter.com/ubl9ir0iYF— Los Angeles Rams (@RamsNFL) October 11, 2020     The No. 1 pick in the 2016 NFL Draft is still young at just 25 years of age, and he's becoming much more accurate as the weeks go by. But considering all four of L.A.'s wins have come against teams in the NFC East, and their one loss was against the Buffalo Bills (4-0 going into their Tuesday night game), the Rams have yet to answer the question if whether they are a legitimate playoff team.  #4 Teddy Bridgewater Carolina Panthers quarterback Teddy Bridgewater     Carolina Panthers' quarterback Teddy Bridgewater didn't start off hot, but he didn't start off horribly either. Since Week 2, he has shown improvement and considering he was playing against the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, Bridgewater certainly should have blown the secondary away. Bridgewater completed 27 of 37 passes for 313 yards, with two touchdowns and a 116.2 passer rating. The Panthers face the Chicago Bears next Sunday, who are allowing 230.8 passing yards per game.  #3 Ben Roethlisberger Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger The 38-year-old Steelers QB continues to show that injuries and age won't stop him from performing well.     Big Ben has certainly impressed the league so far after some uncertainties over whether he would play football again. He shot the lights out against the struggling Philadelphia Eagles, completing 27 of 34 passes for 239 yards, with 3 touchdowns and a 125.4 passer rating. Considering the Steelers' schedule, a real test will come next week when they play their division rival Cleveland Browns. In some ways, the 4-0 #Steelers are positioned to handle an upcoming schedule that will increase in degree of difficulty, but in other ways there is important work to do.https://t.co/4Jm16VMYpJ— Bob Labriola (@BobLabriola) October 12, 2020 #2 Derek Carr Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr     In probably the biggest upset of the season so far, the Las Vegas Raiders were able to top the red-hot defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, and the quarterback was a big reason. Carr completed 22 of 31 passes for 347 yards, with 3 touchdowns, one interception and a 126.7 passer rating. His best throw went to rookie receiver Henry Ruggs III, who got his first career touchdown on Sunday. Hey. You.Yes, you.Here's @__RUGGS's first career TD that everybody is talking about. #RaiderNation#LVvsKC is on CBS. pic.twitter.com/eq7pP9BUly— Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) October 11, 2020 It's safe to say that the Raiders are an underrated team and teams who will face them in the future should look out for Carr and the rest of the company.      #1 Ryan Fitzpatrick Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick Coming in at No. 1, this is not only a surprise for everyone but for myself as well. The Dolphins' big upset over the 49ers was something the league was talking about, and it was all thanks to one man. Ryan Fitzpatrick completed 22 of 28 passes for 350 yards, with 3 touchdowns and a 154.5 passer rating. That's a nearly perfect rating. Could the Dolphins be a threat to win the AFC East and make a playoff run? They have lost to the Bills, New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks so far. These teams are all off to good starts, and considering how banged up the 49ers are, it could have been a one-off game for Miami. Either way, it is something for fans to keep an eye on.

He recently told one involving quarterback Tom Brady.   In an interview, the journeyman quarterback shared his favorite moment in his NFL career. He shared a story about when Brady didn\'t shake his hand after a game back when he was playing with the New York Jets:        ""Beating Tom Brady, after the first time, because after the first time he didn\'t shake my hand... I was on the Jets [for the second win, four years later], and I had to chase him down on the 50-yard line.""           Jeremy White@JeremyWGRThat\'s THE Ryan Fitzpatrick. #LEGEND insider.com/tom-brady-ghos…12012That\'s THE Ryan Fitzpatrick. #LEGEND insider.com/tom-brady-ghos… Handshakes after an NFL game are little moments of sportsmanship in a brutal sport, but they can also be used as a respectful way to poke fun at your opponent. Fitzpatrick hinted at this when he recreated the moment:     ""Apparently, he hates losing more than everybody else hates losing. When he does lose, I want a handshake."" Fitzpatrick claimed that the first instance of handshake rejection came while the quarterback played for the Buffalo Bills, who were one of Brady\'s chief rivals during his time with the New England Patriots.    Brady not shaking the hands of the opposing quarterback who defeated him is nothing new. Quarterback Nick Foles of the Philadelphia Eagles, who upset the Patriots in Super Bowl 52 in the 2017 season, memorably didn\'t get a handshake with Brady after his performance in the game.     Glen Macnow@RealGlenMacnowWe\'ve seen this story before in Philadelphia.profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2022/05/19/rya…263We\'ve seen this story before in Philadelphia.profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2022/05/19/rya… The three-time NFL MVP subsequently played down the missed connection but brushed off Foles once again in the 2020 season, when Foles, then the starting quarterback for the Chicago Bears, defeated Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 5. Later in that 2020 season, Brady didn\'t shake the hand of then-Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jared Goff after the Rams upset Tampa Bay in Week 11. Ryan Fitzpatrick and his NFL career The QB, while with the New York Jets     Fitzpatrick was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the seventh round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He\'s started 147 games for nine different NFL franchises: the Jets, Bills, Rams, Buccaneers, Miami Dolphins, Cincinnati Bengals, Houston Texans, Tennessee Titans, and the Washington Commanders last season.  In his career, he\'s thrown for 34,990 yards, 223 touchdowns, and 169 interceptions. Fitzpatrick is currently a free agent should a team want to sign the 39-year-old for the 2022 season.     ', 'Ranking all the stages of Ryan Fitzpatrick\'s NFL career  In an announcement that proved to be as much of a surprise to players as it was to fans, Ryan Fitzpatrick called time on his career after 17 seasons in the NFL.  The ""Fitz-magic"" era is now in the past, with the league losing one of its most charismatic players, who illustrated that increasing age didn’t have to equate to a downturn in performances.        The journeyman quarterback was loved wherever he went, even if he never quite had the ability to be an elite signal caller in the NFL. This is shown by the fact that he represented 9 teams throughout his time in the league.           His reliability and strength of character attracted teams to him as a backup option, yet invariably he would win-out and emerge as the starter at multiple teams. Field Yates@FieldYatesRyan Fitzpatrick served as the starting QB for 9 different teams in his career, the most of any player in NFL history.BengalsBillsBuccaneers CommandersDolphinsJetsRamsTexansTitans1143111Ryan Fitzpatrick served as the starting QB for 9 different teams in his career, the most of any player in NFL history.BengalsBillsBuccaneers CommandersDolphinsJetsRamsTexansTitans Fitzpatrick ended his career with a lengthy text message to teammates, with the Washington Commanders being his final destination before riding off into the sunset.     In appreciation of the popular quarterback, we have ranked his time in the NFL by his performances with each of the franchises he represented. #9 – Washington Commanders (0W 1L) Los Angeles Chargers v Washington Football Team It is somewhat upsetting that the worst period of Fitzpatrick’s career will be the last memory we have of him. He signed a one-year deal with Washington to be the team\'s starter and he held that role until his first game with the team. He was injured during the second quarter and didn\'t return. Unfortunately, the injury would result in him missing the entire season. Unless he changes his mind on retirement, it is the last we will see of the veteran quarterback on the field.     Not only did his Washington career stand at a single defeat, Fitzpatrick completed just three of six attempted passes, was sacked once and fumbled the ball once. #8 – St. Louis Rams (0W 3L)  St. Louis Rams 2005 Headshots The St. Louis Rams (now Los Angeles) drafted Fitzpatrick all the way back in 2005, yet he wasn’t the answer for the team at quarterback. In two seasons with the struggling team, he was able to start just three games, all of which came in his rookie year.     He threw for 777 yards and four touchdowns and couldn’t find a rhythm and was an immediate target for defenses. His ball retention skills were poor, he was sacked nine times and he fumbled the ball on three occasions. He had eight interceptions during his time with the Rams.

He won three, lost six and threw for 2,454 yards. Interceptions were still an issue as he racked up 12 on the year, but he did at least throw 14 touchdown passes. In one season with the Tennesee Titans, he was sacked 21 times and he fumbled the ball 9 times. Whilst he had rebuilt his reputation with the Buffalo Bills before signing with Tennessee, his spell with the Titans showcased some of his worst football. #6 – Cincinnati Bengals (4W 7L 1T) Detroit Lions v Cincinnati Bengals     As a seventh-round draft selection, it is unusual for a team to trade for you after you fail to succeed initially. However, Ryan Fitzpatrick was given a shot by the Cincinnati Bengals after the Rams decided to trade him, and it was a mixed experience. He didn’t play a single game in 2007 due to being a backup to Carson Palmer, but when injury struck the starter in the 2008 season, Fitzpatrick had his chance. He ranked third in rushing for quarterbacks in the 2008 season with 304 yards, although this was way before the emergence of modern, mobile playmakers.

It was here that popular opinion started to shift on the veteran, even if his numbers weren’t outstanding. People enjoyed and respected his lack of quit in the NFL, and the fact that he showed his attitude and drive on every play.     Greg Wolf@RealGregWolfThis window was ridiculous by Ryan Fitzpatrick, but the reaction after the 2 pt conversion even better! #Buccaneers #GoBucs #TBvsCIN61This window was ridiculous by Ryan Fitzpatrick, but the reaction after the 2 pt conversion even better! #Buccaneers #GoBucs #TBvsCIN https://t.co/IdzPgSF0tF Winston’s injuries gave Fitzpatrick his shot, and he responded by winning four of his 10 starts across two seasons. He only fumbled the ball four times across two years and was sacked 21 times, which highlighted an improvement in his weakest areas. #4 – Miami Dolphins (9W 11L) Miami Dolphins v New York Jets     2019 saw the Miami Dolphins become the latest team to secure the signing of Fitzpatrick. He had become the archetypal backup quarterback in the NFL and was being paid as such. In his debut season with the Dolphins, Fitzpatrick started 13 games. He had a record of 5-8 that year and threw for 3,529 yards, 20 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. These aren’t elite numbers, but he was able to keep the Dolphins team competitive whilst producing moments of extreme excitement in games.

After the disappointments in St. Louis and Cincinnati, he would spend four seasons in Buffalo, including the final two where he was the guaranteed starter and played every game. In three of his four years in Buffalo, he threw for at least 23 touchdowns and 3,000 yards. Fumbles and sacks were still a problem, but on a poor team it was Fitzpatrick who stood out. His 98-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens in 2009 is a franchise record and it’s fair to say this period built Fitzpatrick\'s reputation. Jefe@JSpenceTheKingWho remembers the longest passing TD in @BuffaloBills history??

He had an even record of six wins and six losses, throwing for 2,483 yards and 17 touchdowns. He made history for the Texans in a 2014 game against the Titans, throwing a franchise-record six touchdown passes in a single game, a record that still stands to this day.

Once again, fate would shine on the player who seemed born to be a backup. A pre-season punch from a defensive lineman to Geno Smith left the starter with a broken jaw and all of a sudden the former seventh-round pick was the Jets’ biggest hope. His 2015 season was historic as he gained his first winning record, leading the Jets to a 10-6 season.     He threw for 3,905 yards, the closest he would ever get to the 4,000-yard mark, but his 31 touchdown passes that season remain a franchise record, something the great Joe Namath never managed. Just two days after thumb surgery, Fitzpatrick would still play in a game against the Jaguars, throwing two touchdown passes. The overtime game-winning drive against the New England Patriots was a particular highlight. Fitzpatrick elevated himself to a bona-fide NFL starter, but his second year in New York fell flat, despite signing a guaranteed $12 million contract. Irrespective of that, his first year with the Jets was a player at his absolute best, who had extracted the absolute most out of the talent he had been given, and it’s the season that we will all remember the most when thinking of Ryan Fitzpatrick. brandon@JetsHateMeThe last Jets quarterback to beat the Patriots is now retired….

Ryan Fitzpatrick is arguably the NFL's most beloved player. From his interview antics, his gunslinger playstyle, and his down-to-earth demeanor, there's little to not like about the journeyman quarterback.  However, having a relatable personality doesn't translate into wins in the NFL. Fitzpatrick is entering his 17th season in the league. Is retirement knocking on the door if Fitz can't put together a winning season for the Washington Football Team?        FitzMAGIC? #FinsUp📺: #MIAvsLV on @NFLNetwork📱: NFL app // Yahoo Sports app: https://t.co/Gd3pMdskDl pic.twitter.com/qVzZt5R506— NFL (@NFL) December 27, 2020           Fitzpatrick's storied career can be summed up by his two nicknames: Fitzmagic and Fitztragic.  The former refers to when he leads his teams to victories in awe-inspiring fashion and the latter when he can't seem to execute a single scoring drive. So will the Redskins get Fitzmagic or Fitztragic in 2022? Will Ryan Fitzpatrick elevate the Washington Football Team? Washington is the ninth different team that Fitzpatrick will play for in the NFL. He may not be the team's long-term solution at quarterback but could be a short fix for a talented team. Fitzpatrick can certainly breathe some new life into Washington's struggling quarterback room.     Washington surprisingly earned a playoff berth in 2020, primarily due to a sub-par performance from the rest of the teams in the NFC East. Alex Smith, Dwayne Haskins and Tyler Heinicke all started at quarterback for Washington last season. Alex Smith ended the 2020 season with 1,582 yards, six touchdowns, eight interceptions, and a 78.5 quarterback rating (QBR). Dwayne Haskins had 1,439 yards, five touchdowns, seven interceptions and a QBR rating of 73.0. Tyler Heinicke played just one regular-season game, throwing for 137 yards and one touchdown, giving him a QBR of 48.3. However, Heinicke played well in Washington's playoff game against the Buccaneers, throwing for 306 yards and one touchdown with an interception and a QBR rating of 64.3.

Although Tua Tagovailoa started most of the games in 2020 for the Miami Dolphins, Ryan Fitzpatrick was thrown into action instead of the rookie during crucial moments. Fitzpatrick appeared in nine games and started seven. In those nine games, Ryan Fitzpatrick threw for 2,091 yards, 13 touchdowns and eight interceptions, with a QBR rating of 95.6.With wide receivers like Terry McLaurin and Curtis Samuel at his disposal, Ryan Fitzpatrick could continue to be a gunslinger. The offense shouldn't be a problem for Washington this season. With the team already boasting an elite defense, there's no reason why Fitzpatrick can't lead Washington to the playoffs.     "", ""Can Taylor Heinicke rekindle his 2020 magic with Ryan Fitzpatrick out?  Can QB Taylor Heinicke still play like he did at the end of the 2020 season?  The Washington Football Team is forced to start QB Taylor Heinicke for Week 2, with Ryan Fitzpatrick out indefinitely.        Taylor Heinicke has been in the NFL since 2015, but only recently made his name known. In 2020, he started in place of the benched Dwayne Haskins in Week 16 and went 12/19 for 137 yards and a TD in a losing effort. Taylor Heinicke also got the start in the Wild Card round with Alex Smith sidelined. He went 26/44 for 306 yards with a TD, INT, and rushing TD. Washington elected to re-sign him after the entire team showed respect for him after nearly knocking the Buccaneers out of the playoffs in the first round.           PFF@PFFThe return of Taylor Heinicke is tonight 👀2:00 AM · Sep 16, 20211548146The return of Taylor Heinicke is tonight 👀https://t.co/aWx51L2GGq     However, Taylor Heinicke didn't get named the starter for Week 1, and Ryan Fitzpatrick got the nod. After a slow start in the first quarter, Fitzpatrick suffered a hip injury, and Heinicke was called in. He was able to go 11/15 for 122 yards and 1 TD with a 73.3% completion rate. Unlike Fitzpatrick, Heinicke was at least able to move the chains, despite the loss. Now that Ryan Fitzpatrick is out for at least half the season, can Taylor Heinicke rekindle the magic he had at the end of the 2020 season,, or will he be just another one-trick pony in the NFL? Homer McFanboy@HomerMcFanboyFor as long as he remains healthy, Taylor Heinicke is going to be the people’s quarterback.

This town loves this guy. https://t.co/YazLhLbqTd     There's no real evidence to say that Taylor Heinicke won't be a quality starter in 2021. He had some strong outings in the preseason and was once seen as a hot trade target before Week 1. Heinicke was pretty consistent in training camp as well. The Washington Football Team seemed to be taking an approach with Heinicke as if he were a rookie entering the league. He has the potential and talent, but they don't want to rush him. After a decent performance from him in Week 1 and with Fitzpatrick being out, the team should at least throw him into the fire and see if he can hold up for a long stretch. Entering the NFL, Taylor Heinicke was seen as a good pocket passer who allowed routes to develop before throwing and with accuracy. A weakness was his small frame, but he hit the gym in the offseason and packed on 15 pounds of muscle. His deep ball isn't the greatest, but he doesn't need to rely on it much. Washington has good speed in their skill players, and can play to Heinicke's strengths on the field. Add in an elite defense and Taylor Heinicke should be able to get Washington back into the Wild Card round, barring any other injuries.

7,Josh Rosen,"[""What went wrong for QB Josh Rosen as the 2018 no.10 pick continues to struggle  The San Francisco 49ers have waived quarterback Josh Rosen, who will now look for his fifth team since being drafted in 2018.  The 49ers signed Josh Rosen off of Tampa Bay's practice squad late in the 2020 season. He struggled to impress in training camp, and 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan has been vocal about Rosen's poor performance.        “Josh Rosen is good, he was just in a bad situation” pic.twitter.com/yua7XvzVt3— dk 💫 (@HoodieSiakam) August 15, 2021           In the 49ers' first preseason game this year, Rosen played most of the second half and went 10/15 for 93 yards and an interception. That performance wasn't enough for the team to retain him for the upcoming season. It has been a torrid time in the NFL for Rosen, but what exactly happened?  What has gone wrong with QB Josh Rosen? Josh Rosen had 16 starts in 20 games through four seasons with four different teams. His high draft selection could be the only reason we are still talking about Rosen today.      The debate for years has been whether Josh Rosen's issues come from not getting a fair shake in the NFL. First-year head coach Steve Wilks made his first big move with the Cardinals with Josh Rosen, the fourth QB drafted and seen as possibly the best QB in the class.  His main flaws at the time were a need to grow up and mature into a better leader. As many do, Rosen had a poor rookie year, but Wilks was fired once Kliff Kingsbury became available. JOSH ROSEN'S REVENGE TOUR IS ON 🔥🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/ea5ZrP816i— Press Cover (@Press_Cover) August 15, 2021     Kliff Kingsbury wanted his guy for his system, and the best fit was Kyler Murray, the no.1 overall pick. Rosen was then traded to Miami, where he competed with Ryan Fitzpatrick, but struggled again, as he was tossed into a starting role before he was ready, which damaged his confidence.  Miami took QB Tua Tagovailoa 5th overall the next season, and it was deja vu for Josh Rosen. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers placed him in their practice squad and hoped to groom him with Tom Brady's help. But Rosen chose not to win a Super Bowl ring and signed with the 49ers. However, they took QB Trey Lance at #3 this year, and the rest is history. Breaking 🚨: 49ers Waive QB Josh Rosen #NeverForget pic.twitter.com/crCqxeYFXc— The Slumpbuster (@SlumpBusterPod) August 17, 2021     By now, it's a surprise that Rosen has chosen to remain in the NFL, so big props to him. Anyone's mental state and confidence would have been shredded to bits after being replaced three times by high draft picks that resulted in the player being shipped elsewhere.  Every team he's been in, other than Tampa Bay, was a poor fit for Rosen, even Arizona. Looking back, Josh Rosen needed a team with a veteran starter ahead of him, as he clearly wasn't NFL-ready but was full of potential. Two or three years of learning on the bench would've been the best for him. Honestly, the Pittsburgh Steelers came up every time Rosen became available. Josh Rosen was a victim of 'wrong place, wrong time' in the NFL and could return to his prime at 24. In his preseason game, his skills looked rusty, possibly because of his state of mind. Pittsburgh may still make sense, as their coaching staff is elite in finding the best in their players. The Dallas Cowboys, Seattle Seahawks, Tennessee Titans and LA Rams could also sit him on the bench and teach him from scratch.     "", 'NFL roster cuts 2021: 5 Players who surprisingly survived the roster cuts  On Tuesday, NFL teams had to make final decisions on who will be on the final 53-man roster heading into the upcoming NFL season. There were some surprises on both sides of the fence. The 2021 NFL offseason has been filled with surprises but none more significant than Cam Newton\'s release.  After looking at the final rosters for each NFL team, some surprising players were cut. Here\'s a quick look at the five players who made the final roster cuts.                   Which NFL players surprisingly made the final roster cuts? Atlanta Falcons QB Josh Rosen snuck by the final NFL roster cuts on Tuesday. #1 Atlanta Falcons, QB, Josh Rosen Josh Rosen signed with the Atlanta Falcons a week ago. Rosen only practiced three days before playing in the second half of the Falcons preseason finale. The #Falcons announce that QB Josh Rosen will make their initial roster.— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) August 31, 2021     The Atlanta Falcons were still unsure about Josh Rosen after his performance against the Browns. Rosen completed 9 of his 18 passes for 118 yards and a touchdown. That touchdown pass was the first one the Falcons threw during the preseason. On Tuesday, the Atlanta Falcons decided to keep Josh Rosen on their roster. After only being on the Falcons roster for a week and practicing three times with the team, Josh Rosen surprisingly made it through the final cut.  #2 Washington Football Team, TE, Sammis Reyes Sammis Reyes took a different path into the NFL. The Chilean-born tight end was a participant in the International Pathway Program. After participating in the Florida Gators pro day, Washington decided to sign Reyes to a three-year deal. Latest chapter in one of the game’s most unique new stories.Sammis Reyes is here 🔥(via @john_keim) pic.twitter.com/CLxXCMZGHV— B/R Gridiron (@brgridiron) August 31, 2021     The deal removed Reyes from the International Pathway Program, but keeping Reyes doesn\'t guarantee him a spot on the Washington Football Team roster. Reyes is Washington\'s best blocking tight end, which could be the reason they kept him. Washington Football Team GM Martin Mayhew praised Sammis Reyes. Mayhew stated that Reyes ""has every tool a team would want in an athlete"" during a press conference.  #3 Dallas Cowboys, Safety, Israel Mukuamu The Dallas Cowboys kept 13 defensive backs on their final 53-man roster. Israel Mukuamu was pegged as the odd man out but somehow slipped through the final cuts. Mukuamu sits third on the Cowboys\' depth chart in a strong safety position. When the Cowboys signed Malik Hooker, many fans believed Mukuamu was on the chopping block. The Cowboys took advantage of Mukuamu\'s versatility during the NFL preseason. Dallas utilized the rookie at free safety, slot cornerback, inside the box and the line of scrimmage.     Dan Quinn has plans for Israel Mukuamu. The plans may not be safe, but Quinn could use him as a utility defensive player in 2021.  #4 Los Angeles Rams, QB, Bryce Perkins The Los Angeles Rams made a great decision by keeping Bryce Perkins on their roster. Sean McVay will keep three quarterbacks, and Perkins will remain as the third-stringer. Los Angeles decided to keep Perkins because of his preseason performance. Bryce Perkins making the final cut is significant because NFL teams generally keep two quarterbacks. Perkins threw for 451 yards and three touchdowns during the preseason. The former undrafted free agent also added 114 rushing yards.  #5 Las Vegas Raiders, QB, Nathan Peterman The Las Vegas Raiders are another team that will keep three quarterbacks on its final roster. Las Vegas has two quarterbacks that can carry the workload in Derek Carr and Marcus Mariota. Keeping Nathan Peterman is a surprise to many.During the preseason, Nathan Peterman threw for 596 yards and two touchdowns. Peterman took all but one snap for the Raiders during the preseason. The negative is that he also threw four interceptions. Surprisingly, Gruden decided to keep Peterman after his inconsistencies. In that short time frame, Rosen has proven to be worthy of a roster spot.     ', '5 NFL QBs who went from starters to jobless due to one horrible season  Josh Rosen  The 2018 NFL season was one to forget in the desert as Josh Rosen\'s rookie campaign fell off the rails with the Cardinals. It may have arguably never been on the rails to begin with now that it\'s been given some thought.

Some of his QB stats were brutal relative to the competition, per 98.7 FM Arizona\'s Sports Station: ""Rosen ranked 33rd and last among qualified candidates with a quarterback rating of 66.7 this season. That ranked immediately behind rookie Bills QB Josh Allen’s 67.9 and rookie Jets signal-caller Sam Darnold’s 77.6 rating. Rosen was also 33rd by averaging 163 passing yards per game and just 5.80 yards per attempt.""     The leash in Arizona was so short that he was yanked from the position and was on a different NFL roster by year two. Miami took him on as Ryan Fitzpatrick\'s backup, and he couldn\'t play his way out of that role. No team took him on during the pandemic-stricken 2020 season. He was hardly given a chance with the Atlanta Falcons, though his 2/11 passing performance probably had a lot to do with that. Blake Bortles was at the top of the world in 2018 Blake Bortles It\'s somewhat tragic tracking the trajectory of Blake Bortles\' NFL career, thus far. The Florida-born quarterback played college ball at UCF. He was drafted with the 2014 NFL Draft\'s No. 3 pick to be the franchise signal-caller in Jacksonville. His rookie season was disappointing enough to put him on the chopping block. Somehow, he persevered and threw for 35 touchdowns in what was the antithesis of a sophomore slump.

Marcus Mariota 19.9 Things peaked in January 2018 when Bortles\' Jaguars went toe-to-toe with Tom Brady\'s Patriots, but the New England 24-20 win was the closest Bortles would get to being at the top of the NFL totem pole. His offensive line was shaky. His receivers weren\'t putting themselves in position to make plays, and ultimately Bortles himself no longer had the stuff to be the starter for any team, at least, according to the league. Mark Sanchez had a rough season in 2012, got injured, and never returned to a starting role     Mark Sanchez Mark Sanchez can definitely up the tragedy from Blake Bortles\' case. Sanchez came from USC as a top prospect and immediately had the Jets in the AFC Championship his first and second seasons after years of futility from the franchise, with Chad Pennington as the primary option under center. Then, Tim Tebow was brought into the mix. The ""butt fumble"" transpired at MetLife Stadium on Thanksgiving night 2012 just weeks after Hurricane Sandy. Sanchez was injured playing in a preseason game in the summer of 2013, while trying to earn the starting job. Sanchez\'s prospects of being a top option in someone\'s backfield were gone.        Then-Jets coach Rex Ryan spoke of his regret at even having the former first-round NFL Draft pick in the game late during a preseason game. He said that he would have changed things if he could: “That was a tough situation obviously. If I could go back and change things, of course you would. You don’t want anybody to ever get hurt. But again, you’ve got to decide, guys. Somebody has to play.” When it happened, Ryan was far less remorseful. He suggested that Sanchez being on the field was necessary. This would enable the team to decide who the starting QB would be for the 2013 season between Sanchez and Geno Smith: ""We\'re there to win. We had our starting offense out there for three quarters -- we\'re trying to win the game, that\'s what we wanted to do. … We\'re trying to compete. Everybody\'s out there and injuries are part of the game.""     No matter how Sanchez lost his 2013 season, it was clear he was no longer the guy in New York with second-round rookie Smith out to become QB1. He would never start again in his NFL career. Geno Smith was another Jets flameout Geno Smith Unfortunately, speaking of Geno Smith, he was a fellow Jets flameout in 2014. He joined the man he replaced and was neck and neck with during Gang Green\'s 2013 QB competition, Mark Sanchez. He had identical touchdowns to interceptions, but Smith\'s 2014 season hit an embarrassingly low-point in December of that year with the Jets limiting him to eight pass attempts for the first 58 minutes. When New York needed him to successfully run the two-minute drill, he threw an interception with 34 seconds left to close the door on a 16-13 loss.     Smith is, somehow, in the running for Seattle\'s starting job here in 2022, with the Seahawks competition coming down to the 31-year-old and one of the pieces in the Russell Wilson trade, Drew Lock. By no means is he a clear-cut NFL starter, and he hasn\'t been one in eight years. Colin Kaepernick is no longer be a starter for many reasons Colin Kaepernick This inclusion may be controversial, but Colin Kaepernick did not engineer a winning effort in San Francisco during his final seasons in the Bay in 2015 and 2016.        The 49ers made a business decision that had on-field ramifications during the winter of 2017 in cutting him. Jimmy Garoppolo, future Super Bowl QB, entered the room with long-time utility option C. J. Beathard.The fact that few teams have looked at him since then is probably primarily due to off-field distractions, but Kaepernick was never NFL starter material after showing the inability to hit his targets during a difficult 2016 campaign.     ', '“LeBron playing against Jordan’s competition finally”, “Somebody’s feeling insecure after Steph won ring #4” - Fans post mixed reactions to LeBron James’ Drew League return  LA Lakers superstar LeBron James played in the Los Angeles-based Pro-Am Drew League for the first time since 2011. James dominated the proceedings in Saturday\'s MMV Cheaters vs. Black Pearl game.  The four-time NBA MVP bagged 42 points, 16 rebounds and four steals to lead his team, the MMV Cheaters, to a narrow 104-102 win. James, coming off an injury-riddled campaign, appeared to be in great shape.         He produced several highlight reels during the contest. He paired up alongside DeMar DeRozan, who tallied 30 points and 14 rebounds.      James entered the offseason early. He missed seven of the last eight regular-season LA Lakers games. The team failed to make it to the postseason. That made James\' return to the court even more exciting for fans. It was a lengthy three-month absence, which is rare, considering James has played deep into the playoffs for majority of his career. As always, NBA Twitter erupted after seeing a polarizing figure like LeBron James taking part in a Pro-Am tournament after so long. With him outplaying his competition, the noise surrounding his appearance only increased. It drew hilarious yet mixed reactions from his fans and critics. One fan wrote: ""LeBron playing against Jordan’s competition finally"" Another added: ""Somebody’s feeling insecure after Steph won ring #4.""

However, Irving never showed up. Drew League commissioner Dino Smiley was unaware of the reason behind the Nets star\'s absence. He thought it was a ""sure bet"" that Irving would appear, but that wasn\'t the case.     The Brooklyn Nets All-Star guard reportedly participated in Lakers assistant coach Phil Handy\'s all-girls basketball training camp in LA. A viral video surfaced showing Irving teaching the campers some skill moves of his own. His appearance at Handy\'s camp only fueled rumors about his possible trade to reunite with James in LA. Handy was the assistant coach on the James and Irving-led Cavaliers team that made three NBA Finals appearances in a row, winning the title once.The Lakers have been looking to get rid of Russell Westbrook and have already engaged in discussions with the Brooklyn Nets over a possible trade swap. The teams haven\'t reached an agreement yet.     ', 'Ranking the 10 Worst NFL QBs of the 2010s  Quarterback is the most important position in the NFL and that won’t change for as long as the sport is played.  Over the past decade, we’ve seen some simply stupendous players throw the ball in the NFL, keeping fans astounded on a weekly basis. They impressed one and all with their feats of magic with the ball in their hands.        Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson have all but revolutionised their positions since being drafted, yet not every player can have such a positive impact. As is impossible to avoid, for every success story in the NFL, there is an equally negative outcome for another individual.           The 2010s saw some quite awful quarterback play from a number of guilty parties. Some were so bad that an infamous play is now named after them, whilst others failed to live up to expectations due to an out-of-control off-field life.  Who were the 10 worst NFL quarterbacks of the 2010s? #10 Geno Smith Baltimore Ravens v New York Jets     Geno Smith had talent at the quarterback position, but describing his career in the NFL as a negative snowball would be an understatement. However, it\'s not entirely his fault that he arrived at a poor New York Jets team that was bereft of leadership and veteran presence who were used to winning. After being drafted in the second round of the 2013 NFL Draft, Smith would hugely struggle with interceptions in his first two years, throwing a grand total of 34. He didn’t inspire any confidence within the locker room either. This ultimately culminated in an unfortunate incident. His own teammate, IK Enemkpali, broke his jaw with a right hook that left Smith out injured for most of the 2015 season. He never regained his place, and has since gone onto become a backup option with the Giants, Chargers and Seahawks. But in terms of quarterback production, Smith stands as one of the worst of the 2010s.      #9 Blaine Gabbert Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Jacksonville Jaguars Thrown into the dumpster fire that has been Jacksonville football for the best part of a decade, Blaine Gabbert has had a forgetful NFL career. It is worth nothing, however, that he is classed as a Super Bowl winner. Gabbert rode Tom Brady’s coattails to a championship in Tampa Bay, throwing a grand total of 27 passes in three years. But he remains one of the most disappointing picks of the previous decade. Picked 10th overall in the 2011 NFL Draft, Gabbert had a below average rookie year where he threw just 12 touchdown passes, as well as 11 interceptions. He was also sacked 40 times and fumbled the ball on 14 occasions.     It was a setback that he never recovered from, with the Jacksonville Jaguars never really having patience with him as a long-term starter again.  #8 Mark Sanchez New England Patriots v New York Jets Picked up by the New York Jets with the fifth overall pick in 2009, Mark Sanchez was supposed to save NFL football in the Big Apple. Instead, he is somehow remembered the most for his ""butt-fumble."" Ironically, the four years he had as a starter in New York were four of the better years the Jets have had for a long time. They had a strong roster that just needed a better quarterback. Sanchez made too many mistakes, some at the costliest moments, and that became his legacy.     He never finished a season with the Jets without at least nine fumbles. The butt-fumble was the worst of the lot. Not only did Sanchez misread what the play was supposed to be, but he didn’t have the awareness to know where his own O-Line were positioned. While attempting to slide to safety to avoid Vince Wilfork, he slid into the backside of one of the O-Line members, fumbling the ball in the process. Tobey MaCrier@shaneysmalls@BarstoolPhilly The Sanchez Butt Fumble@BarstoolPhilly The Sanchez Butt Fumble https://t.co/I9DqLmnCEW New York soon lost patience and Sanchez was out, with a specific QB training session called ""The Sanchez Program"" to eliminate QB fumbles being created.      #7 Jake Locker Tennessee Titans v Houston Texans The 2011 NFL Draft saw another QB taken earlier, with Jake Locker going to the Tennessee Titans at #8. When an NFL career lasts four seasons, with a player being a nailed-on starter in just one of them, that tells you everything you need to know. Locker was a backup in his rookie year and was then chosen to lead the Titans in his second year. In 11 starts, he threw for more interceptions than touchdowns and fumbled the ball four times.     Injuries followed, but Locker couldn’t escape the poor performances when he was on the field. He retired in 2015 citing a loss of passion for the sport, cementing his place as one of the biggest busts of the 2010s.  #6 Brandon Weeden Cleveland Browns v Denver Broncos Another name on the lengthy list of Cleveland Browns QB failures, Brandon Weeden arrived in 2012 as the 22nd pick at 28 years of age. His professional MLB career began with the New York Yankees in 2002, yet just a decade later he was in the NFL.     You have to commend the work ethic, but his career in professional football went exactly as you’d expect. He started 15 games as a rookie, throwing 14 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. These stats are alarming, but nowhere near as bad as some on this list. However, he just lacked the pop needed to survive in the NFL. His passes were simply not accurate enough and he was never going to take the team to the next level. Weeden\'s poor displays saw him constantly benched throughout his second year in Cleveland, and he was released at the end of the 2012 season.  #5 Christian Ponder Minnesota Vikings v Green Bay Packers     The sample size of Christian Ponder as an NFL quarterback is admittedly much larger than that of others on this list. But that just purely gives us more evidence to understand how bad he was. Given the starting job in Minnesota for three seasons after being drafted 12th overall in 2011, Ponder’s returns were woeful. His entire career with the Vikings ended with 38 touchdowns and 36 interceptions, as well as 20 fumbles. Ponder struggled to read defenses, even three years into life in the NFL, and he panicked as soon as any defender got near the pocket. He was one of those players who simply didn’t have the makeup to be an NFL quarterback.  #4 Josh Rosen Arizona Cardinals v Seattle Seahawks     Josh Rosen arrived into the NFL with a lot of hype as part of one of the most stacked QB draft classes in years. He was selected 10th overall by the Arizona Cardinals in 2018, but doubts were raised about his abilities and fit immediately. He would start just 13 games in his one and only year in Arizona, throwing 14 interceptions to 11 touchdowns. Rosen was sacked 45 times and fumbled the ball on 10 occasions to boot. It was a historically bad year for the Cardinals QB, and ironically one which helped the franchise out immensely. They were able to pick first overall in 2019 and got Kyler Murray, the replacement for Rosen. The latter was traded immediately to Miami, where he would start just three games, losing all of them whilst throwing just one touchdown and five interceptions. Rosen didn’t play at all in 2020 with the San Francisco 49ers, whilst in 2021, he threw just 11 passes all season, two of which were interceptions.     It’s hard to fathom the 10th overall pick being bounced between four teams in as many years. As a free agent in 2022, his NFL career is essentially over, and it is one of the most forgettable in living memory.  #3 DeShone Kizer Green Bay Packers v Baltimore Ravens Cleveland features heavily on this list, unsurprisingly, and DeShone Kizer was another name they drafted and spat out after years of disappointing performances. Hue Jackson wanted Colin Kaepernick signed, but received Kizer and oversaw the latter play his part in the 0-16 season.     Kizer started a full 15 games in the 2017 NFL season, but his performances were appalling. He completed just 53.6% of his passes, threw double the number of interceptions to touchdowns with 22 and 11 respectively, and fumbled the ball nine times. The fact that he led an NFL team to only the second ever 0-16 season is telling, and he never got to be a starter again. Kizer was traded to Green Bay after his rookie year, where he would throw 42 passes, no touchdowns and two interceptions. He has not played an NFL snap since and is unlikely to ever do so again.  #2 Johnny Manziel Cleveland Browns v Buffalo Bills     The only thing stopping Manziel from reaching the top spot on this list is that he had some natural talent as a quarterback. It’s almost entirely his own fault that he had such an abysmal career in the NFL. Selected by the Browns, every quarterback’s favourite franchise, Johnny Football entered the NFL as a celebrity before he had achieved anything at the pro-level. A rookie QB being fined for a hand-gesture made towards opposing fans in a pre-season loss is almost unheard of. Yet Manziel made it a reality. He would be judged accurately by the Browns’ coaching staff, who started Manziel in just two NFL games in 2014. He threw two interceptions and no touchdowns. Many expected 2015 to be the comeback year for Johnny Football. He was settled in Cleveland, but that proved to be his undoing as he appeared to party constantly. That year, he started six games and threw seven touchdowns to five interceptions, but his play was nothing more than below average by quite some distance.     A domestic violence incident was the last straw for the Browns. They were so desperate to get rid of Manziel, theyeven released a statement suggesting his future would be addressed ""as soon as permitted by league rules."" He never played in the NFL again.  #1 Paxton Lynch Atlanta Falcons v Denver Broncos Paxton Lynch was never a first-round calibre quarterback. He was then thrown into an awful situation created by the Denver Broncos and their mismanagement of Peyton Manning’s retirement. Once in the NFL, Lynch was just awful.     He would never do enough to convince the Broncos that he was starting QB material. Lynch played for the defending Super Bowl champions and threw just two touchdowns in his rookie season. His second season was no better, as he struggled to even get time on the field. The Broncos knew he was a bust and the rest of the watching world did too. Josh Kellem@JoshuaKellem#Broncos traded up for Paxton Lynch during 2016 #NFLDraft he\'s now getting outplayed by Case Cookus(?) in the #USFL if patient, team could\'ve drafted Dak Prescott on Day 2. crazy Lbroncoswire.usatoday.com/2022/06/07/usf…1#Broncos traded up for Paxton Lynch during 2016 #NFLDraft he\'s now getting outplayed by Case Cookus(?) in the #USFL if patient, team could\'ve drafted Dak Prescott on Day 2. crazy Lbroncoswire.usatoday.com/2022/06/07/usf… He threw 128 passes in the NFL with four being touchdowns and four being interceptions. For a first-round selection, that is a dreadful return on investment.     Lynch then had spells on the practice squads of Seattle and Pittsburgh, never doing enough to earn a deal. His NFL career was as short as it was dismal as a result.He was most recently picked in the 12th round of the United States Football League draft after playing as a third-string QB in the Canadian Football League.     ', ""NFL: What is next for Dwayne Haskins?  News broke on Monday that the Washington Football Team had released quarterback Dwayne Haskins, an expected move after his performance against the Carolina Panthers in what was a must-win game for Washington to secure a spot in the playoffs.  Haskins had his ups and downs in the 2020 season, as the second-year QB started the first four games of the season, going 1-3. He was benched and demoted to third-string QB after that and Kyle Allen was named the starter, with veteran Alex Smith as the backup.        Washington Football Team QB Dwayne Haskins Jr. took a sack on this play.You’ve got to be kidding me...#WashingtonFootball pic.twitter.com/78arXCmU0x— WFT Analysis | #BeatPHI (@WFTanalysis) December 28, 2020           Shortly after that, Allen suffered a season-ending leg injury, giving head coach Ron Rivera a difficult decision to either start Smith or Haskins. Eventually, Smith became the starting quarterback with Haskins being his backup. It wasn't expected for Haskins to ever see the field again unless Washington couldn't make it to the playoffs, but the day came when Smith was injured against the San Francisco 49ers and Haskins took over for the next two and a half games. His performance was average at best but was simply not good against the Panthers last week.      Will Dwayne Haskins ever see the field again? Many believe that Haskins' career as an NFL QB is simply done for. But since his rookie season, he has shown signs of being a star quarterback for a team willing to take a risk. Haskins is considered an old-school quarterback and not as mobile as many up-and-coming QBs in the league currently. That was one reason why he wasn't taken ahead of New York Giants' quarterback Daniel Jones in the same draft class. The fact of the matter is that Haskins needs to sit for a whole season behind a seasoned veteran, similar to Alex Smith. Teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers, New England Patriots, Atlanta Falcons, and even the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could sit a young guy who needs to mature over time to show what he can do on the field again. Wishing the best for @dh_simba7 You are only 23! Learn from this and bounce back— Robert Griffin III (@RGIII) December 28, 2020     He may not have worked out in the system that Washington has created, but Haskins could work out elsewhere. The situation brought to Haskins reminds us of Josh Rosen, who was drafted in the first round and then cut after one season with the Arizona Cardinals.Since then, he has been around a few teams and on practice squads. But Haskins certainly has more talent than Rosen, it's simply a matter of time and maturity for the former Ohio State quarterback.     "", ""5 NFL coaches Cardinals could've considered for HC instead of Jonathan Gannon\xa0  The Arizona Cardinals have a new head coach, Jonathan Gannon. The former Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator took on the job just days after taking his team to the Super Bowl. After working in a variety of positions on defense, he now takes his first head coaching job.  It might be a good fit, but he was not the only option available. There were reports that Arizona were trying to get Sean Payton before he chose the Denver Broncos. They interviewed other candidates as well who might have taken this job.        While we wish Gannon all the best, there are a couple of issues that stand out. An example being that the Eagles gave up 38 points in the Super Bowl and suffered some lapses in concentration during the final games of the regular season. Furthermore, with Kyler Murray's situation, maybe an offensive coach might have been better.           Considering such factors, we look at some other candidates the Cardinals could have chosen. Who else would have made sense for the Cardinals? #1 - Dan Quinn, DC, Dallas Cowboys NFC Divisional Playoffs - Dallas Cowboys v San Francisco 49ers     If the Cardinals wanted a defensive-minded coach like Jonathan Gannon, they could have looked at Dan Quinn instead. While Philadelphia allowed fewer yards per game, their points allowed was not as good as that of the Dallas Cowboys. While the difference was marginal (with the Eagles defense allowing 20.2 points per game compared to 20.1 for Dallas), Philadelphia was playing with Jalen Hurts, who did not turn the ball over with the frequency of Dak Prescott. That could have been a convincing argument to hire Quinn. However, he also has a head coaching pedigree, something Gannon does not. He took the Atlanta Falcons to the Super Bowl. At the time, he ensured that even though he came from a defensive standpoint, the offense flourished with Matt Ryan being named league MVP that season. Considering the situation in Arizona, where they need a coach who can develop Kyler Murray, this might have been a very good fit.     #2 - Eric Bienemy, OC, Kansas City Chiefs If one was looking for an offensive play-caller who has the resume to beat anybody else, it would have to be Eric Bienemy at the moment. He has been with the Kansas City Chiefs since 2018 and has won two Super Bowls. Bienemy has worked magic with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce and ensured that their offense flourishes even without Tyreek Hill this season.

The veteran coach gets credit for the play calls. However, considering that the Cardinals desperately need to figure out how best to use Kyler Murray, an offensive-minded coach like him could have been an asset.     #3 - Brian Flores, DC, Minnesota Vikings Pittsburgh Steelers v Miami Dolphins Brian Flores is the newly minted defensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings. He spent a year in Pittsburgh after his departure from the Miami Dolphins, but he now has a position in Minnesota. He was reported to have been interviewed for the job in Arizona. While Jonathan Gannon has done an amazing job this season, he does not have head coaching experience. That is something Flores had with Miami. He also had the job of handling a young quarterback there, who he had to mentor and help grow. He has been in that situation before as a head coach and might have risen to the occasion with the Cardinals.     #4 - Mike Kafka, OC, New York Giants In this year's NFL honors, the Coach of the Year award went to Brian Daboll. Not many would argue with it given where the New York Giants were a year ago compared to them making it to the Divisional round this season. One of the main reasons for their improvement was the increased maturity shown by quarterback Daniel Jones. Much of that credit should go to Mike Kafka, who oversees the offense there. felix 🇵🇷@FootballPapiNews coming through as I'm at work: Jonthan Gannon getting the Cardinals job means that #Giants OC Mike Kafka returns and gets another year with Daniel Jones.

This is someone who could have been just the right person to take Kyler Murray's development to the next stage. #5 - Steve Wilks, DC, San Francisco 49ers Denver Broncos v Carolina Panthers One can see why the Cardinals went with a defensive coach like Gannon. Despite needing someone to cajole the best performance out of Kyler Murray, another worry was their defense. They shipped 26.2 points per game, the second-worst in the league behind the Chicago Bears.     When confronted with this dual problem, the best person based on current record should have been Steve Wilks. He was the interim head coach of the Carolina Panthers and turned around a team that had looked hopeless all season. He suddenly got Sam Darnold looking like a real quarterback. He also tightened the defense and improved the run game. He showed his all-round caliber. The obvious issue with this choice would have been his previous history with the Cardinals, where he finished 3-13 in the 2018 season. However, that was before Kyler Murray was drafted and he had to manage with Mike Glennon and Josh Rosen.Considering his familiarity with the Cardinals and given both he and the team were in a different situation then, this could have been a possible, albeit unusual, option.

He was supposed to be a ""can’t miss"" prospect that would lead the team to new heights.  Darnold was seemingly more polished than Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson, more NFL-ready than Josh Rosen, and more composed than Baker Mayfield.        Fast forward three NFL seasons, and with the exception of Rosen, Darnold is viewed as the least successful first-round quarterback in the 2018 class. It’s tough to pinpoint exactly where things went awry for him. He’s had double digit-interception totals in all three seasons, though he has never played in all 16 games.           Sam Darnold is not having a good day. 22 total passing yards in the first half and this ugly interception.https://t.co/3EFtVws16x— NFL Update (@MySportsUpdate) September 13, 2020 To be fair, his sack percentage (percentage of times sacked while attempting to pass) has only increased each year, which speaks to the lack of protection he’s received throughout his time with the Jets.     Because the Jets hold the second overall pick in 2021 NFL Draft, they are in prime position to select another blue chip quarterback prospect. If they go in that direction, then Darnold will probably be sent packing to another NFL team. Where could Darnold wind up next season? The Houston Texans could take a chance on Sam Darnold    The largest potential domino to fall in the 2021 NFL offseason will be Deshaun Watson and his apparent desire to leave the Houston Texans. He’s only 25 years old, and his ceiling is as high as any quarterback not named Patrick Mahomes. It’s been rumored that Watson would welcome a trade to the Jets, as he reportedly believes in new head coach Robert Saleh. Even with Watson, the Texans are in rebuilding mode after they lost several key starters in the past year or so. They will need a young quarterback to build around if Watson heads elsewhere, and Darnold might be an attractive option. It might be difficult for Darnold to succeed in Houston with a barren roster, but the Texans can take a chance on a former first-round pick.     Sam Darnold could succeed with the Denver Broncos Denver Broncos v Carolina Panthers The Broncos, unlike the Jets and the Texans, have many promising players on offense. Jerry Jeudy, K.J. Hamler and Tim Patrick are promising receivers. Tight end Noah Fant is one of the game’s young, emerging players, and he also serves as an enticing weapon. The question for Denver is whether new general manager George Paton thinks that Drew Lock can utilize these weapons properly in order to guide the team to the playoffs. So far, Lock hasn’t been any more impressive than Darnold in his career.     Because Darnold has slightly more seasoning, Denver could look his way, as he\'s more of a finished product than Lock.

First-round draft pick Dwayne Haskins began the 2020 season as the team\'s starter, but it was clear that his lackluster level of play and leadership ability didn\'t meet Washington\'s expectations. Alex Smith stepped up when he got the opportunity to start for the team. He won the 2020 Comeback Player of the Year award, did a competent job leading the team, but the team released him after the year. When Smith was unable to play, journeyman Taylor Heinicke had an impressive performance in the Wild Card Round this past season, but he has no other NFL experience to speak of.

This team isn\'t that far away from a legitimate contender, so it might look to Darnold to help provide stability at the game\'s most important position. Washington could be a great destination for Sam Darnold because head coach Ron Rivera is regarded as one of the best leaders in the game. Sam Darnold could be the Atlanta Falcons\' next star QB Atlanta Falcons v Los Angeles Chargers     The perception and reality of the Atlanta Falcons\' future appear to be two very different things. The perception of the team is that it still has the ability to contend in the NFL. Atlanta features an established quarterback in Matt Ryan and two tremendous wide receivers in Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley. On paper, this team could hang with any team in the league. That being said, Atlanta has been mediocre at best recently. Since the teammade the Super Bowl in 2016, Atlanta only recorded one winning season. The Falons bottomed out last year at 4-12. Most signs point towards the likelihood that the core of the team will return for 2021, but it would not be surprising if the Falcons decided to shake things up. At worst, it would be wise for the team to consider its future at the quarterback position.

Sam Darnold could lead the Philadelphia Eagles\' new era Washington Football Team v Philadelphia Eagles The Eagles are going to be an interesting team to watch this offseason. Will they embrace the dual-threat quarterback movement that has worked so well for the Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills and Arizona Cardinals? Or will they bring in someone else to operate a more traditional offense under new head coach Nick Sirianni?     Jalen Hurts figures to be in the mix one way or another, as last year’s second-round pick put up a fairly positive performance in relief of embattled starter Carson Wentz. The Eagles may not want to go the damaged goods route again with Darnold, but he\'s a viable choice if they belief that Hurts is not progressing enough as a passing threat.It\'s easy to see Sam Darnold fitting in on any one of these teams, and any number of other contenders could vie for his services, too.Also Read: Who is Baker Mayfield’s Wife, Emily Wilkinson?

Inside Ravens superstar’s NFL Combine issue  For years, the NFL Combine has become a way for NFL players to showcase their talent to interested teams. An event lasting for hours, there are plenty of activities one can take part in. Lamar Jackson, currently with the Baltimore Ravens, always wanted to be drafted as a quarterback.  Buffalo Bills@BuffaloBillsBaker Mayfield. Josh Rosen. Lamar Jackson. Josh Allen.: #NFLCombine on @nflnetwork467107Baker Mayfield. Josh Rosen. Lamar Jackson. Josh Allen.📺: #NFLCombine on @nflnetwork https://t.co/etJGSLzX8S        Irrespective of the result, the combine is essential for players and how teams evaluate them. Sometimes, poor performances during the NFL Combine can directly affect an athlete\'s draft number.           Jackson, the Ravens\' No. 32 overall pick in the first round, refused to run the 40-yard dash. Apparently, his decision came after a team wanted to see how he would play if converted to a wide receiver. Jackson decided that he would only throw and not take part in any of the speed drills. He revealed details about the Combine while on the Ravens podcast, shortly after he was drafted by the team. ""It was a Chargers scout who told me about it. He was the first one to come to me about it. I\'m like, \'What?\' He caught me off guard with it. He added: ""I even made a face at first like, \'What?\' I thought he was trying to be funny, but he kept going with it. So it just became blown out of proportion"".     Lamar Jackson at the Pittsburgh Steelers v Baltimore Ravens game  Can Lamar Jackson hit the market as a free agent soon? Since last season, the Ravens and Jackson have been trying to find common ground for a long-term deal. However, the team and the QB haven\'t come to any conclusion about the numbers yet.

Smith said otherwise. As per the analyst, Jackson was never asked for a fully guaranteed deal. Smith reportedly spoke to Jackson\'s people, who confirmed this information. In September, the Ravens offered Jackson a five-year, $250 million contract, which Jackson declined. Out of the total, $133 million was guaranteed. However, reports added that Jackson wanted more guaranteed money.Lamar Jackson at the Denver Broncos v Baltimore Ravens gameWith Jackson not playing a complete season with the Ravens, the team might be hesitant to offer him a contract.

8,Drew Lock,"['Broncos should regret Wilson trade following MNF performance  The Denver Broncos shocked the NFL world when the team announced that they were acquiring Nine-time Pro Bowl quarterback Russell Wilson in a trade this offseason.  Unfortunately for Denver, their new quarterback hasn\'t been the player they bargained for. After an atrocious second-half performance against the Chargers on Monday Night Football, Wilson proved to be true once more.        Over the last handful of seasons, fans league-wide have described the Broncos as a team one [franchise] quarterback away from being a legitimate contender. With the acquisition of Russell Wilson, who\'s earned an All-Pro selection as well as a Super Bowl ring, Denver finally grabbed the quarterback needed to take the next step.           Or so the team thought. The hype around Denver\'s new roster was massive, adding Wilson to a team that has already fielded a fantastic defense. Fans were ready for Russ to \'cook\', and even began chanting ""Let\'s Ride"" as the team rode into the regular season. The Broncos\' defense has lived up to expectations, surrendering the third-lowest number of yards per game in addition to the fourth-least points. While the defense is proving to be exactly as advertised, the new quarterback in town has been nothing short of disappointing. Over the course of the season, Wilson has found himself with 5 passing touchdowns (T23), an 82.3 quarterback rating (23), and the fifth-lowest completion percentage in the NFL.     As bad as those numbers are, they\'re fantastic compared to what Wilson posted in the second-half of his most recent game on Monday, where the 33-year-old went three-for-eleven with 15 passing yards and a quarterback rating of 39.6; a rating equivalent to throwing the ball into the dirt on every snap. Jeff Kerr@JeffKerrCBSRussell Wilson was 3-of-11 for 15 yards and 0 TD in the second half and OT. 39.6 rating. The #Broncos gave Wilson $124 million guaranteed. #BroncosCountry36085Russell Wilson was 3-of-11 for 15 yards and 0 TD in the second half and OT. 39.6 rating. The #Broncos gave Wilson $124 million guaranteed. #BroncosCountry This is only the latest disappointing performance from a player Denver traded a king\'s ransom to acquire. That being the case, it\'s almost safe to say that the Broncos made a mistake trading for Wilson - a huge mistake that may linger for years.      The Broncos should be regretting the Russell Wilson trade while Seattle celebrates Denver Broncos v Las Vegas Raiders Getting the Seahawks to agree to terms with a trade for Wilson was no light task. In the end, it took Drew Lock, Shelby Harris, Noah Fant, two first-round draft picks (\'22, \'23) and two second-round draft picks (\'22, \'23). The Broncos also tossed a fourth-rounder in the 2022 NFL Draft, while Seattle gave up an additional \'22 fifth-round pick.     To put it bluntly, this is shaping up to be one of the worst trades of the decade. There\'s nothing to show Russ\' worth throughout the six weeks of the season. The numbers are bad, and so is the 2-4 record Denver now has. Even with an offensive line that ranks eighth in PFF\'s latest rankings, Wilson is unable to do much of anything. The situation is even worse when you factor in the five-year, $245 million extension Wilson received following the trade. In fact, this means Russell Wilson and the Denver Broncos will be conjoined for some time; seven years, in fact. On the other hand, the Seahawks are thriving with their new additions. Both Shelby Harris and Noah Fant are starters in Seattle, just as they would be for the Broncos. These two players have earned a PFF grade north of 70 in the early portion of the year, while Wilson finds himself under 60.     Right off the bat, this means Denver traded two starting-caliber players for Russell Wilson, who both continue to play great football with their new team. The \'22 first-round draft pick shipped to Seattle happened to be the ninth-overall pick. With such a high selection, Denver could\'ve got a stud regardless of which direction they wanted to travel in. For the Seahawks, they went with OT Charles Cross. Cross has earned a 64.6 grade in pass blocking at his left tackle position, allowing 14 pressures through six contests. We can\'t forget Drew Lock, either. While he might seem insignificant in this trade, don\'t underestimate the value of a backup quarterback. Some coaches even go as far as saying the starting quarterback of a team is the most important player, and the QB2 is the second-most important. The real kick in the face here is Geno Smith, who took over as Seattle\'s quarterback following the Russell Wilson trade.     Geno is severely outplaying Wilson. While Russ has recorded the fifth-lowest completion percentage in the NFL, Smith is currently the league-leader. On top of that, Smith has the third-highest quarterback rating; a ranking much different than Wilson\'s 23rd.Perhaps the Broncos can fix things down the road, but for now, the Russell Wilson trade remains one of the most one-sided deals over the last handful of years. Wilson\'s atrocious second-half performance on Monday night only helped solidify that.     ', 'Denver Broncos training camp 2021: 5 players to watch  The Denver Broncos are taking their lives one day at a time at the moment. They are currently at the forefront of the minds of Aaron Rodgers and Deshaun Watson as potential landing spots, according to recent speculation. Depending on how the next few weeks shape up, the Denver Broncos could easily see five wins come or go depending on who they land.  Meanwhile, they also have to keep an eye on their current players and build a plan for the season based on what they can do. Here are five players they\'ll be watching closely going into training camp.        Who the Denver Broncos cannot wait to get another look at           #1 - Drew Lock Drew Lock is the main reason the Denver Broncos are in a mess at quarterback. He started his career by throwing seven touchdowns and three interceptions in his rookie season. In 2020, Drew Lock threw for 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. Will the real Drew Lock please stand up? Drew Lock\'s performance in training camp is likely to determine his future at the franchise. However, he will first need to beat Teddy Bridgewater to the punch. Could Drew Lock surprise the Denver Broncos? #2 - Teddy Bridgewater Teddy Bridgewater was added to the roster this offseason before news broke about Aaron Rodgers and Deshaun Watson. Bridgewater is coming off a 5-11 season as the starter for the Carolina Panthers. Before that, he had a great stint in relief for Drew Brees when he went 5-0. It remains to be seen which Bridgewater turns up this season.         Bridgewater\'s competition with Drew Lock could be one of the longest competitions of the preseason, assuming Aaron Rodgers or Deshaun Watson do not end up in Denver. #3 - Javonte Williams Phillip Lindsay\'s loss was one of the biggest mistakes of the offseason for the Denver Broncos. However, they attempted to make up for it by drafting one of the top backs in the NFL Draft in Javonte Williams. Training camp could give an early indication of whether the Denver Broncos upgraded or downgraded at running back.     Denver\'s Javonte Williams earns the second spot on this list:""In 2020, according to Pro Football Focus, no FBS back forced more missed tackles on rushes than Williams\' 76."" https://t.co/A488AOVBQD— Aric DiLalla (@AricDiLalla) June 7, 2021 There could also be an outside chance that Williams pushes Melvin Gordon for the starting role. Overall, this is one of the juciest duels to watch when trying to evaluate the new Denver Broncos general manager George Paton. #4 - Garett Bolles For most of his career leading up to last season, Garett Bolles was one of the biggest misses in John Elway\'s career as general manager. He was notorious for causing penalties in critical situations. In 2019, Garett Bolles had 17 penalties called on him.     But right around the time his rookie contract was nearing its end, Bolles stepped up his game. He earned a PFF grade of 90.6 and only had seven penalties called on him. Above all, he did not allow a sack. In response, the Denver Broncos signed him to a big four-year deal worth almost $68 million. Now, after earning his big contract, the question is whether Garett Bolles can match up to the numbers in his contract. His performance in the 2021 training camp will be a big indication as to whether the Denver Broncos\' investment paid off. #5 - Bobby Massie Bobby Massie was seemingly signed as an act of desperation by the Denver Broncos after learning that Ja\'Wuan James had suffered another potentially season-ending injury. Bobby Massie outlasted the first couple of months of free agency, so based on that alone, the feeling that the Denver Broncos have a quality player comes more out of hope than anything else.     Bobby MassieThat said, PFF has given his last few seasons respectable grades. In 2020, Bobby Massie earned a 72.6 PFF grade and played 470 snaps. He only had one penalty and allowed three sacks. The biggest question around Massie is whether he will allow fewer than six sacks this season, which is what he was on track for last season.     ', 'Report reveals Browns player was unhappy with Baker Mayfield\'s poor performance in training  Baker Mayfield is currently facing a battle for his NFL future, which lies in limbo. He remains on the Cleveland Browns\' roster despite the franchise making it abundantly clear they will be moving forward with Deshaun Watson as their starting quarterback.  A recent report has questioned Mayfield\'s ability and that he was regularly poor in practice, according to an unnamed Browns player. The information contained a quote from a Browns player. The statement addresses a video Odell Beckham Jr.\'s father released on social media in November last year, showing the quarterback not throwing the ball to his son, who was open on several occasions.                View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post           According to the report, when asked if he had seen the video posted by Beckham Jr.\'s father, the unnamed Browns player gave a scathing response. He said: ""Why would I watch the video? I see it every day in practice."" Offseason Chopz@Pchopz_Oh boy.3417478Oh boy. https://t.co/edYCPG2S1j     This is another negative view that could hinder Mayfield\'s search for a new team. With the NFL Draft ending, the chance for the Browns to move him on to pastures new and focus on the future with a different quarterback have also diminished. The Carolina Panthers were interested in Mayfield, but recent reports have shown that they were never close to a deal with the Browns. The Panthers went on to draft Matt Corral, who will challenge Sam Darnold for the starting job in Charlotte.        Other potential teams that needed a quarterback have made moves to find the piece to the puzzle, with the Pittsburgh Steelers drafting Kenny Pickett and the Seattle Seahawks set to move forward with Drew Lock behind center. Seattle head coach Pete Carroll recently stated that the Seahawks weren\'t looking to add another quarterback \'at all\' to their roster, which puts an end to Seattle being a possible destination for Mayfield.  Why are teams reluctant to make a trade for Baker Mayfield? One of the main hurdles is the quarterback\'s $19 million salary due in 2022. Teams seem reluctant to take on that amount, which reportedly led to the Panthers\' and Browns\' inability to agree on trade terms.   It also seems highly unlikely that Mayfield will stay and offer back-up for Watson as he sees himself as the starting quarterback. Based on the NFL Index quarterback rankings, he ranked 25th out of 62 quarterbacks, with his inconsistency proving to be a significant shortcoming.     ', 'Von Miller praises Teddy Bridgewater for leadership after Week 1 win  Many were wary about Teddy Bridgewater being named the starting QB for the Denver Broncos this season. He was 4-11 as a starter with the Carolina Panthers in 2020 and 5-1 over two years with the New Orleans Saints.   He may not have had the best preseason performance, but head coach Vic Fangio saw something in him that Drew Lock didn\'t. Von Miller may have seen the same thing now.

There was the era of Peyton Manning from 2012 to 2015 where Von Miller played two Super Bowls and won one. Since Manning retired, it has been a rough going for the Broncos. With Teddy Bridgewater, it seems like things were still going to be the same.     Against the New York Giants in Week 1, Teddy Bridgewater went 28/36 (77.78%) for 264 yards and two TDs. I would say that was better than most people expected him to play, and he showed great accuracy on his intermediate throws.

Miller told Teddy that he hadn\'t felt that way in a long time, since back when ""18 was here"".      The reference of 18 was Peyton Manning. Miller praised Teddy Bridgewater for his pep talks, and said they go a long way. His pep talks obviously worked well enough to get the win in Week 1.  It\'s also a huge positive for Teddy, as his leadership skills shine along with his abilities on the field. Vic Fangio may have made the right call after all by going with Teddy over Drew Lock.

Teddy Bridgewater will need to avoid turnovers that cost the team the victory and stay accurate with his throws, though. Hell, those Aaron Rodgers rumors of him joining the Denver Broncos could be over by the trade deadline at this rate. That was especially after how bad Aaron Rodgers was in Week 1 and how good Teddy Bridgewater fared during the same week.     ', '5 strengths and weaknesses for the Denver Broncos heading into the 2021-2022 season\xa0  The Denver Broncos were the weakest team in the AFC West in 2020 and finished last with a 5-11 record. For as much promise as quarterback Drew Lock has shown over the years, he and the team fell short last season. There was also a game in late November 2020, when, due to COVID-19, the Broncos were left without a starting quarterback.  The Broncos now have a lingering quarterback competition in training camp. They also have other decisions to make before the 2021 NFL season officially begins. But what makes the Broncos good, and what is keeping them from showing their full potential?        5 Weaknesses for the Denver Broncos           #1 - Quarterback Situation The Broncos traded for Teddy Bridgewater from the Carolina Panthers this offseason. The Denver Broncos even seemed interested in trading for Aaron Rodgers from the Green Bay Packers but have made no progress on that front. The Broncos now have Bridgewater and Drew Lock. While Bridgewater brings experience and talent to the quarterback room, the Broncos could still acquire a quarterback before the season starts. But by trading for Bridgewater, the Broncos have shown that they lack confidence in Lock. But if Lock is named the starting quarterback after training camp, it will show that the team doesn\'t have much faith in Bridgewater. Either way, it will cause a distraction in training camp that may hinder the entire team. ICYMI: There’s one way Denver Broncos can be become the “sleeping giant” immediately and it rests on the shoulders of the performance of QB Drew Lock. Here’s my story. https://t.co/MIceIkQEAz— Cameron Parker (@CamParkerPO) June 28, 2021     #2 - Offensive Line Garett Bolles had a shaky start to his NFL career due to injuries. The Broncos even declined the fifth-year option on Bolles\' contract before the 2020 season. But last season, he proved why the Broncos drafted him in the first round of the 2017 NFL draft and was an integral part of the offensive line. The team re-signed him to a four-year, $68 million contract extension this offseason.  The Broncos lost Ja\'wuan James to an offseason injury, and he was subsequently cut from the team. The Broncos did re-sign tackle Calvin Anderson, who played in two games last season. Regardless of which quarterback is under center, they are likely to have difficulty behind the Broncos\' offensive line.  #3 - Not Utilizing K.J. Hamler K.J. Hamler was a standout kick and punt returner as well as wide receiver at Penn State. Although he may have made the jump to the NFL a season too early, he was still highly rated in pre-draft projections and the Broncos drafted him in the second round.     Hamler was known as the ""human joystick"" for his ability to maneuver around opposing defenses and special teams. But the Broncos haven\'t used Hamler as well as they should have.  Diontae Spencer is the primary returner for the Broncos and is quite effective. But adding Hamler to the mix, with his speed and talent and on the offense, would add another dimension to it. #4 - Losing RB Phillip Lindsay Running back Phillip Lindsay made a splash in the NFL as an undrafted free agent in 2018, rushing for over 1,000 yards and nine touchdowns. In 2019, Lindsay rushed for over 1,000 yards again and seven touchdowns. In 2020, his production went down due to injury and he ran for just over 500 yards. The Broncos placed a restricted, right-of-first-refusal tender on Lindsay, but the two sides never agreed upon a contract extension, making him a free agent. He later signed with the Texans. Losing Lindsay and not adding another running back will hinder the Broncos\' offensive unit.     #5 - The inability to beat the Kansas City Chiefs The Broncos have lost 11-straight games against division rival Kansas City Chiefs. They haven\'t scored a victory over the Chiefs since 2015, although they were competitive and came close in 2020. To be competitive and be a contender in the AFC West, the Broncos need to find a way to get at least one win in their two games against the Chiefs. 5 Strengths for the Denver Broncos #1 - Secondary The Denver Broncos\' secondary is one of the best in the National Football League.  The team is stacked at the corner position. Last season Bryce Callahan, A.J. Bouye and Michael Ojemudia were three of the top outside corners in the league. Callahan will now move inside after the Broncos picked Patrick Surtain II in the first round of the 2021 NFL draft. The team also has Kareem Jackson and Justin Simmons, who are among the top two safeties in the NFL.     The Denver Broncos secondary sports 2 of the biggest ballhawks in the NFL pic.twitter.com/v4E6gMqCcJ— PFF (@PFF) June 9, 2020 #2 - The return of Von Miller Outside linebacker and one of the Broncos\' best pass rushers, Von Miller, missed the entire 2020 season with an ankle injury that he suffered in practice just before Week 1. Now that Miller is healthy once again, the Broncos will have that force off the edge they were missing in 2020. #3 - Drafting Patrick Surtain II Many Broncos fans were disappointed after the team drafted Patrick Surtain II in the first round with the ninth overall pick.     While some fans are still upset that the team passed on drafting a quarterback, the addition of Surtain to the roster gives the secondary another elite cornerback on the outside and makes the defense even more potent. Surtain could quickly become a fan favorite if he can perform at the same level that he did in college. #4 - WR Tim Patrick The 2020 season was a breakout season for wide receiver Tim Patrick. He surpassed all of his and the team\'s expectations.  In 15 games, he had 742 receiving yards and six touchdowns. Playing on a second-round tender for the 2021 season should motivate Patrick even more this upcoming season. #5 - Kicker Brandon McManus Like most NFL players, Brandon McManus had a few challenging stretches in 2020. In one game, he missed two of his four extra-point attempts. But since signing with the Denver Broncos in 2012, he has made 82.4% of field goals and 88.9% of his extra points attempts.In 2020, McManus made a career-long 58-yard field goal. He signed a four-year, $17.2 million contract extension last season.     ', '\xa0NFL fans and analysts high on Malik Willis after Combine  Malik Willis is making a name for himself at the 2022 NFL Combine in Indianapolis. The former quarterback for the Liberty University Flames has been torching the annual event that showcases the potential for college players.  Reports coming out of Indianapolis have revolved around Willis displaying an aerial assault that was a weekly exhibit at the college level on Saturday afternoons.        The former transfer from Auburn University did not run, which has become almost customary for some signal-callers who have shown the ability to make plays with their legs (such as Lamar Jackson).           Willis stands at 6\'1"" and weighs 216 pounds. Despite what is generally considered a lack of height, players like Drew Brees and Russell Wilson have made silly exceptions to these assumptions. The star quarterback also made the news this week as he was seen on video helping a homeless person. He was unaware that the video was being taken, which showed the empathy and humility of the future NFL player.

How can you not be a fan of this guy? https://t.co/BmFzUM66NU     NFL executives don\'t miss a beat, so this video certainly helped answer questions about the level of maturity of the young man who will be a part of the NFL next fall. Which team will draft Malik Willis? LendingTree Bowl - Liberty v Eastern Michigan Several teams need a starting quarterback going into the 2022-2023 NFL season. The Denver Broncos will likely not retain quarterback Teddy Bridgewater or Drew Lock. Bridgewater does not stretch the field, and Lock has proven inconsistent. The New Orleans Saints\' incumbent signal-caller Jameis Winston is coming off a severe ACL injury and is a free agent.     The Tampa Bay Buccaneers just lost the great Tom Brady to retirement. But one of the teams that sees itself as a part of heavy rumors to acquire the services of the former Liberty University quarterback is the Pittsburgh Steelers. After 18 glorious NFL seasons, Ben Roethlisberger decided to hang up the cleats as a Steelers player. The future Hall of Famer\'s decision placed an asteroid-sized void at the position for the franchise tied for the most Super Bowls in history with six. Pittsburgh head coach Mike Tomlin has already made it known that he prefers a quarterback that can move and that has some escapability.  Tomlin said: ""Man, quarterback mobility is valuable.""

', 'Surprising name emerges as front runner for Seattle Seahawks\' QB1 role  The Seattle Seahawks have been at a crossroads as to who will be their starting quarterback next season after trading away longtime starter Russell Wilson to the Denver Broncos.  In the trade, the team acquired quarterback Drew Lock from Denver, who could never secure the starting job with the Broncos.        There are now reports that longtime Seahawks backup quarterback Geno Smith could be in line to possibly start Week One of the upcoming NFL season. Gregg Bell of the Seattle News Tribune is of the belief that Smith may have an edge on the former 2019 second-round pick out of the University of Missouri.           Seahawks offensive coordinator Shane Waldron may be the catalyst for Bell\'s report as the OC said the following recently about the battle for the starting quarterback job: ""Right now, Geno has done such a good job of carrying over (the offensive principles from 2021). He already had a head start over Drew right there.""        Smith recently signed a one-year extension with the team as well, which, at a minimum, ensures that he will be on the team for the upcoming season. Aaron Wilson@AaronWilson_NFLGeno Smith (Seahawks) refiled one-year deal, base value $3.5M, max value $7M, salary $1.26 million, Sept. 15 $585K roster bonus, $35K per game active roster bonus, $30K per game active-inactive, $500K signing bonus, $3.5M incentive playtime, playoffs, passing yards, Pro Bowl144Geno Smith (Seahawks) refiled one-year deal, base value $3.5M, max value $7M, salary $1.26 million, Sept. 15 $585K roster bonus, $35K per game active roster bonus, $30K per game active-inactive, $500K signing bonus, $3.5M incentive playtime, playoffs, passing yards, Pro Bowl Drew Lock was given every chance to be the longtime starter during his brief tenure with the Broncos. There were glimpses of the gunslinger who made a name for himself playing quarterback in the SEC (in college). But inconsistent play and turnovers allowed the Broncos to trade away Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive lineman Shelby Harris and a bevy of draft picks to acquire Russell Wilson.     Will the Seattle Seahawks make the playoffs in the upcoming season? Detroit Lions v Seattle Seahawks For better or for worse, the face of the Seattle franchise is now head coach Pete Carroll and star receiver DK Metcalf. Carroll is now the last link to the Seahawks\' glory days of making multiple Super Bowls and winning Super Bowl XLVIII. For the team to get back to the playoffs, it will take a bit of luck and winning pedigree from whoever is starting at quarterback. Without Russell Wilson, the team looks to be rebuilding.     The Seattle Seahawks also released longtime defensive stalwart Bobby Wagner, who was ultimately signed by the World Champion Los Angeles Rams. It would be pretty difficult to pencil this team in as a playoff contender in 2022 as it stands right now. OTAs are almost here and Seattle is yet to decide on who will be the starting signal caller. The team is also a member of the NFC West, which boasted three teams, the Los Angeles Rams, the Arizona Cardinals and the San Francisco 49ers, that made the 2021 playoffs. The Rams, 49ers, and Cardinals have each made offseason strides in their own right to get even better for next season. The Rams signed Wagner and receiver Allen Robinson, who is a Pro Bowl-caliber player. The Arizona Cardinals signed speedy receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown to pair with DeAndre Hopkins after he returns from a likely suspension for violating the NFL\'s Performance Enhancement Drug policy.

The two teams were involved in one of the most exciting finishes in the NFL this season in Week 8, with Denver making a furious comeback to narrowly edge out Los Angeles 31-30.  While the Broncos have played a few competitive games against some of the league’s best teams this season, they were crushed by the Buffalo Bills last Saturday by a final score of 48-19. Not much went right for them in that game, but prized free agent RB acquisition Melvin Gordon reached the end zone twice in that contest to make the score a little bit more respectable.

Even without a banner performance from WR Keenan Allen, who was nursing a hamstring injury, QB Justin Herbert was able to make it work with other complementary offensive players.  TE Hunter Henry scored his 4th touchdown of the season against the Raiders, and may be relied on heavily if Allen is not able to suit up for the Broncos tilt.

Broncos QB Drew Lock has shown signs of promise, and has a deep receiving corps that is developing along with the second-year passer.  WR’s Tim Patrick, Jerry Jeudy and K.J. Hamler all have the potential to explode any given week, and considering their familiarity with the Chargers, it’s a good bet that one or two of those players score this week. Herbert played well enough to win the game in Week 8, and given his steady play over most of the season, figures to excel against Denver in round two. His game-winning quarterback sneak against the Raiders was a building block for his confidence, which should extend into this game, and give Los Angeles a slight edge in this contest.Prediction: Chargers 28, Broncos 27     ', ""Seattle Seahawks vs. Chicago Bears: Odds, Preview, & Prediction | NFL Preseason 2022  The Seattle Seahawks will play host to the Chicago Bears to kick off the second week of the NFL Preseason.

TOMORROW: #CHIvsSEA on @espn24421Great things happen at home during the preseason. 😁📺 TOMORROW: #CHIvsSEA on @espn https://t.co/rE6If8TTz1 Seattle will put their focus on two quarterbacks in tonight's game. Geno Smith and Drew Lock will take most of, if not all, the snaps for the offensive unit tonight.

Also Checkout:- Bears Preseason Schedule The defense will look to do much better than last week, where the Steelers hung 32 points on them. Look for the defense to buckle their chinstraps and prepare for a physical gameplan from the Bears. A player to look out for is Deejay Dallas, who had an excellent performance last week. Look for the motivated Seattle squad to perform well in front of their home crowd. Chicago Bears preview Chicago Bears@ChicagoBearsGettin’ set for those Thursday night lights14318Gettin’ set for those Thursday night lights The Chicago Bears are in a completely different situation regarding the quarterback position. Justin Fields is their starter and the hopeful future of the franchise. He should make a small appearance in this game, but it should be brief as they don't want to risk a freak injury.     The Bears offense will look to run the ball effectively behind Khalil Herbert, who had an excellent breakout season last year. The Bears defense played well in the second half last week, but the Chiefs starters had a lot of success. Look for the Bears defense to struggle against two motivated quarterbacks competing for the starting spot. The key to victory for the Bears is to keep this a low-scoring affair and be effective in the run game.

"", ""3 observations from Denver Broncos vs Seattle Seahawks  The Denver Broncos once again had a strong offensive showing in the preseason, winning 30-3 against the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday.  Perhaps the most important thing to happen over the course of the game was the fact that it became clear who should be the starting quarterback for the Broncos. If everything was pointing to the battle being very tight, Saturday's game made it clear that the competition has a winner.        On that note, here are three key observations after the Broncos-Seahawks game:           #1 It's Teddy's team If the quarterback battle was tight, Bridgewater's performance on Saturday all but helped him lock his spot as the Broncos' starter for week 1. With so much talent along the offense, Bridgewater doesn't really need to elevate the group so much but execute it well, and that's exactly what he's doing to show Vic Fangio that he should be the starter. Teddy Bridgewater’s preseason line to date:16-of-19 (84.2 pct.)179 yards9.42 YPA2 TD passes0 INTRating: 141.0Drive results:FGTDTDTDPoints per possession: 6.0 (!)— Andrew Mason (@MaseDenver) August 22, 2021     Bridgewater completed nine passes out of 11 attempts, threw a touchdown and seemed much more comfortable than Lock, his opponent for the starting job. He's also more experienced, and has at least proven himself capable of taking a team to the playoffs. When week 1 arrives, Bridgewater will be QB1.  #2 Seahawks' revamped pass rush makes this team a threat Denver Broncos vs Seattle Seahawks Seattle did a good job fixing one of the team's main weaknesses this past offseason, as the pass rush now can actually pressure opposing quarterbacks and not rely on Jamal Adams to do so.     Two sacks isn't a huge number by any means, but the pressure was there all night long, and both Teddy Bridgewater and Drew Lock had problems dealing with the Seahawks' defense. Yes, Denver's offensive line is not an amazing group, but they still would have won this matchup fairly easily last year. But not in 2021.  #3 Seahawks got what they paid for in the secondary Shaquil Griffin is not a superstar, but he's still a solid corner to play in the league, and he was the best cornerback in the Seahawks' roster over the last couple of years. DK Metcalf vs starting CB Ahkello Witherspoon. Metcalf wins. From Russell Wilson. #Seahawks \u2066@thenewstribune\u2069 pic.twitter.com/vi11aMN5sf— Gregg Bell (@gbellseattle) August 18, 2021     Seattle chose to let him hit the market and try to fix the position with band-aids, and the result was exactly what one would expect when Ahkello Witherspoon is your CB1. He suffered in coverage against Jerry Jeudy, and after four uninspiring years with the San Francisco 49ers, there's not much to be excited about with the prospect of him being the main cornerback for the Seattle Seahawks.

9,Deshaun Watson,"[""NFL fans on Deshaun Watson and his performance versus the Jaguars  Deshaun Watson was seen in an NFL game for the first time since the 2020 season. His last game was against the Tennessee Titans in Week 17 for the Houston Texans.  Even though it was a preseason game, he saw himself on the field versus the Jacksonville Jaguars as a member of the Cleveland Browns. In a couple of drives with the offense, you could clearly see some rust as he struggled against the Jaguars defense.        NFL fans took notice and headed to Reddit to share their thoughts on his performance in the matchup. Here are the top comments:                           NFL fans also called out the Browns for being the Browns:     Warning: NSFW language              Other fans are mentioning former Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield, who was traded to the Carolina Panthers:              In the game versus the Jaguars, he went one-for-five passing, throwing for just seven yards. The lone completion came on the first play of the Browns' third possession. Watson hit tight end David Njoku on a short pass. Following the 24 -14 victory over Jacksonville, Cleveland head coach Kevin Stefanski spoke on the quarterback's effort:     “I think it was important for him to get out there, in a game setting, under the lights with new teammates and go operate... It wasn’t going to be perfect and even if it was perfect, you can’t overreact to that either. I think it was all part of the progression for him.” Also Checkout:- Jaguars Preseason Schedule        As mentioned earlier, Watson was last seen versus the Titans back in the 2020 season. In that Week 17 matchup, he threw for 365 yards with three touchdowns and an interception. That season, he led the NFL in passing yards with 4,823 yards and was tied for seventh with 33 touchdown passes. After sitting out last season, will we see the 26-year-old play in a regular season game in 2022 for Cleveland?  Will Deshaun Watson play for the Cleveland Browns in the 2022 regular season? Cleveland Browns Training Camp     After Watson received a six-game suspension for breaching the league's personal conduct policy, the NFL decided to appeal the suspension. Peter C. Harvey will hear the appeal, rather than Commissioner Roger Goodell. The NFL wanted a year-long suspension for the quarterback from the very beginning, and the appeal was no surprise. Despite Watson reaching a settlement with all but one of the plaintiffs accusing him of sexual misconduct, the league hasn't changed its mind. They are reportedly pushing for an indefinite suspension.        For the three-time Pro Bowler, the chances of seeing him play a down in the regular season could be very slim. However, players are normally allowed to play while their appeal is in process. If the appeal takes a long time, as everything in this case so far has, he could play in the opening week of the season.We'll have to wait and see what happens with his appeal.If you use any of the above quotes, please H/T Sportskeeda.

', ""Deshaun Watson delivers another subpar performance as Browns waste another season  The Cleveland Browns made arguably the most polarizing move of 2022 this past offseason by trading for and signing Deshaun Watson to a fully-guaranteed $230 million deal. This was supposed to take the team into a new stratosphere, where they are perennial contenders.  Yet the 11-game suspension handed down to the quarterback put those plans in jeopardy for the 2022 season. Jacoby Brissett did play admirably, however, and Watson returned with the Browns at 4-7. If he could return a hero and win out, the season would not be a waste. Instead, he had another rough performance Sunday as another season appears to be down the drain in Cleveland.

Yet again, Watson was shaky and a horrific interception summed up his day in the 23-10 defeat to drop the team to 5-8 and realistically out of the playoff race. 26/42 for 276 yards and a touchdown is not terrible, but he did nothing to take his offense to the next level as he was signed to do.     Patient Browns fans will claim this was always part of the plan. The quarterback would return and use the final six games of the season to prepare for 2023.  The problem is that time moves quickly in the NFL. Players like Myles Garrett, Nick Chubb, Denzel Ward, and many others will be another year older next season. Primes are potentially being wasted when such a project is not necessary for the franchise. The $230 million man should indeed return in 2023 much better than he is now, given he will have a normal offseason of preparation. But will this roster be this stacked? The team is already without a first-round pick, and free agents may want to avoid Cleveland if they believe a coaching change is on the horizon.

However, all NFL fans know that organizations are impatient. While the Browns focus on being patient, teams like the Buffalo Bills, Kansas City Chiefs, Miami Dolphins, Cincinnati Bengals, and several others continue to improve. And that's just in the AFC.The Browns are falling behind and anything other than a dominant start from Watson to open the 2023 season may signal major changes coming in Cleveland.

', 'Kevin Stefanski delivers update on Deshaun Watson after Browns\' QB’s disappointing season  Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson is coming off a disappointing season. He played only six games last season due to his suspension, and in those games, the Browns quarterback looked rusty.  Watson\'s dip in performance was predictable since he was away from the game for a long time, but the quarterback would love to get back to how he played with the Houston Texans.        Watson has put in a lot of work during the offseason, and according to his head coach, Kevin Stefanski he is looking pretty good in the OTAs. Here\'s what he said about his quarterback:           ""He\'s done a really nice job throughout this entire offseason of being diligent about understanding playbook, understanding his teammates every single day."" ""There are always going to be things that you want to get back and do a little bit differently."" He said. ""That\'s no different than every player at every position, but he\'s right where he needs to be."" In six games that he played last season, Watson had a passer rating of 79.1 with 1,102 yards, seven touchdowns, and five interceptions. This output was extremely disappointing considering how much the Cleveland Browns spent to acquire him. Hopefully, Watson will be able to rediscover himself next season, as he has got a full offseason to work with the franchise in full capacity, unlike last season.      Deshaun Watson is looking to reunite with DeAndre Hopkins Deshaun Watson and DeAndre Hopkins: Houston Texans v Tampa Bay Buccaneers DeAndre Hopkins was released by the Arizona Cardinals last week. He is now a free agent and multiple teams are interested in him. Deshaun Watson has also shown interest in playing with Hopkins, and the possibility of a reunion of the two is open. Watson played with Hopkins for the Houston Texans, and they were among the best QB-WR duos during that time. They made each other better, which is why this move would make a lot of sense for both parties.     While playing with Hopkins in Houston, Watson had a passer rating of 101.0 with 9,716 yards, 71 touchdowns, and 29 interceptions in 38 games. These numbers show how great the pairing could be in Cleveland, which is why the franchise should look to aggressively pursue the former Cardinals receiver.If the Browns manage to sign Hopkins, there will be no denying their status as a legitimate Super Bowl contender in the upcoming season.     ', 'Deshaun Watson Fantasy Outlook: Is the Browns QB starting Week 13?  Deshaun Watson will make his first appearance of the 2022 campaign against his old team, the Houston Texans, after being reinstated by the Cleveland Browns. According to statistics, Watson has consistently ranked among the top fantasy quarterbacks in NFL history.  Deshaun Watson hasn\'t participated in a league game in almost two years. The talented quarterback missed the entire 2021 season after playing the final few games of the 2020 campaign with the Houston Texans.

He is slated to start Sunday vs. the Texans.11015869Browns officially added Deshaun Watson to their 53-man roster today. He is slated to start Sunday vs. the Texans.           Watson can go up the priority list if he is still available and you need a QB. After being officially cleared on Monday, Watson will make his first appearance this Sunday. Given the circumstances and the fact that he hasn\'t featured since 2020, optimists should keep their hopes in check for his first match back. But as the season progresses, Watson might offer marginal QB1 value for fantasy.  Deshaun Watson\'s fantasy potential Deshaun Watson was performing at a high level the last time he played, but it\'s difficult to predict how he\'ll slot in with the Browns. Experienced backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett filled in for the Browns during Watson\'s 11-game suspension, but his performance was pedestrian. He has a 64.1% completion rate, 12 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.     Watson should be added to fantasy football rosters. However, it would be wise to wait until after his performance in his first match back before using him in the starting lineup. This season, the Texans have surprised many by playing well against quarterbacks. Only the Philadelphia Eagles and Denver Broncos have given up fewer points to quarterbacks than the Texans.

""This defense"" refers to the unit\'s performance on Saturday in a dominant 13-3 victory over the Baltimore Ravens.  Tyler Huntley was in at quarterback for the Ravens and was harassed all day, taking three sacks and plenty of hits in snowy conditions in Cleveland. On a day when the offense only mustered 13 points, the defense saved the day.        Yet the win only pushed the team to a 6-8 record and time is running out in the playoff race. Unfortunately, things are clicking in this season way too late.           The Browns defense has too many regrets in 2022 Baltimore Ravens v Cleveland Browns The plan heading into 2022 was to hover around the .500 mark until Deshaun Watson could return. That meant the defense was set to play a big role if the team was going to make the postseason. Instead, they allowed 30 points or more in five games, including a disastrous Week 2 collapse against the New York Jets.     Cleveland Browns@BrownsJORDAN GOT : #BALvsCLE on NFLN: Stream on NFL+19824JORDAN GOT 🆙📺: #BALvsCLE on NFLN📱: Stream on NFL+ https://t.co/uyjBamK0GI Fans have been calling for the team to fire defensive coordinator Joe Woods for weeks, only for his group to finally come alive about a week before Christmas. A win to get to 6-8 does keep slim playoff hopes alive, but more than anything, the team is seeking positives heading into 2023. Players and coaches alike are fighting for their jobs and holding a Ravens team to three points is impressive, even when considering the fact Lamar Jackson was out.     The key now is to keep up this performance next week against a New Orleans Saints team without a solid option at quarterback. This defense has too much talent to falter against subpar talent in the quarterback position. The Browns are a team that will be led by Watson for years to come. It appears his presence has given the defense a boost as well. Whether that carries over into the next three games remains to be seen. If it does, the defense can put the early-season woes behind it and focus on a new identity in 2023. Cleveland Browns@BrownsTook care of business.

Next up, Christmas Eve game!@deshaunwatson | #Browns https://t.co/eJb6W5S0pu The front office in Cleveland must also avoid getting too caught up in game-to-game performances, instead focusing on the season as a whole. That means changes will surely come in 2023, with a focus on plugging holes throughout the unit. While the Ravens only scored three points, J.K. Dobbins ran all over the Browns with 125 yards on 13 carries. That number should be seen as a massive concern once the thrill of the victory wears off.

Yet the 13-3 victory did not exactly feature a legendary performance from the quarterback. He finished 18/28 for 161 yards and threw for the only touchdown in the game.

Yet the weather was freezing, and most importantly, he did not turn the ball over like he did in his first two games back. Just getting wins will endear him to the fanbase at this point. The problem is that below-average performances from him could mean another losing record if this carries over into 2023. Jacoby Brissett provided admirable quarterback play in the first 11 games of the year, and because of defensive woes, the team had a 4-7 record.     If the defense does not improve, Watson may have to play at a Pro Bowl level just to have the Browns in contention in the division. And that is assuming a return to that level of play is still possible for him after his long absence.

10,Ben Roethlisberger,"[""Kenny Pickett's performance proves Steelers have a potential answer but not solution for Ben Roethlisberger's replacement  Kenny Pickett was selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was the organization's choice to take over as their future franchise quarterback following the retirement of Ben Roethlisberger during the 2022 NFL offseason. Roethlisberger retired after spending his entire 18 year career with the Steelers.  While Pickett would be tasked with filling big shoes, he didn't open the season as the starting quarterback. Instead, the Steelers named Mitchell Trubisky the Week 1 starter after signing him during the 2022 free agency period.        Trubisky struggled in his short time as the starting quarterback for the Steelers, losing two of his first three games. He entered a favorable match-up at home in Week 4 against the New York Jets, but failed to impress. By the end of the first half, the Steelers were trailing by a 10-6 score. This triggered head coach Mike Tomlin to make a change, bringing in rookie Kenny Pickett to replace Trubisky.           Pickett's NFL career got off to the roughest of starts as he threw an interception on his very first passing attempt ever. He would go on to complete ten of his 13 passing attempts for 120 yards, but all three of his incompletions were intercepted by the Jets defense. On a more positive note, Pickett recorded two rushing touchdowns. Dov Kleiman@NFL_DovKleimanThat was quick... Kenny Pickett throws an INT on his first drive in the NFL Was his first pass in the NFL.38362That was quick... Kenny Pickett throws an INT on his first drive in the NFL Was his first pass in the NFL.https://t.co/Sxvi9vsWsy     It was a mixed performance for Pickett, who failed to complete the comeback against the Jets. Instead, the Steelers lost their third consecutive game. While it was only one half, Pickett will need to play much better moving forward. Especially if he's going to follow in Ben Roethlisberger's footsteps, which include two Super Bowl rings.     It's unclear at this point if Kenny Pickett will be named the starting quarterback moving forward or if the Steelers will give Trubisky another shot first, but an announcement by Mike Tomlin can be expected sometime prior to the Week 5 game. It will be a tough task for whoever gets named the starter, facing off against the Buffalo Bills, one of the best teams in the NFL with the top-ranked defense from a season ago.     Which teams passed on Kenny Pickett? Pittsburgh QB Kenny Pickett Pickett was the only quarterback selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft, going to the Steelers with the 20th overall pick. Several teams ahead of the Steelers in the draft order were rumored to be interested in drafting a quarterback in the first round, but ultimately decided to pass on Pickett.         The Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, and Seattle Seahawks all decided to pass on quarterbacks, filling other roster needs instead. Other teams that passed on Pickett in the first round drafted quarterbacks later. These were the Atlanta Falcons (Desmond Ridder), the Carolina Panthers (Matt Corral), and the Washington Commanders (Sam Howell). The Tennessee Titans also decided to take a quarterback later in the draft when Malik Willis fell to them in the third round. They weren't necessarily in the market for one, so didn't really pass on Pickett, but capitalized on drafting Willis for value where they got him. The New England Patriots similarly drafted Bailey Zappe in the fourth round, before a trio of speculative quarterbacks were selected late in the seventh round. Does Kenny Pickett really have small hands? Kenny Pickett at the 2022 NFL Combine     Kenny Pickett's hands measured in at just 8.5 inches during the 2022 NFL Combine. He officially has the smallest hands of any quarterback currently playing in the NFL, making his grip on the football a potential issue moving forward. While his hands are extremely small compared to other NFL quarterbacks, it's debatable how much of an impact that really has on a player's abilities. It's certain that the Steelers would have drafted him if they had any concerns about this. They scouted him thoroughly and would have watched endless tape of his college days before reaching a decision.It was great to see the rookie get on the field, although his debut didn't quite go to plan. We will see him develop and perhaps start some games in the near future.

But through two weeks of the NFL season, Roethlisberger has faced significant pressure from opposing defenses.  On Tuesday morning, Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin spoke to the media during his weekly press conference and highlighted not just the offensive line but also Roethlisberger\'s apparent injury status.

In 2020, Roethlisberger missed an entire week of practice when he was considered a close contact of former tight end Vance McDonald, who has tested positive for COVID-19. When Roethlisberger returned in time for the game, ironically against the Bengals, it was his best performance all season long. So there might not be reason for concern when considering Roethlisberger\'s preparation. Tomlin also said that the team as a whole has to be ready for anything. Could that mean Tomlin would consider starting a backup quarterback or just a change from aggressive passing to aggressive rushing? Either way, the Steelers offensive line will need to be ready.

After the Steelers' loss to the Browns, many questioned whether Ben would return. If the Steelers lost to any other NFL team, Roethlisberger would be shooting 18 holes of golf right now.  With the Steelers losing to their biggest rival, the Cleveland Browns, Big Ben went into the offseason ready to change. The two-time Super Bowl champion dedicated his offseason to his diet. That loss to Cleveland left a sour taste in Roethlisberger's mouth and made him feel like he had something to prove.        The 39-year-old veteran quarterback shined during his preseason game against the Detroit Lions on Saturday night. Here are three observations from Roethlisberger's massive night.            Pittsburgh Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger showed flashes of the old Big Ben #1 Ben Roethlisberger looked phenomenal in the Steelers new offense The Pittsburgh Steelers offense will be working under newly hired offensive coordinator Matt Canada. Ben Roethlisberger shined in the Steelers' new offensive system on Saturday night, putting on a vintage performance against the Detroit Lions in his limited time on the field.

The Steelers could be the team to watch this season.  #2 Ben Roethlisberger relied heavily on his tight ends Eric Ebron and Pat Freiermuth looked great against the Detroit Lions. Ebron caught four passes for 59 yards. Freiermuth caught two passes for 19 yards and two touchdowns.     Pat Freiermuth so far:🔸2 catches🔸2 TDs New TE1 in Pittsburgh is making PLAYS 🔥pic.twitter.com/c0LvmsIR5t— PFF (@PFF) August 22, 2021 Roethlisberger targeted Ebron and Freiermuth a total of nine times during his preseason debut. The tight-end duo caught six of the nine targets. That much production out of the two tight ends will give the Steelers a different look this season.  #3 Ben Roethlisberger proved that Matt Canada's offense would work Roethlisberger completed eight of his ten passes for 137 passing yards and two touchdowns against the Lions. Altogether, the Steelers' quarterbacks played above expectations. Big Ben's backup Mason Rudolph threw for 138 passing yards while completing 13 of his 18 passes.     It was easy to see that Ben Roethlisberger was playing like a man that had something to prove. The Steelers should feel optimistic about Roethlisberger's performance.

In a winner-take-all showdown to crown a champion, it provides opportunities for players to become legends, especially quarterbacks. Unfortunately, there have been many times where a quarterback has failed to perform on the grand stage. Here are the five worst games by a quarterback in Super Bowl history.  Worst performances by a quarterback in Super Bowl history        #1 - Craig Morton, Denver Broncos - SB XII           Quarterback Craig Morton playing for the Denver Broncos (Image Credit; Getty Images) Craig Morton had the worst performance of all time in the big game against the Dallas Cowboys. He completed just four of his 15 pass attempts for 39 yards and four interceptions.

Collins completed just 15 of his 39 passes for 112 yards while throwing four interceptions. He was only able to account for 28 yards in the entire second half of the game. The Ravens had an excellent defense, but Collins' performance was unacceptable.     Worst quarterback performances in Super Bowl history Here are the worst games ever recorded by a quarterback in the history of the Super Bowl. #3 - Rich Gannon, Oakland Raiders - SB XXXVII Oakland Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon Rich Gannon holds the Super Bowl record with five interceptions in a single game. Three of the five interceptions were returned for touchdowns by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defense, another all-time record in the game. The Raiders were destroyed by a 48-21 score in a blowout from start to finish.     #4 - Ben Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh Steelers - SB XL Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger The strange part about Ben Roethlisberger making this list is that the Pittsburgh Steelers won the game against the Seattle Seahawks by a 21-10 score.

But making it to another postseason is an achievement in itself after such a difficult season in which his quarterback play left a lot to be desired.With Big Ben now no longer a Steeler, attention will turn to who his successor will be.

On Wednesday morning, Roethlisberger compared Sunday\'s loss to bubble gum that has been chewed and spit out. So, the NFL veteran won\'t be making any comments about the game because, like bubble gum, it has been spit out. During their heroic performance last Sunday night against the Los Angeles Chargers, a the Steelers comeback was thwarted. Roethlisberger went on to have his worst performance of the season, thus far, on the road against the Bengals. He was just 24 for 41 on completed passes and threw for 263 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. Defensive leaders T.J.

He was the quarterback for the Steelers from 2004 until then. Following his retirement, the Steelers brought in former Chicago Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and also drafted Kenny Pickett. Trubisky was given the nod ahead of rookie Pickett to start the season as the starting quarterback for the franchise.  The Steelers won their opening game against the Cincinnati Bengals with Trubisky under center. However, the offense was not inspiring and then the Week 2 loss against the New England Patriots was very disappointing. The Steelers fans present at the stadium booed quarterback Trubisky and gave an indication that they already want local boy Kenny Pickett as the team\'s quarterback.

He condemned them and hopes for better treatment from them for the quarterback. Here\'s what Roethlisberger had to say about the situation: ""I don\'t think it is fair that it happened to Mitch because I wouldn\'t blame Mitch for the performance. I don\'t think that he deserved the fans getting on him. I hate it for Mitch because I don\'t think it\'s fair.""

However, if his performances don\'t improve, we will see Pickett making his NFL debut sooner rather than later.          Are the Pittsburgh Steelers a better team without Ben Roethlisberger? New England Patriots v Pittsburgh Steelers Ben Roethlisberger is an NFL legend, having led the Steelers to two Super Bowl victories. But in recent years, as he aged, his performances declined, and the Steelers slowed down to a degree. With two much younger quarterbacks in the form of Mitchell Trubisky and Kenny Pickett, the Steelers\' offense has a new dynamism. When necessary, they can run the ball with their quarterback. With a mobile quarterback, coach Mike Tomlin can work wonders, just as he did in Roethlisberger\'s early years.     A lot of Steelers fans think the playcalling has to change. They are frustrated with the lack of innovation and passes thrown down the field. Offensive coordinator Matt Canada may have to be more aggressive to give Pittsburgh a better chance at winning.    It\'s unclear at this point whether Trubisky or Pickett is the Steelers\' long-term solution at quarterback. The current Steelers roster is on par or slightly better than last year\'s, giving them another shot at a Wild Card berth in the playoffs.     It will be interesting to see who ends the season as the Steelers quarterback. The pressure is mounting on Trubisky with Pickett waiting for his chance.If you use any quotes, please credit the Footbahlin podcast and H/T Sportskeeda     ', 'Watch: Ben Roethlisberger in tears after Baltimore Ravens win  Ben Roethlisberger led the Pittsburgh Steelers to a courageous comeback Sunday over the rival Baltimore Ravens.

11,Sam Darnold,"['NFL 2020: New York Jets stay winless after Sam Darnold\'s poor performance  Things just keep getting worse for the New York Jets.  The team at the bottom of everyone\'s NFL power ranking fell to 0-7 with Sunday\'s 18-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills. The Jets are the league\'s only winless team, and the two people taking the most heat for that are head coach Adam Gase and quarterback Sam Darnold.        The No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Darnold has not lived up to expectations by any measure. There are other young QBs who are surrounded by teams with talent deficiencies -- Joe Burrow (Bengals), Justin Herbert (Chargers) and Daniel Jones (Giants) come to mind -- but they\'re doing better individually than Darnold.           On Sunday, Darnold completed 12 of 23 passes for 120 yards, with no touchdowns and two interceptions. His Quarterback Rating was 17.6 (out of a possible 100) and his Passer Rating was 31.1 (out of a possible 158.3).

The Jets\' offensive line was called out by Gase. ""It was collapsing quick on him,"" the coach was quoted by ESPN,"" noting that Darnold ""didn\'t have a lot of time to throw the ball."" Gase added, ""If you look at it statistically, we\'re not good anywhere statistically."" Can the Jets continue with Adam Gase and Sam Darnold? Some of the blame for that has to go to Gase. He\'s the one who played a big hand in the Jets getting rid of All-Pro running back Le\'Veon Bell a couple weeks ago. Bell was signed by the Jets last year and made the highest-paid running back in the NFL. But Gase reportedly never wanted Bell on the team and couldn\'t figure out how to best use the talented runner.     Any time, any place.@LeVeonBell is ready to ball. pic.twitter.com/w6MLLizWap— New York Jets (@nyjets) January 31, 2020 Gase came to New York with a reputation as a quarterback guru and offensive genius. But now in his second season with the team, the Jets have the NFL\'s worst offense and their franchise QB is failing. No one would be surprised if the Jets fire Gase at the end of this season. If they are bad enough to land the No. 1 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, no one would be surprised if they use that pick on another quarterback -- probably Clemson\'s Trevor Lawrence -- and put the Darnold era behind them.     Before that, these Jets just need to get a win (or two).This week doesn\'t look good for that, as they face the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs on the road.After that, however, the Jets have three straight winnable games against the New England Patriots, Los Angeles Chargers and Miami Dolphins.

The New York Jets will receive:         2021 Sixth-round pick (No.226 overall)· 2022 Second-round pick· 2022 fourth-round pick.           Sources: The #Panthers have traded for #Jets QB Sam Darnold.— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) April 5, 2021 According to Jonathan Jones of CBS Sports, Carolina will exercise the fifth-year option on Darnold’s rookie contract. Darnold’s fifth-year salary would be $18.9 million, per spotrac.  The 23-year-old has spent the first three seasons of his NFL career with the Jets. Sam Darnold showed potential in his first two seasons, but regressed in 2020, ranking bottom or close to bottom in every major statistical category for QBs. Darnold’s performance in 2020 was one of the reasons why the Jets were trending toward a 0-16 season. But the team managed to score a couple of victories towards the end of the season, much to the ire of New York Jets fans.      Midway through the season, the Jets fans were hoping that the team would finish with the worst record in the league and secure the #1 pick and draft Clemson QB Trevor Lawrence. But those two wins pushed the Jets below the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2021 NFL draft order. The team is still expected to draft a QB with the second pick in the draft.  NFL Trade: Sam Darnold traded to Carolina Panthers Sam Darnold was the top QB prospect in the 2018 NFL draft. Most NFL scouts expected him to be the the player that turns the Jets' fortunes around.  While Darnold's NFL career hasn't panned out as many expected, there is optimism that it can be salvaged. He doesn’t turn 24 until June and has spent his career saddled with arguably the weakest roster in the NFL.  pic.twitter.com/Z1GYeszI4b— Carolina Panthers (@Panthers) April 5, 2021     The Carolina Panthers see Darnold as a distressed asset who could thrive under coach Matt Rhule. QB Teddy Bridgewater underperformed last season with a strong cast of talent around him, and Sam Darnold could be a better long-term option for the team.For the Panthers, the trade was worth the punt. They did not give up much to acquire the QB and if it doesn't work out, they can trade him at the end of the 2021 season or release him the year after. Unsure about a trade offer?

Darnold is about to enter his fifth season in the NFL, and thus far, he has been anything but impressive. He finished last season with a 4-7 record in 11 starts and a total QBR of 33.2, only finishing ahead of rookies Justin Fields and Zach Wilson among qualified signal callers. Darnold\'s best season in terms of QBR was in his rookie year, when he finished with a score of 45.9 and was still just good enough for 29th out of 33 qualified quarterbacks.     And yet, teams are still struggling with the idea that it may be too early to give up on him completely. He IS just 24 years old. Then again, so is Kyler Murray. If not Sam Darnold, then who? The Panthers are clearly unhappy with Darnold\'s performance. It\'s part of the reason they attempted to revive Cam Newton\'s career late last season. That made the idea of McAdoo confirming Darnold as the starting QB all the more strange. Moments later, when he walked back those comments, speculation began again surrounding who the Panthers might potentially target instead.

With the NFL draft just eight days away, it seems like no one really knows who\'s going to be behind center for the Panthers next year, not even the OC.     ', 'NFL analyst on Panthers QB competition between Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnold  The Carolina Panthers were in the market for a quarterback and traded for Baker Mayfield this offseason. They sent the Cleveland Browns a conditional fifth-round pick in the 2024 draft in return.   Carolina will enter training camp with two of the top three picks from the 2018 NFL Draft. Mayfield was selected by the Browns first overall and Sam Darnold was taken third by the New York Jets.        The trade has been well received by the majority of NFL fans, with most thinking it will work out well for both Mayfield and Carolina. But not everyone sees it as a net positive for the Panthers.           On The Ringer NFL Podcast, analyst Roger Sherman said that the quarterback battle between Mayfield and Darnold hurts his soul. “There are only a handful of actual legit quarterback battles and to be far and away the one that just hurts me in my soul the most is the Carolina Panthers."" He continued: ""Those two guys who were, just a few years ago, hot NFL draft prospects that went number one and number three picks back in 2018.”        Sherman thinks that Mayfield will likely win the starting job over Darnold. “One will be a backup to the other most likely Sam Darnold. Because Sam Darnold is like legit really bad and Baker Mayfield is just kind of, like not good for having been a number one pick. It\'s probably going to be Baker over Sam.” He concluded by saying: ""Unless something weird happens, it\'s just bad vibes for everybody involved."" Mayfield started 59 games in four seasons with the Browns, throwing for 14,125 yards, 92 touchdowns and 56 interceptions. He finished second in the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year voting in his rookie season and led the Browns to their first postseason win of the millennium.

Oklahoma Spring Game This quarterback race may not be as riveting as some others across the NFL, as it seems that Mayfield has the edge over Darnold. Darnold started 11 games for the Panthers last season but suffered a cracked scapula in his throwing arm, missing six games. He threw nine touchdown passes and 13 interceptions.        Mayfield has more career starts under his belt than Darnold and has shown that he could be a viable starter in the NFL. Most are expecting Baker Mayfield to be the starting quarterback for the franchise in 2022. This is unless injury, or Sam Darnold\'s performance, forces him to the sidelines.

The New York Giants eventually won 25-3 primarily due to six sacks, an interception from the defense and a solid performance from the offense.           Before being benched, Sam Darnold was 16/25 for 111 yards and an interception. His fantasy football score at the end of the game was -.06 points. The quarterback, who started off the season with four straight games with at least 18 fantasy football points, ended with negative points. It also happened against a defense ranked poorly against the pass. Antwan V. Staley@antwanstaleySam Darnold with intention grounding and that’s a safety. 🤦🏾\u200d♂️1:43 AM · Oct 24, 2021678Sam Darnold with intention grounding and that’s a safety. 🤦🏾\u200d♂️ https://t.co/LfaT3iV2yS     Head coach Matt Rhule has stated Sam Darnold remains the starter going forward, but should Darnold be a starter in fantasy football? His next matchups include the Atlanta Falcons (14th against the pass), New England Patriots (16th), Arizona Cardinals (6th) and Washington (32nd). When it comes to fantasy football, the win doesn't matter as much as the stats. However, Carolina's weak schedule has helped turn Sam Darnold into a streaming QB1 early in the season. The four teams the Panthers faced in their first four games are currently ranked in the bottom half of the league against the pass.  Fantasy football owners took advantage of the matchups for several weeks but are now facing reality. Darnold is a good, not great, or consistent quarterback. He will likely be seen as a low-end QB2 if someone needs a quarterback from their bench with their starters on a bye. Steve Reed@SteveReedAPPanthers with Christian McCaffrey: 3-0.Panthers without Christian McCaffrey: 0-4.4:07 AM · Oct 24, 2021237Panthers with Christian McCaffrey: 3-0.Panthers without Christian McCaffrey: 0-4.     Christian McCaffrey can come off IR for Week 9 and negatively affect Sam Darnold's fantasy football value. When most teams are playing from behind, they pass the ball, but Carolina looks towards McCaffrey.  McCaffrey's absence has allowed Darnold and the passing game to take control, but it has been a struggle for three straight weeks now. Sam Darnold had under six fantasy football points against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 5 (177 yards, 1 TD, 3 INT, ten rushing yards) and 11 fantasy football points against the Minnesota Vikings last week (207 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT, 48 rushing yards).  His stock has been trending downwards for three weeks and there is no chance of shooting upwards again anytime soon. So what is the final verdict if you have Sam Darnold in your fantasy football lineup?  The best option is to let him fall to your bench if you have the space for him. There's a chance he will be able to work with Matt Rhule to turn around their offense, but don't bank your season on him in standard fantasy football leagues. Darnold is still young enough to turn his career around for the better and is worth stashing in a keeper league. But he will have to regain some confidence on the field over the next few weeks, which could result in poor showings in fantasy football.     "", 'Report reveals Browns player was unhappy with Baker Mayfield\'s poor performance in training  Baker Mayfield is currently facing a battle for his NFL future, which lies in limbo. He remains on the Cleveland Browns\' roster despite the franchise making it abundantly clear they will be moving forward with Deshaun Watson as their starting quarterback.  A recent report has questioned Mayfield\'s ability and that he was regularly poor in practice, according to an unnamed Browns player. The information contained a quote from a Browns player. The statement addresses a video Odell Beckham Jr.\'s father released on social media in November last year, showing the quarterback not throwing the ball to his son, who was open on several occasions.                View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post           According to the report, when asked if he had seen the video posted by Beckham Jr.\'s father, the unnamed Browns player gave a scathing response. He said: ""Why would I watch the video? I see it every day in practice."" Offseason Chopz@Pchopz_Oh boy.3417478Oh boy. https://t.co/edYCPG2S1j     This is another negative view that could hinder Mayfield\'s search for a new team. With the NFL Draft ending, the chance for the Browns to move him on to pastures new and focus on the future with a different quarterback have also diminished. The Carolina Panthers were interested in Mayfield, but recent reports have shown that they were never close to a deal with the Browns. The Panthers went on to draft Matt Corral, who will challenge Sam Darnold for the starting job in Charlotte.        Other potential teams that needed a quarterback have made moves to find the piece to the puzzle, with the Pittsburgh Steelers drafting Kenny Pickett and the Seattle Seahawks set to move forward with Drew Lock behind center. Seattle head coach Pete Carroll recently stated that the Seahawks weren\'t looking to add another quarterback \'at all\' to their roster, which puts an end to Seattle being a possible destination for Mayfield.  Why are teams reluctant to make a trade for Baker Mayfield? One of the main hurdles is the quarterback\'s $19 million salary due in 2022. Teams seem reluctant to take on that amount, which reportedly led to the Panthers\' and Browns\' inability to agree on trade terms.   It also seems highly unlikely that Mayfield will stay and offer back-up for Watson as he sees himself as the starting quarterback. Based on the NFL Index quarterback rankings, he ranked 25th out of 62 quarterbacks, with his inconsistency proving to be a significant shortcoming.     ', 'Patrick Mahomes analyzes performances through first 6 games of 2021 NFL season  For Patrick Mahomes, the 2021 NFL season has been a trying one. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback has thrown eight interceptions in just six games. That\'s more than the six he threw in 2020 and the five he threw in 2019.  The Chiefs have a 3-3 record and are hoping Mahomes can recover from his setbacks. Patrick Mahomes seems to have the right attitude towards his play.         He spoke with the media about his turnover struggles and gave insight into how he\'s handling them.

When asked about his interceptions, Patrick Mahomes said, “I think as an offense, especially for me [I need to] just to stop hurting myself.” Just stay within the reads, stay true to the reads and when it broke down, got out of the pocket and tried to make plays happen. Pretty much just staying true to who I am and not try to do too much and kind of relied on the other guys to make plays and they did.”     Mahomes admits he\'s the one who needs to stop hurting himself on plays. Since entering the league, Mahomes has been a special talent who has made some of the most absurd plays you\'ll ever see. Sometimes that desire for a big play can be to his detriment. This season, defenses have changed their approach to defending Mahomes. They have safety help in coverage on Tyreek Hill on every play. This forces Mahomes to slowly work the ball downfield and rely more on shorter completions. Patrick Mahomes has also tried to force big plays because the Chiefs feel the need to score 30 points a game to win. The defense was last in the NFL in points per game allowed before last week. Patrick Mahomes is keeping a level head and sticking to his routine When asked if the turnovers had phased him, the 2018 league MVP said,     “I mean it doesn’t really bother me that much,” Mahomes explained casually. “As long as you’re winning football games, the other stuff doesn’t matter, good or bad. I just kind of have that mindset of I’m going to do my routine, stay within my routine, focus on winning football games and after that the rest kind of handles itself.” By all accounts, it sounds like Mahomes has the right attitude. The 26-year-old has never had struggles like this in his career. But he\'s staying with the routine and mindset that\'s earned him his place in NFL history already.

', '3 potential replacements for Panthers QB Sam Darnold in 2022  The Carolina Panthers acquired quarterback Sam Darnold in the offseason via trade from the New York Jets. They believed they were getting an immediate upgrade as well as their future franchise quarterback.   That has not worked out at all in the first half of the 2021 NFL season.        Sam Darnold has been a disaster for the Panthers this year. He leads the entire NFL with 11 interceptions while ranking 29th with a 35.8 QBR.

They all throw the ball to the other team. Sam Darnold is now injured and will miss significant time in the second half of the 2021 NFL season. Given how much he struggled, it\'s possible that he could lose his starting quarterback job for the 2022 NFL season.      Here are three players who could replace him for next season. Potential replacements for Sam Darnold #1 - P.J. Walker P.J. Walker has already been named the starter for the Panthers in Week 10 against the Arizona Cardinals. It will be just the second start of his NFL career after having much success in the XFL.  A strong performance could earn him additional starts moving forward. He was the quarterback for head coach Matt Rhule at Temple University, so there is familiarity there. #2 - Cam Newton The Panthers have officially signed Cam Newton following the injury news to Sam Darnold. Cam Newton will be reunited with the organization that he had so much success with.  Walker will start in Week 10 but depending on how things play out, Newton could possibly get the start in Week 11.

He missed almost the entire 2019 season with an injury before starting for the New England Patriots in 2020, where he had mixed results.  He will look to regain his ""Superman"" form. #3 - Deshaun Watson Deshaun Watson is a possible replacement for Sam Darnold, who is not currently on the Panthers roster due to injury. There is a great chance that Watson will be traded in the offseason and the Panthers could be one of the teams interested. They inquired about the quarterback at the NFL trade deadline but ultimately passed. They could again explore trade possibilities in the offseason.

But under the right conditions. I have to sit down with my family, my counsel, and just decide. Will Cam Newton find a new team? Over the next couple of weeks, NFL teams will be evaluating their rosters and looking at where they can improve. There are several teams that could use a new quarterback, but will a 32-year-old be the answer?     Washington need a new quarterback; so do the Steelers and the Texans (if Mills is not the answer), and potentially the Seahawks, depending on what Russell Wilson does. The Panthers are still unsure over their options going forward. Sam Darnold started 3-0 this season before the wheels fell off and Cam looked shaky in the offense.

I can tell you that now.""#NFL I @wcnc I #Panthers https://t.co/o19XF7CaHm The big question will be whether Newton sees himself as a starter or if he is content being a back-up. His charisma and stature suggest he needs to be a starter, but there could be only a handful of jobs available, if any; so being a back up could be a viable option.     Since his 2015 MVP season, in which he led the Panthers to a 15-1 record and a Super Bowl appearance, Cam has been on a downwards trajectory. In his MVP year, he threw for 35 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions, but he has not gotten close to those touchdown numbers since. Several teams will see the 32-year-old as a bonafide back-up option should their starter go down. That could even be in Carolina, but the lack of on-field production will cause some hesitation. If Cam is to call it a day and retire from the league, he will go down as one of the most polarizing figures the game has seen. He made his name as one of the first dual-threat quarterbacks who could throw as well as he could run. Panthers 24/7@Panthers24_72013 Monday Night Football.

12,Carson Palmer,"['Patrick Mahomes vs Joe Burrow debate: Why Carson Palmer\'s hot take has zero substance\xa0  Every single NFL season, there is an early debate over which quarterback will challenge Patrick Mahomes as the best in the league. It\'s been Justin Herbert, Josh Allen, and right now it\'s Joe Burrow. There\'s one constant in this debate: it\'s always someone vs. Mahomes.  Since Mahomes came into the league and became a starter, he\'s been the best quarterback. He won MVP that year and has only gotten better. It\'s a hot take to say anyone is better, but that didn\'t stop Carson Palmer.        On his brother\'s podcast, he dropped one of the hottest takes in recent memory:           ""I think Joe is the best quarterback in the league. I know Patrick [Mahomes] is phenomenal, but I just think Joe’s more consistent. He’s more consistent. He’s more accountable to run the system and the play that’s called and not feel like, \'Well, he didn’t win last time and get open for me, so I’m gonna do it with my feet,\' and then before you know it, you’re sacked for a four-yard loss because you tried to make two or three guys miss.""        He finished by saying: ""Joe is just... talk about not having a weakness. Mentally strong, physically tough, accurate, can throw it far enough, fast enough, gets the ball out quick, and then he can actually do a lot with his legs."" For a lot of reasons, this take is just wrong. Palmer is a former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback, so he is probably a little partial to the current Bengals quarterback, but if he\'s portending to be an analyst, some objectivity needs to be present.  There\'s no debate between Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes With all due respect to Joe Burrow, who is an elite quarterback, there is no comparison between the two. The accolades, numbers and performances all give the edge (sometimes a major edge) to Patrick Mahomes. The only thing Burrow has over Mahomes is a 3-1 record in their matchups, but the idea that a win belongs to the quarterback alone is absurd and should be dying out.     Patrick Mahomes winning Super Bowl MVP Even beyond that, Palmer\'s take has no substance. He tried to make it a deeper argument than the numbers by saying that Joe Burrow is consistent and has no flaws. He also added that he runs the plays in the system more often. If Burrow is a flawless quarterback, then there isn\'t a word to describe Mahomes. If Burrow is consistent, then so is Patrick Mahomes and he\'s consistently great. Burrow has gotten better each season in the league, but that doesn\'t make him consistently better than Mahomes, who started out winning MVP.        Furthermore, ""he\'s more accountable to run the system and the play that\'s called"" is just a poor take. The best quarterbacks are able to adjust, audible and make plays out of rhythm and out of design. Is Palmer saying Burrow doesn\'t do that? Yes, Mahomes does audible and make plays that weren\'t called. That\'s the mark of a good quarterback. The play call isn\'t the be all end all, which is the very reason audibles exist in the first place.     In Palmer\'s mind, Joe Burrow is going to get the play call in the huddle and go to the line and run it well. Mahomes, on the other hand, might do something else. Over his five seasons as a starter, he\'s earned the right to do that and has displayed the skill and IQ to do it well.    Palmer mentions that Burrow throws it far enough and is fast enough. He doesn\'t throw it as far as Patrick Mahomes, though. He\'s also a touch slower than Mahomes, who ran the 40 0.1 seconds faster and has a proven scrambling ability.Palmer\'s hot take is just that - hot. It appears to use substance and provide alternative ways of looking at the debate, but even those don\'t really hold water. By Palmer\'s own metrics, Patrick Mahomes is still a better quarterback. That\'s nothing against Burrow, though.     ', ""Is Caleb Williams the greatest USC QB ever? Comparing the Heisman winner to Matt Leinart, Carson Palmer, and past Trojans  Caleb Williams was wildly impressive last season.

Williams was so good he has ascended to becoming one of the top five USC QBs of all time, but with only one season under his belt, he can't top the list just yet.

Unfortunately for him, his career was never highlighted with a national title run or a Heisman Trophy award, so his name tends to get lost in the shuffle.  #4) Pat Haden (1973-74)  Many college football fans know Pat Haden as the athletic director for the Trojans, where he led many programs to great heights. What they may not know about Pat Haden, is that he was one of the greatest QBs in the history of USC.      Haden played so well in his three Rose Bowl appearances he was named to the Rose Bowl Hall-of-Fame. Haden was a highly prolific QB in an era where the offense was hard to come by.  #3) Carson Palmer (2000-02)  Carson Palmer was the epitome of a prototypical QB who seemingly did everything well. Pete Carroll arrived before Palmer's junior season, and fans saw the best version of him during his last two seasons of eligibility.  Palmer was one of the most productive QBs in the modern era, throwing for 72 TDs and almost 12,000 yards. Palmer played his best ball during his final season as he was awarded the Heisman Trophy.  #2) Caleb Williams (2022-present)  The only thing that stands in Caleb Williams' way is whether he puts together another campaign as he did in 2022. Williams was otherworldly and dominated every team put in his way last season. As a sophomore, he took home the 2022 Heisman Trophy.      Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic - Tulane v USC Several Trojan QBs have taken home the Heisman Trophy, but no one has been able to win two recognitions. With head coach Lincoln Riley dialing up the plays and plenty of weapons around him, Williams should be in the running for the Heisman Trophy once again.  #1) Matt Leinart (2003-05)  As great as Caleb Williams played last year, many have forgotten how good Matt Leinart was. Leinart was so good at USC that there's an argument that he is the greatest Trojan football player ever. Leinart only lost twice during his tenure in Southern Cal. Leinart was awarded every collegiate sports award imaginable. The USC team during the Leinart era was a collection of some of the best athletes the Trojans had ever seen.      "", ""5 NFL QBs who demanded to be traded by their team ft. Brett Favre\xa0  It's extremely rare for great NFL quarterbacks to spend their entire careers with just one team. This is especially true with the modern format of free agency. Most quarterbacks want to test the free agent market at least once during their careers to maximize the value of their contracts. This has contributed to most quarterbacks changing teams at some point in their careers.  Trades are another way that quarterbacks may experience a team swap. Their current team may trade them if they are dissatisfied with their performances or are looking to acquire capital during a rebuilding phase, among other situations.         Other times, quarterbacks may demand a trade themselves because they are unhappy with their place in their current organization.            Here are five such examples. #1 - Deshaun Watson Cleveland Browns QB Deshaun Watson Deshaun Watson demanded a trade from the Houston Texans during the 2020 offseason after becoming unhappy with the long-term contract negotiations. He ended up sitting out for the entire 2021 NFL season while also dealing with a legal situation off the field.  He was eventually traded to the Cleveland Browns before the start of the 2022 NFL season. He signed a massive contract extension worth $230 million in guaranteed money before serving an 11-game suspension.         #2 - Carson Palmer Oakland Raiders QB Carson Palmer     Carson Palmer began his career with the Cincinnati Bengals. He reportedly became unhappy with the franchise's efforts to build a competitive team around him and demanded to be traded during the 2011 NFL offseason.  The Bengals initially refused, and Palmer threatened to retire, claiming he would never play for them again. The Bengals eventually gave in and traded him to the Oakland Raiders. #3 - Baker Mayfield Carolina Panthers QB Baker Mayfield Baker Mayfield spent the first four years of his NFL career with the Cleveland Browns. His performances were inconsistent, but he sought a long-term contract to become their franchise quarterback. The Browns went a different direction, acquiring Deshaun Watson instead.      Mayfield was frustrated with the Browns' decision and demanded a trade. They granted his wish, shipping him to the Carolina Panthers. #4 - Brett Favre New York Jets QB Brett Favre Brett Favre had one of the most notorious exits in NFL history when he departed from the Green Bay Packers. He announced his retirement during the 2008 NFL offseason, and the Packers proceeded to name Aaron Rodgers their starting quarterback.  Favre changed his mind a few weeks later, but the Packers decided they would stick with Rodgers as their starter.         Favre became angry with the franchise for not giving him his job back and demanded to be traded. He attempted to force his way onto the Minnesota Vikings, but the Packers traded him to the New York Jets instead. He ended up joining the Vikings two years later during free agency. #5 - Matt Ryan Indianapolis Colts QB Matt Ryan     Matt Ryan spent his entire career with the Atlanta Falcons before the 2022 NFL season. He established himself as one of the best quarterbacks in franchise history. The Falcons reportedly made an aggressive effort to acquire Deshaun Watson during the 2022 off-season. Ryan was frustrated with their attempt to replace him and demanded a trade. They granted his wish, sending him to the Indianapolis Colts shortly after. Unsure about a trade offer?

Now, with two weeks left in the season, the winner is definitely not decided, but there are only a few candidates who have a realistic shot at winning the trophy. There will no doubt be shuffling of the order for the award over these last two weeks, especially if someone has a huge closing kick, and with multiple players vying for this award, it will be interesting to watch how the race shakes out.The MVP, by nature of the game nowadays, is most assuredly a quarterback award because they have the ball in their hands every game and affect the game more than anyone else. With that said, there have been other performances by non-quarterbacks that are worthy of MVP consideration, including Antonio Brown, who combined with Ben Roethlisberger, have combined to lead one of the best offenses in the league, Luke Kuechley, who, if not for three missed games would have a credible case of being on the list as the nominal defender on the list, and Adrian Peterson, who has carried a subpar Vikings offense to a 9-5 record. You could also mention JJ Wattt with these names, but none quite had the impact of the five that make this list.   #5 Russell Wilson                  Russell Wilson has rode a ridiculous five game stretch into the MVP discussion. If we had looked at this list after nine games, Russell Wilson would have been no where to be found. At that time he was piloting a struggling Seahawks offense and had 10 touchdowns to go with seven interecptions, but then some sort of switch flicked on Wilson has led the Seahawks on an offensive tear that has seen them score no fewer than 29 points in a game. Even more impressive has been Wilson’s own personal stats where he is averaging 284 yards per game with 9.6 yards per attempt and 19 touchdowns to zero interceptions. He’s also chipped in nearly 30 yards rushing per game.     Wilson’s rise in game has been one of the biggest storylines over the last month and has put him rightfully in the MVP conversation. However, he is a tier below the other quarterbacks because he was so pedestrian through the first nine weeks of the season which will make it nearly impossible for him to rise much higher in the voting. But if Wilson can keep up his very impressive play, he might be taking home a more important trophy come February #4 Josh Norman Josh Norman has been shutting down everyone that crosses his path this season.     DeAndre Hopkins 5 catchtes (11 targets) – 53 yards 0 tds. Dez Bryant 2 (8) – 26 yards 0 tds. Julio Jones 7 (10) – 88 yards 0 tds. Odell Beckham Jr. 6 (9) – 76 yards 1 td. Thats four of the top 10 receivers in the league held to a collective average stat line of 5 catches (9.5 targets) – 60.75 yards and .25 tds when they have been primarily covered by Norman this season. Compare that to their average stat line of 6.3 catches (11 targets) – 87.1 yards and .6 tds and you have a corner who has helped neuter receiving options in a game geared towards making catching the ball as easy as possible. Now just looking at catch, target, and yards in a game for a receiver can be noisy, we don’t always have the necessary coverage information to assign blame, the defender doesn’t usually follow the receiver every where and their can be cases where the receivers beats the defender but drops the ball, but watch the games and Norman has an enormous impact.     He is the leading pass defender on the number two pass defense in the league and you can consistently find him making plays, as evidende by his 4 interceptions, 2 return touchdowns, and 16 passes defensed. Some people would reserve this defensive spot for JJ Watt, but as dominant as he can be, I can’t say he has been more valuable than Norman this year. #3 Tom Brady Tom Brady is having another stellar season. What is there to say about Tom Brady at this point? He just keep chugging along playing just as good as any quarterback in the league, beating the NFL’s weak DeflateGate suspension and NFL defenses on a week to week basis. Even as Brady has seen weapon after weapon drop around him [Dion Lewis (season), Julian Edelman (5 games), Rob Gronkowski (2 games), LeGarrette Blount (season)], he has continually made the plays that have the Patriots sitting at 11-2 and atop the AFC.     He is leading the league with 35 touchdown passes and 4,405 yards despite sometimes never having an above average pass catcher on the field. He also has a rush offense that hasn’t produced consistently all year, allowing teams to load up on the pass, yet all of it hasn’t mattered. Even with a dimished ability to throw the ball downfield with great accuracy, Brady has been dominant by morphing into the best short game passer in the league, able to hit his pleothra of underneath targets time after time. He consistently picks up chunks of yardage and has the Patriots poised for another deep run into the playoffs. #2 Cam Newton Cam Newton has been passing, scrambling, scoring, and dancing his way to an MVP caliber season.     Superman has truly been super this year, putting up over 3,900 yards of total offense (passing and rushing combined) and 40 touchdowns, more than making up for the lack of pure passing stats that he has. Due to his team’s lack of weapons in the passing game and the strength of their run game, Cam has facilitated between the dreaded “game manager” to out right stud, but every step of the way, he has made play after play for the Panthers. Even though he doesn’t throw as much as you would expect from a typical MVP quarterback, he makes each throw count with a td every 13 pass attempts. Cam has buoyed his passing with the ever present threat of his running, putting up over 500 yards and seven touchdowns and giving the Panthers a goal line threat unlike any other in the league. Cam is a quarterback whose stat line doesn’t pop like a traditional quarterback’s, but when you watch the game, you just can’t take your eyes off of him and the impact he is having game after game. He is constantly making plays and if he ends the season like he has played the last few weeks, he very well could be the MVP.     #1 Carson Palmer Carson Palmer responded to a torn ACL last year to have a career year. Carson Palmer, a player many thought was done when he decided to retire in 2010 than play for the Cincinnati Bengals, is now my front runner for the MVP award this season. He currently leads the 11-2 Arizona Cardinals and their number one passing offense, as they have assaulted the league with Bruce Arians downfield passing attack. He currently leads the league in yards per attempt, is third in the league in passing yards and touchdown passes, and is second in quarterback rating.     He is also the top-rated quarterback by Football Outsiders advanced rankings and ESPN’s QBR. But what Palmer has done is even more than all the stats that back up his candidacy, he directs coach Arians high risk, high reward offense with beautiful aplomb. The Cardinals vertical passing game could bury a lesser quarterback and lead to many turnovers and missed opportunities, but not Palmer. He has been deathly accurate which is a must for any vertical passing attack to be successful, and has played with the reckless abandon that makes this passing attack unlike any other in the league. For this reason, I have Palmer as my narrow choice over Cam Newton.

While a few teams are set with the best of the best in Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, and Russell Wilson, others have a promising future with Carson Wentz, Watson, and Jared Goff.  However, there are a few that have the full package apart from the signal caller spot. This year has some big-name quarterbacks hitting the open market such as AJ McCarron, Kirk Cousins, Sam Bradford, and Case Keenum.        Adding to that some great talent in this year's draft and most of these teams will be searching for options ahead of the upcoming season. Here are five teams who need to sort out their quarterback situation: #5 Buffalo Bills The Bills have two quarterbacks under contract for next season, Tyrod Taylor and Nathan Peterman. Taylor is most likely on his way out with Buffalo looking to lower the money he is making, or trade him. Nathan could develop, but he was awful when he got his opportunity this past season. Taylor's situation has been strange in Buffalo for a while. He has always played well for them, but it seems as if they never really wanted him to be their guy. Even if Nathan was thought to be the solution prior to his terrible performances, Buffalo couldn't possibly feel comfortable with him as of today. Buffalo have two first-round picks in this year's draft. It is possible they select a quarterback in their position or even use the picks to move up and draft one of the best available. No matter what, they are in a tight situation.     #4 Cleveland Browns Ghosts of Browns past The Browns have been the cream of the crap in the NFL for decades now. They attempted the Brock project last season and that flopped hard. Kizer was not great in his first year, but he could develop if given the proper attention and time. He is the sole reason the Browns don't place higher on this list. The Browns can't give up on Kizer after only one season, but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't beef up their quarterback room a bit.     If Cousins is chasing after the most money or a hero's treatment, Cleveland may be the spot for him. No matter who it is, they have to add some veteran leadership. They had three very young quarterbacks on the roster once Brock was cut. Kizer isn't starter-ready as of this moment and even his college head coach acknowledged that fact before the draft. The Browns need a guy who is capable of starting now and that guy isn't on the roster. #3 Denver Broncos Is Lynch a bust?     The Broncos are in quarterback purgatory. Trevor isn't the answer, Brock certainly isn't the answer, and Lynch does not seem to be either. Elway has struck out on quarterbacks and his history makes his choices in the draft untrustworthy. Denver needs to pray free agent quarterbacks are interested in going to Mile High. The defense is ageing, but it is still a top 10 in the league. That might be enough to attract Case, Kirk, Bradford, or someone else. A veteran who is average at best could help to elevate this team back to the playoffs. Denver do not have much of an open window left. They are even shopping some of their talent to make some space. Elway wants this team to raise more banners and for that to happen they need a huge quarterback overhaul. #2 New York Jets Jets need a franchise QB     The New York media can chew these guys up and spit them out. The latest examples are guys like Smith. He was never ready for his spotlight. Right now, there is no guy on the roster capable of leading this team to the promise land. The Jets need a locker room leader who can make big plays for them. They can definitely find a guy who fits the bill in this year's draft. No matter how they get it done the Jets need to start the search for a franchise quarterback. They certainly don't have one on their roster. Hopefully, whoever it is doesn't get booed by his own fans immediately. #1 Arizona Cardinals Palmer retires... Now what?     Do the Cardinals even have a mediocre quarterback on the roster? Carson Palmer is officially retired and that leaves Arizona in a bad place. There was no one on the roster who could step up as a true number one quarterback. Last year, Arizona made a huge mistake not drafting a quarterback. They need to draft one this year. They do not have the best spot in the draft either. That will make it even more difficult to find a replacement for Palmer. No team in the NFL has as little talent on the roster at the position or options in the off-season. Which is why they are in the worst quarterback situation in the NFL.

However, it is no secret that Murray is still looking for some zeroes to be added to his paycheck. Of course, the Cardinals have been hesitant to do just that so far. However, one NFL analyst has called for the team to stop the hesitation.         Speaking on The Herd with Colin Cowherd, show host Colin Cowherd lauded Kyler Murray\'s skills. He also pointed out the one-way street in which the Cardinals currently find themselves. Here\'s how Cowherd put it:           ""[Murray\'s] good. It\'s established. He saved the franchise. It\'s established. He\'s gotten better every year. It\'s established. I think of Kingsbury. [He\'s] got a little pressure, higher pressure than [Murray] because college and pro Kliff Kingsbury\'s teams get worse late every year of his career.""

I understand it. Time for him to take it next level.     He continued to back the quarterback over the coach: ""And I think some of that [is] Kliff and not Kyler. So I don\'t sense a lot of pressure there. I think the pressure with him is they\'re going to pay him and he wants to perform. But I have no doubt, I would pay him tomorrow."" Cowherd went on to explain that the Cardinals don\'t have any other options aside from Murray: ""If I was the Cardinals -- I said this about Lamar [Jackson] -- you don\'t pay Lamar and Kyler, who you starting next year? I don\'t want to hear about their passer rating and their injuries. That was a playoff team. The [performance] in his playoff game wasn\'t very good, but I think we know why.""

Lastly, he pointed out one downside to Kyler Murray but also gave a possible solution in the same breath: ""He\'s like, \'I\'m not gonna run much. I\'m not gonna get hurt,\' which I didn\'t love but I get I think that\'s solvable. Pay him and he\'ll put his body in more harm\'s way.”  How has Kyler Murray\'s NFL career progressed so far?     Arizona Cardinals v Los Angeles Rams Kyler Murray has proven to be a somewhat divisive figure in the NFL community. Some have doubts about his size and long-term fit in the league, while others see a continually improving quarterback and want to go all-in.  Either way, Murray\'s fourth season could be his most important one yet.         His career began in 2019, when he was drafted in the first round of the 2019 NFL Draft by the Arizona Cardinals. In his rookie year, the quarterback went 5-10-1, according to Pro Football Reference. Murray\'s statline was much better than his winning percentage, throwing for 20 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.     In 2020, Kyler Murray went 8-8, throwing for 26 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. However, the 2021 season proved to be his best one since he joined the league. He went 9-5 and helped his team get into the playoffs for the first time since Carson Palmer was on the team.      It was a brief appearance, but one the quarterback was hoping would prove himself fit to be around for a long time.Now without a long-term deal, Kyler Murray is facing down the prospect of needing to prove something greater in 2022. Will Murray wow the team or validate the franchise\'s fears?

To be the most valuable player in the whole league is a huge accomplishment. The award has historically been dominated by the Quarterbacks, including 10 of the last 11 seasons. The only player in that time span to win the award, who didn’t play at QB, was Adrian Peterson, after an incredible 2012 season. Over the past 5 seasons, 5 different QBs have won the prestigious award. Those QBs are Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Cam Newton, Matt Ryan and Tom Brady. Here I take a look at the players who are in the running to win this seasons MVP, at this early stage.  5. David Johnson        Too many people are sleeping on David Johnson in 2018. DJ lost the whole 2017 season to a broken wrist in week 1. His loss was a brutal blow to the Cardinals offense and team as a whole. It was a freak injury that is unlikely to reoccur. So, let’s just wipe 2017 from our minds and take a look at his previous season in the league.            In 2016, Johnson recorded 1239 rushing yards and 16 TDs, as well as catching 80 passes for 879 yards and a further 4 TDs. That is a huge return for any player, and even outshines the performances of Todd Gurley and Leveon Bell last season. Gurley was in the MVP talk last year, so if DJ was to replicate his 2016 form, then there is no reason as to why he can’t be in the same conversation.  The Cardinals offense is going to be different this year round though because Carson Palmer has retired, and either Sam Bradford or Josh Rosen will be starting under center. Both QBs are going to lean on Johnson and he is going to get a lot of volume.      His goal is to get over 1000 rushing yards, as well as 1000 receiving yards. If he achieves that feat, then he could well be in the running for MVP. #4 Drew Brees Dallas Cowboys v New Orleans Saints Brees had a very successful season last year for the Saints. The team changed the offensive emphasis by utilizing a run-first approach. Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram both had fantastic seasons, and this relieved some of the pressure on the 39-year-old Brees. He had 536 attempts, which is his lowest in a 16 game season since he joined the Saints in 2006.      It was also his lowest YPG (Yards Per Game) total over the same time period. He did complete 72% of his passes, which marked a career high. I can see opposing teams focusing more on stopping the run, which should open up the passing game even more for the highly talented Brees. I think Brees will improve on his 23TDs thrown in 2017.  The Saints have assembled a talented young squad which could go all of the way in 2018. They now have a solid defense, to go with their talented offense. Brees could lead the Saints on charge, all the way to the Super Bowl. #3 Carson Wentz Cleveland Browns v Philadelphia Eagles     Carson Wentz was putting together a stunning 2017 season, until a torn ACL ended his season early. Wentz was firmly in the running for league MVP until that week 14 injury against the Rams. He threw for 3296 yards, with an incredible 33 TDs and 7 INTs. If he can replicate that sort of form, then he will easily be in with a chance of earning MVP honours.  The Eagles, fresh off of the back of their Super Bowl win, have a great all round team, with no real weaknesses. There has been talk of Wentz having to adapt his elusive style of play, to more of that of a pocket passer. That is a rumour that Wentz has been quick to dismiss, whilst stepping up his rehab from injury.  The Philadelphia faithful are hopeful to have their star QB available for their week one matchup against the Falcons. There is likely to be some regression from Wentz this season as his TD rate was phenomenal in 2017. That being said, if he can get healthy and play 15/16 games, then I expect the Eagles to go deep in to the playoffs again.     #2 Tom Brady Pittsburgh Steelers v New England Patriots You can’t compile a list of potential MVP candidates without mentioning TB12. Brady has won the MVP award 3 times in his career, as well as 5 Super Bowls and 13 Pro Bowl honors. No matter how many people are hoping the Patriots fail and are calling for their demise, my money is on the Patriots being there or there about when the Super Bowl comes around. Brady won the MVP award in 2017, after another incredible season. He led the league with 4577 passing yards despite having his favorite WR, Julian Edelman, out for the season. He threw for 32 TDs and just 8 INTS, with a QB rating of 102.8. Despite now being 40 years of age, Brady is showing no signs of slowing up. He led the Patriots to another Super Bowl appearance in 2017 and was only denied another ring by an inspired Eagles team.      The Patriots are by far and away the favorite to win the AFC East for a record 10th time in a row. The Bills, Dolphins and Jets are little threat for Brady and the Pats, and you’d fully expect them to win their 6 divisional match ups. I expect the Patriots to win 12 games again this season, with Tom Brady leading the way. #1 Aaron Rodgers Wild Card Round - Green Bay Packers v Washington Redskins Aaron Rodgers is the clear favorite with the bookies at the moment, to win the 2018 MVP award. Rodgers is looking to make a comeback after his 2017 season was ended by a broken collarbone, at the hands of arch-rivals, the Minnesota Vikings. Rodgers is one of the best QBs to have ever played the game, and when he is playing, the Packers have a chance to make the SuperBowl.      With Rodgers on the sideline last season, the Packers showed they are a much weaker team. Rodgers has a high powered offense at his disposal, despite the loss of Jordy Nelson this offseason. He has Davante Adams and Randall Cobb, as well as a new acquisition at Tight End in Jimmy Graham. The Packers also have 3 good Running Backs to help ease the pressure on Rodgers. Rodgers is usually a lock for 35-40 TDs a season, as well as throwing just 5-8 interceptions. He is also usually good for at least 530 passing attempts and over 4000 yards. His ability to make accurate passes on the run as well as in the pocket, make him the hardest QB to play against in the league. If Rodgers can lead the Packers to an 11+ win season, then it is highly likely that he walks away with the MVP award for the 3rd time in his career.

13,Matt Barkley,"['Jets close out preseason against eagles, tracking NFL cuts  The New York Jets travel across the turnpike tonight to take on the Philadelphia Eagles.   The fourth and final game of the 2014 preseason takes place tonight for all 32 teams in the league. The Jets and Eagles will kickoff at 7:00pm ET. The affair will be televised on CBS2 in the New York area; ABC6 for fans closer to Philly. As always, ESPN NY 98.7 will carry the radio broadcast. For streaming purposes, fans can take advantage of NFL.com’s Preseason Live at a discounted rate of $14.99.        What’s left to learn?           Will the Jets carry more than three running backs? The top trio of backs should be shoe-ins to make the 53-man roster — Chris Ivory, Chris Johnson, and Bilal Powell — but there’s a pair of backs that could sneak in. Daryl Richardson was brought in via a waiver claim (from St. Louis), and has looked solid in playing time. Alex Green has been with the Jets since last season and has also performed well in the offseason, after initially thinking Richardson’s claim to be his pink slip. What’s most interesting here is the way the depth chart is set-up before tonight’s game. (Screen Caps: NYJets.com)  Notice here that Ivory, Johnson, and Powell are all listed as first-stringers and Green/Richardson are listed as ‘Others.’ Is this an appreciation of the top backs’ production, an ominous message for the bottom two backs, or both?     If the Jets planned to enter the season with just two quarterbacks, Matt Simms has probably changed those plans. Simms has showed consistent improvement since first joining the squad in 2012, and has had QB Coach David Lee raving about his offseason performance. On the flip side, draftee Tajh Boyd has looked over-matched in the bright lights and will hope to use tonight’s opportunity (if available) to stake claim of one of the practice squad spots — which is bolstered from eight to ten, starting this year. This could be the last time we see WR Stephen Hill, who the Jets reportedly tried to trade this offseason. Without any bidders or signs of improvement from the former second-rounder, Hill could be given his walking papers very soon. On defense, all eyes will be on the cornerback position, given its absence of depth due to injury and lack of experience, and Dimitri Patterson’s surprise absence versus the Giants. Fourth-year player Ellis Lankster has a chance to thrust himself into a starting role with a strong showing against Matt Barkley and the Eagles offense. (Note: Mark Sanchez will not play tonight.)     Linebacker is a position with a stronger, but still intriguing battle. Incumbents David Harris, Demario Davis, Calvin Pace, and Quinton Coples aren’t going anywhere, but the backups behind them could have a different look this season.  Veteran Jason Babin has looked very strong in his time in green, and will possibly be used beyond the ‘situation pass-rusher’ role that perhaps the Jets first imagined. A.J. Edds has been one of the better tacklers of the preseason. Nick Bellore is outplaying his special-teams-only role of old. Even Garrett McIntyre is finding his way into opposing teams’ backfields. There is a lot to like about the linebacking competition right now. Monitoring the Cuts The Jets will attempt to skim (just) the fat off their roster, but other teams’ cuts may provide opportunity for Gang Green, who very well could be active with waiver claims. Former Bills wide receiver, Stevie Johnson, is going to have a tough go to stick with a crowded receiver group in San Francisco. Reports are that Johnson and QB Colin Kaepernick are still not ‘clicking,‘ in terms of timing. With Johnson now being projected as a fourth wide receiver, he could soon be on the waiver wire. The New York Jets would have to be interested an upgraded complement to Decker, but they’d have to put up with Johnson’s unique behavior to benefit.     Cornerback Mike Harris was recently released by the Jaguars and I believe he’d be a good player to bring into the building and develop.We’ll update you on all the biggest cuts and specifically those that could be a good fit for the Jets, as they come in later today and beyond.     ', ""Best Quarterback Rooms in NFL - 2018 Edition  The quarterback position is arguably the most important position in the NFL, while the backup quarterback position is the second most important position. The spot has not been in a better situation than 2018 in a long time. The quarterback climate has a perfect mix of veterans and new blood.  The ranking for the quarterback room has taken into account the starter, backup quarterback, scout team QB, supporting cast, offensive system and teams' expected run-to-pass ratio along with past performance and history of injury.        The article ranks the teams by scoring each quarterback and taking the cumulative score as a marker. The third quarterback is only taken into account if they are a viable trade bait or hold any chance to start during the regular season.           #32 Jacksonville Jaguars Starter - Blake Bortles, Backup - Cody Kessler Blake Bortles will try to not let his defense down It is one of the very few quarterback-proof rosters in the NFL. The team will look to lean on the run game in the offense this season. Blake Bortles has to improve his mechanics to move out the bottom of the list and Kessler will need to shake off his winless season with the Browns.     #31 Carolina Panthers Starter - Cam Newton, Backup - Taylor Heinicke Newton will have to become the Superman from 2015 Cam has to be the Superman again under new ownership. Panthers have Taylor Heinicke as their backup. If you are thinking who that person is, you are not alone. #30 Kansas City Chiefs Starter - Pat Mahomes, Backup - Chad Henne Mahomes will have to be the present and future of the squad     Pat Mahomes has not started a relevant game in the NFL. He has potential but Texas Tech's air raid offense is not the best to go by. Chad Henne couldn't beat out Blake Bortles at his worst, which is not the best news for Chiefs faithful. #29 Miami Dolphins Starter - Ryan Tannehill, Backup - Brock Osweiler Tannehill will be playing for his job Brock Osweiler can't be described as the best backup policy for Tannehill, who is coming back from a knee injury last season. The coaching staff is in the hot seat and sharing the division with Patriots does not help.     #28 Washington Redskins Starter - Alex Smith, Backup - Colt McCoy Alex Smith will have to bring his MVP season from Kansas City Alex Smith might live up to his MVPesque season from last time but McCoy would live on as a below average backup QB forever. Alex Smith ain't the worst option after Kirk Cousins left. #27 Houston Texans Starter - Deshaun Watson. Backup - Brandon Weeden Deshaun Watson will have to be the player he was before the injury     Houston has Weeden as their backup to their sophomore superstar coming off an ACL injury, O'Brien would hope for a better option than that. The team hopes to stay fit next season and do some damage in AFC. #26 Dallas Cowboys Starter - Dak Prescott, Backup - Mike White, Cooper Rush Prescott will get his sidekick in Ezekial Elliott back for the season Dak and Zeke form a formidable offense but the Cowboys quarterback room could do better than Mike White and Rush. Jason Garrett must be hoping for Kellen Moore (probably not).     #25 Cincinnati Bengals Starter - Andy Dalton, Backup - Matt Barkley Dalton will have to bemoreconsistent upcoming season Cincinnati Bengals have changes looming in front of them, the coaching staff is in the hot seat and the QB room ain't helping. Andy Dalton has been used to define the term 'average' all over the NFL dictionary and Barkley never lived up to his high school potential. #24 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Starter - Winston, Backup - Ryan Fitzpatrick Tampa Bay will not have Winston for the first 3 weeks per suspension     Winston will serve his ban and Ryan Fitzpatrick will be QB-1 in the depth chart, sounds depressing, probably is. #23 Baltimore Ravens Starter/ Backup - Joe Flacco, Lamar Jackson. The QB competition is in full swing at Ravens camp Ravens' coaching has been immensely impressed with rookie Lamar Jackson. The reports from preseason indicate that Joe Flacco has been showing more initiation as well. Ravens will be looking to capitalize on a soft AFC. #22 Chicago Bears Starter - Mitchell Trubisky, Backup - Chase Daniels Trubisky can lead Bears to playoffs and become the greatest franchise QB     Bears have a new offensive system and Chase Daniel as the backup, who has come from the Chiefs system that Matt Nagy will be running. Trubisky needs to live up to his draft pedigree and Bears can easily jump to the next tier. #21 Buffalo Bills Starter - AJ McCarron, Backup - Josh Allen, Nathan Peterman The team will hope for Josh Allen to win the starting job Bills brought in McCarron from Bengals as an insurance policy to their Rookie, Josh Allen. Bills have an average starter, one raw rookie, and a backup with starting capabilities in Peterman. No one should be surprised if everyone gets a start in Buffalo.     #20 Denver Broncos Starter - Case Keenum, Backup - Paxton Lynch, Chad Kelly Keenum will hop to fill the big shoes of Peyton Manning Case Keenum had a career year last season but he won't have the similar support cast as Minnesota. Paxton Lynch has bust written all over him and won't even command a conditional pick in return. #19 Tennessee Titans Starter - Marcus Mariota, Backup - Blaine Gabbert Mariota needs to bounce back from a dreadful last season     Titans have been a run first team but Mariota needs to improve his play for them to compete against Houston in the division. Gabbert can be a great backup in the correct system with his cannon arm and great mobility. #18 New York Giants Starter - Eli Manning, Backup - Davis Webb/ Kyle Lauletta Eli Manning will have to deliver with the run game to support Eli Manning has lost way too many steps to be a top tier QB but his stellar offensive sidekicks should take him to the belief land. Davis Webb has been making a lot of noise this offseason along with Kyle Lauletta at the backup position.     #17 Oakland Raiders Starter - Derek Carr, Backup - Connor Cooks Derek Carr will have to gel into Gruden's offense sooner than later Derek Carr underachieved last season. Cook and Carr will soon realize that life under Gruden is not as rosy as Gruden Camp. The team has Jeff Fisher vibes of finishing 8-8. #16 Detroit Lions Starter - Matthew Stafford, Backup - Matt Cassel Stafford can rise up to the next level     Stafford has one of the best arm seen in the sport but he needs a better support cast. How does Matt Cassel still have a job in NFL, even though it is as a backup? #15 Atlanta Falcons Starter - Matt Ryan, Backup - Matt Schaub Matt Ryan can bring the Falcons to the top Matt Ryan has had a legendary career till now, without winning the big one. The bad news is that they have Matt Schaub as the backup. #14 New Orleans Saints Starter - Drew Brees, Backup - Tom Savage     Drew Brees will look to take Saints further than last time Saints are moving on to a more run-heavy offense which might help the longevity of Brees. Saints are one of the big boys of NFC and Brees would love to make one last run before father time gets him. Tom Savage is not what you dream of as a backup but Saints don't have an option. Hill is the scout team QB who is turning heads at camp. #13 Seattle Seahawks Starter - Russell Wilson, Backup - Austin Davis     Russell Wilson will look for some help from the run offense Russell Wilson is a one-man offense for Seahawks with zero run game, no O-line help and below par receiving core. Russell Wilson does it all but sadly Austin Davis can't. The diminishing quality of Seahawks defense makes their chances of playoff dim. #12 Los Angeles Rams LA Rams - Starter - Jared Goff, Backup - Sean Mannion Goff will look to improve on his stellar performance last season     Jared Goff took a big leap last season. Sean McVay has been a godsend to Rams offense. Sean Mannion is not the best backup option but he has been in the system and a good subordinate to the young future of Los Angeles. Goff is a sneaky MVP candidate with Gurley by the sides. #11 Pittsburgh Steelers Starter - Roethlisberger, Backup - Mason Rudolph/ Landry Jones Roethlisberger will look to capitalize on Bell's last year in Pittsburgh Steelers have a complete offense led by Big Ben. His two quarterback understudies are raw and with minimal arm talent. Roethlisberger has been injured in bits and pieces over the last few seasons and the weak backup situation doesn't help the Steelers.     #10 Los Angeles Chargers Starter - Rivers, Backup - Geno Smith/ Cardale Jones Rivers will be looking for some luck and support from the fans Rivers is a great starter with a competent backup in Geno Smith. The run game led by Melvin Gordon with the receiving talent of Keenan Allen would be a handful for any defense. If the team stays fit, they can be a challenger for the AFC title. #09 San Francisco 49ers Starter - Jimmy Garoppolo, Backup - CJ Bethard Jimmy G will look to become Jimmy GQ     Garoppolo ended the 49ers season last year with 5 wins. The only way for the 49ers is up. Kyle Shanahan has one of the most sophisticated offenses in the league. CJ Bethard as the backup is a little suspect. Bay area is waiting for Jimmy G to become Jimmy Jesus. #8 Cleveland Browns Starter - Tyrod Taylor, Backup - Baker Mayfield/ Drew Stanton Baker and Tyrod will look to bring back the glory at Cleveland Browns were the worst team in Football but they have added to every position on the pitch. Taylor is a dependable QB, who can give you 5 wins on his worst day. Baker is the future with great football ethics and Drew Stanton will be a great third QB while developing a rookie. Browns look like a sneaky break out team for the upcoming season.     #07 Green Bay Packers Starter - Aaron Rodgers, Backup - DeShone Kizer Rodgers will be without his favorite wide receiver next season Rodgers has been known to hide most of the blemishes of his team. Packers traded for Kizer to be the backup, who was the QB of a 16 loss team. The addition of Jimmy Graham at tight end position will come as a great help after Nelson left. #06 New England Patriots Starter - Tom Brady, Backup - Brian Hoyer/ Danny Etling Brady will look to defy father time for one more season     Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time. Brian Hoyer is definitely not the greatest backup quarterback of all time. Brady's age is a sign of trouble but he is the reigning MVP of the league. Patriots have drafted Danny Etling in the late rounds who could turn up to be a great option for the future. #05 Indianapolis Colts Starter - Andrew Luck, Backup - Jacoby Brissett Luck finally looks set to be back alongside promising backup in Brissett If Andrew Luck wasn't coming back from injury, Colts could have been the top team in this exercise. Brissett has been a great trade by Colts. Luck has started training again and the revamped offensive line won't hurt either. The future looks bright for the franchise.     #04 New York Jets Starter/ Backup - Darnold, Josh McCown, Bridgewater Jets will have one of the most balanced quarterback room No one expected Jets to end up this high on the list but they have a great experienced starter and teacher in Josh McCown. They arguably got the best quarterback from the recent draft in Sam Darnold and they signed Teddy Bridgewater for free in the offseason. Bridgewater is the biggest trade asset in the league and front-runner for the comeback player of the year. Jets have stability at the position for the first time in a long time.     #03 Minnesota Vikings Starter - Kirk Cousins, Backup - Trevor Siemian Cousins will be expected to live up to his price tag The future looks bright for the franchise. Kirk Cousins is underrated even after being the costliest player in football and Siemian is as good a backup as any. Vikings will try to make the run in a loaded NFC. #02 Arizona Cardinals Starter - Sam Bradford, Backup - Josh Rosen/ Mike Glennon Rosen will look to earn the starts while Bradford needs to stay fit     The Cardinals have one of the most polished QB coming out of College in Rosen. Sam Bradford can be a top 15 quarterback when fit. The quarterback room compliments each other, unlike any other team. Cardinals can shock a lot of people next season. #01 Philadelphia Eagles Starter - Carson Wentz, Backup - Nick Foles Eagles would love another Philly special, with Wentz this time Nick Foles just won Philly the Superbowl, while the future MVP of the league (Wentz) was sidelined with an injury. Eagles have things sorted till Foles gets traded for too many draft picks. The Eagles QB room might just help them reach the mountaintop again. The in-depth look into every quarterback room made me realize that Matt Cassel, Matt Schaub, and Landry Jones will keep having backup jobs in 2096 and no one will ever notice. In conclusion. my biggest fear is that Blake Bortles will end up winning the Superbowl and make this article as irrelevant as his throwing motion.

14,Trevor Lawrence,"[""3 biggest talking points from Trevor Lawrence's performance against Saints in preseason game  Trevor Lawrence got his first taste of the bright lights of Monday Night Football against the New Orleans Saints.  The number one overall pick put on an excellent performance against the Saints. In the process, Jacksonville's fan base got a great glimpse of what their season could look like with Lawrence at quarterback. The former Clemson quarterback looked more confident in the offense.        If the Jaguars are telling the truth about a QB controversy between Trevor Lawrence and Gardner Minshew (and it's unclear whether they are), maybe they should have taken Zach Wilson.— ProFootballTalk (@ProFootballTalk) August 23, 2021           Here are three of the most significant talking points from Trevor Lawrence's second start in the NFL.  #1 Trevor Lawrence played mistake-free football two weeks in a row Trevor Lawrence completed six of his nine passes for 71 yards, and didn't throw a single interception against the Cleveland Browns in Week 1. He followed up his Week-1 performance with an even better showing against the Saints. Trevor Lawrence turned on the jets ⚡️️(via @NFL)pic.twitter.com/6KMd11e1ZI— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) August 24, 2021     Thus Lawrence has made a valid argument on why he deserves to be QB1 in Jacksonville. The rookie quarterback completed 14 of his 23 passes for 113 yards. His most significant stat was going back-to-back weeks without throwing an interception.  #2 Despite not turning the ball over, Trevor Lawrence is still looking for his first TD pass During his time at Clemson, Trevor Lawrence didn't have a problem throwing touchdowns. Lawrence threw for 90 touchdown passes during his three years at Clemson. The way it looks, Lawrence will head into the 2021 regular season without a single touchdown pass. The quarterback position is one of the most challenging spots to play in the NFL. So, Lawrence's slow start is expected, as he is a rookie quarterback. Unfortunately for Lawrence, he finds himself in an unfamiliar situation. The former college star quarterback finds himself in a quarterback battle with Gardner Minshew. Every snap Lawrence takes could determine whether he starts or sits Week 1 of the regular season.      #3 Trevor Lawrence hasn't locked up the starting QB job after two starts Urban Meyer has one of the most challenging decisions of his young coaching career in the NFL. The former Ohio State head coach will need to decide soon on which quarterback will start Week 1 of the regular season. As things stand, neither Trevor Lawrence nor Gardner Minshew has created separation. Minshew and Lawrence both have played average football over the last two games. Where the rookie quarterback holds a slight lead, Minshew is in the turnover category. Minshew has thrown interceptions in back-to-back weeks, while Lawrence hasn't thrown a single one.Urban Meyer can either give the fans what they want, or control his team and go against the fan base. That's a decision fans are happy they do not have to make.     "", ""Weather for Jets game tonight: Jaguars face challenging conditions ahead of Week 16 TNF showdown  The Jacksonville Jaguars will travel to MetLife Stadium to face the New York Jets on Thursday Night Football. The Jaguars may have gotten on the plane to temperatures in the high 60's, but it will be a much different story when they land in the northeast.  As winter weather brought by Storm Elliot sweeps across the United States, there are sure to be some disruptions this weekend in some important NFL games. The first being tonight's game where the temperature at kickoff is set to be in the 40's, which wouldn't be bad if that were the only weather issue. There is also an 80% chance of rain and heavy winds are also expected throughout the game.                      The Jaguars have already played in one game this season that was affected by weather, in Week 4 against the Philadelphia Eagles. The main issue for Jacksonville in that game was ball security as it is for most teams when the conditions are wet and windy. Fantasy Football Weather Guys@FFWeatherGuysWinter Storm #Elliot will start to impact the Northeast tonight, driving heavy rain and wind for tonight's #TNFonPrime event where the New York Jets host the Jacksonville Jaguars91Winter Storm #Elliot will start to impact the Northeast tonight, driving heavy rain and wind for tonight's #TNFonPrime event where the New York Jets host the Jacksonville Jaguars https://t.co/JT0piejPuj     Jaguars offensive coordinator Press Taylor told reporters on Tuesday that they are aware of the weather outlook. He said that he knows what changes they need to make to improve on their performance earlier in the year: “We understand that we kind of had our own self-inflicted issues in Philly in terms of our ball security. That’s just something we’ve been aware of, we’ve tried to emphasize that. Every single week we’ve gone in, we’ve played games where there’s expected rain. Whether that was home games or on the road. That’s certainly something we’re aware of, we understand that we have to do a better job than we did.”         Quarterback Trevor Lawrence is even pondering the idea of wearing gloves during Thursday night's game to help him grip the ball. He fumbled four times and threw one interception the last time he played in the rain. Lawrence has had a solid past few weeks, including an overtime win over the Dallas Cowboys in Week 15. Whether he will switch up the game plan will likely be a gametime decision. IS QB Zach Wilson playing in Week 16 against the Jaguars? The Jacksonville Jaguars are still alive in the AFC South race and after a win against the Dallas Cowboys last week, anything can happen for this young team. Their next obstacles will be the New York Jets and the poor weather conditions. WFAN Sports Radio@WFAN660It will officially be Zach Wilson starting for the Jets again on Thursday:bit.ly/3hM7Ejn71It will officially be Zach Wilson starting for the Jets again on Thursday:bit.ly/3hM7Ejn     So, who will be the starting quarterback for the New York Jets? That would be Zach Wilson. Although Wilson was benched by head coach Robert Saleh to give him time to work on his mechanics, he returned to the starting position last week. This was due to Mike White sustaining serious rib injuries in Week 14.Saleh is putting his confidence in Wilson again this week as the Jets try to stay in the AFC playoff bubble. A loss to Jacksonville will likely take them out of contention.     "", ""NFL Rookie of the Week: Who among Mac Jones and Trevor Lawrence deserve to win?  After many months of anticipation, fans were able to see their team's rookies for the first time in Week 1 of the 2021 NFL season.  It's unwise to expect a rookie to be a significant contributor to any team right off the gate. But some first-year players do manage to dominate on their NFL debuts.        The NFL has released the list of the best rookie performers from Week 1, with some highly-touted first-round picks among the nominees.           Nominees for Rookie of the Week 1 Trevor Lawrence, Jacksonville Jaguars It wasn't a vintage performance from Trevor Lawrence on his debut as he mixed great throws with inconsistent decisions and two interceptions without the defense pressuring him. He still finished with 332 passing yards and three touchdowns, but the loss to a weak Houston Texans team will sting for a while. Apart from Lawrence, there's not much talent on the Jaguars' roster, and there will not be many more opportunities to win a game this season. Mac Jones, New England Patriots Mac Jones completed 29 passes from 39 attempts and had fewer yards and passing touchdowns than Lawrence, but he was up against a Miami Dolphins defense that's one of the best in the league. Jones, to his credit, committed no turnovers.     The Patriots missed out on a chance to win an important game, but Jones was impressive in his first start and proved that he was, in fact, a better option than Cam Newton. Minnesota Vikings v Cincinnati Bengals Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals Ja'Marr Chase silenced a lot of critics with an excellent performance on his debut for the Cincinnati Bengals. He amassed 101 yards on five catches and caught a touchdown pass against the Vikings. Chase's production should increase even more as he gets more comfortable against more robust defenses in the league.     DeVonta Smith, Philadelphia Eagles Smith's first touchdown reception in the NFL came during his first drive in the league. His connection with former Alabama teammate Jalen Hurts looked as sharp as it did in college. His route running was terrific and there were no drops during his first rookie start.

You’re not crying, I am https://t.co/JgXs75z8IP Smith amassed six receptions for 71 yards and a touchdown. Although his numbers weren't as impressive as Chase's, his impact during the game was massive. Paulson Adebo, New Orleans Saints     Paulson Adebo had a terrific start to his NFL career. Playing alongside Marshon Lattimore, the rookie looked great all day long, allowing just one catch and recording an interception as well. Adebo's development is vital to the Saints' chances of upsetting the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the NFC South crown. They need a solid number two cornerback and the rookie certainly looked the part. Elijah Mitchell, San Francisco 49ers Elijah Mitchell's debut caught everyone by surprise. He wasn't even supposed to play in Week 1, but fellow rookie Trey Sermon's surprise exclusion gave Mitchell the opportunity to start and he made the most of it.OurSF49ers@OurSf49ers_#49ers rookie RB Elijah Mitchell is humble after becoming the first player in Niner history to rush for 100 yards in their NFL debut 🔥💎1:01 PM · Sep 14, 202192343#49ers rookie RB Elijah Mitchell is humble after becoming the first player in Niner history to rush for 100 yards in their NFL debut 🔥💎 https://t.co/dRYPwXPXGZMitchell amassed 104 rushing yards and a touchdown.

"", ""Trevor Lawrence Injury Update, Fantasy Outlook, and Playing Status for Week 15  On Thursday, Trevor Lawrence attended practice and participated in a brief workout. In Week 15, the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Dallas Cowboys will play a non-conference contest. The Jaguars enter this contest fresh off a significant conference victory against the Tennessee Titans.  Despite having a toe issue the whole week, Trevor Lawrence played well in that encounter. Due to the same toe injury, Lawrence most certainly missed practice on Wednesday.        Juston W. Lewis@JustonLewis_#Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence isn’t currently at practice as Jacksonville prepares for the #Cowboys on Sunday. Lawrence missed multiple practices last week with a toe injury.337#Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence isn’t currently at practice as Jacksonville prepares for the #Cowboys on Sunday. Lawrence missed multiple practices last week with a toe injury. https://t.co/k8tlNY0Vpb           Lawrence has a shot at playing against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday, even though he missed practice on Wednesday and Thursday of last week and still played. In any game, he is still capable of exploding for 300 yards and three TDs. Trevor Lawrence's stats and fantasy prediction For the Jacksonville Jaguars this season, Trevor Lawrence has featured in each of their 13 outings this season. Just over 66% of his throws have been completed for 3,202 yards, 20 touchdowns, and six interceptions.

Lawrence's impressive Week 14 fantasy performance resulted from a weak Tennessee Titans defensive unit. The Cowboys are on the opposite side of the spectrum regarding quarterback matchups, as they give up the 30th-fewest points per game overall.     Lawrence is still a decent option for this week if you are in a deeper league or have an injured quarterback. This is because of his recent good form.Lawrence is currently on a roll with a minimum of 18 Fantasy points gained in five straight outings, including three games with a minimum of 24 points during that time. We continue to trust Lawrence as a QB1 in all formats, even though he doesn't have a simple opponent in the Dallas Cowboys in Week 15.     "", 'Did Trevor Lawrence lose $15 million in cryptocurrency?

On the field, he\'s preparing for the 2022-23 NFL season under new head coach Doug Pederson. Pederson led the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl win in 2018.

', 'Why Trevor Lawrence isn\'t Urban Meyer\'s first choice QB for the Jacksonville Jaguars yet?  When the Jacksonville Jaguars drafted quarterback Trevor Lawrence with the first overall pick, he seemed to be the team\'s incumbent starting quarterback.   With other options featuring the likes of former starter Gardner Minshew II and journeyman quarterback C.J. Beathard, it seemed that the Jaguars were planning on starting Lawrence in Week 1.        NFL teams don\'t usually draft a quarterback with the first overall pick and bench him unless there\'s a veteran on the team who is on the verge of retirement. But with that not being the case with the Jaguars, the team\'s new head coach, Urban Meyer, refusing to name Lawrence as the starter was a head-scratcher.           Why hasn\'t Trevor Lawrence been named the Jaguars starting QB yet? Jacksonville Jaguars passing game coordinator Brian Schottenheimer was quoted as saying last week that the team ""wasn\'t in a position"" to name a starting quarterback before training camp. He went on to say that Lawrence was learning the playbook well and progressing in the right direction. This week, head coach Urban Meyer did an interview on \'Sports Seriously\' with USA Today\'s Mackenzie Salmon. He elaborated on why he and his coaching staff haven\'t officially announced Trevor Lawrence as the starter yet. He said:     ""He\'s not ready yet, but he doesn\'t have to be ready yet,"" Meyer said. ""We got a long training camp coming up. He\'s probably advanced maybe a little quicker than we would\'ve thought, so which was a positive. One thing that we worked on — when we made a decision that Trevor was going to be our No. 1 pick, we went from the evaluation stage to the preparation stage. And that means that I want to see — I can\'t remember the exact date, but we started installing the playbook with him well before the draft. So you can see the retention, he\'s got a really good work ethic and he\'s progressed very well."" Meyer further added that he drafted Trevor Lawrence because he was extremely impressed with his performance at Clemson. He said that he also knows Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney quite well and that he knew that Lawrence\'s character and work ethic would be something he wanted for the Jaguars team as a whole.      Urban Meyer: Trevor Lawrence \'not ready yet\' https://t.co/eTXH45GS5o— NBC Sports EDGE Football (@NBCSEdgeFB) June 25, 2021 Meyer feels that as the new head coach of the Jaguars he needs to give each of the quarterbacks, Lawrence, Minshew, Beathard and Jake Luton, a fair opportunity in training camp to compete for the position. Meyer doesn\'t want to throw a rookie like Lawrence into the starting quarterback position if he isn\'t completely ready to do so. While Lawrence seems pro-ready, there will be a slight learning curve in the transition from college football to the NFL. Learning the playbook is something that Lawrence is already doing and seems to be doing quite well.     Urban Meyer on Trevor Lawrence\'s development: ""He\'s not ready yet"" https://t.co/G4Qwzd6csw— Clemson_Tigers (@Clemson_Tigers) June 26, 2021Even with a healthy quarterback competition in training camp, the odds still seem to be in Trevor Lawrence\'s favor and he will likely be named the starting quarterback for Week 1.     ', ""Will Trevor Lawrence be the most productive rookie QB of 2021?  When Roger Goodell read Trevor Lawrence's name as the first overall pick in the NFL Draft, it was the most predictable first pick in years. Now, months on from that moment, the NFL is speeding toward the beginning of Lawrence's first season.  How will the young rookie do? Will he be the most productive rookie quarterback of 2021?        Trevor Lawrence's history in a new system           Looking back at his college stats, it seems that Lawrence is not afraid to come out in a career firing on all cylinders. In his freshman season at Clemson, he played 15 games. In those games, he completed 65.2 percent of his passes and threw for 3280 yards, 30 touchdowns and four interceptions. As a freshman, his performance was incredible. In his final season at Clemson, Trevor Lawrence had a 69% completion percentage. Nice! pic.twitter.com/vZ6f0o9Ubk— Nachos & Analysis (@Nachos_Analysis) June 27, 2021 While the jump from high school to college is not as difficult as the jump from college to the NFL, it is still a culture shock.

If any rookie quarterback is prepared to adapt to the Jacksonville Jaguars and the NFL as a whole, it is Trevor Lawrence. Trevor Lawrence in the NFL Of course, it is not entirely up to Trevor Lawrence if he succeeds. Plenty of hyped-up quarterbacks land with a bottom-tier franchise and slowly wash out of the league.     Unfortunately for Lawrence, he has a lot working against him. He is playing for a rookie head coach in Urban Meyer. Urban Meyer has had plenty of success in college, but the NFL is a different game. NFL coaches have less control over their players than college coaches. NFL coaches have to be much more tactful when talking to the players whereas college coaches' word is law. If Urban Meyer's transition is anything less than smooth, the whole operation will become impaired. Impaired teams fall apart during the season. Currently, there are a lot of distractions on the team as well. The team signed Tim Tebow as a tight end and still has Gardner Minshew on the roster. These are two powder kegs that could create a lot of problems for the Jaguars. Tim Tebow's clout could clog up the locker room as the low-stringed player gets more attention than the starting tight end.     At the same time, Gardner Minshew is one of the most distracting players in the NFL with his haircuts and personality. Urban Meyer needs to address these problems before the team can achieve the level of focus required to be a force in the NFL.     Lastly, Jacksonville's roster is a mess and facing a high-rate of turnovers. The Jaguars currently have the fourth youngest roster in the NFL, according to nfltraderumors. This is because the team has not had many draft picks turn out to be good enough to keep around for long. This has resulted in a roster that is lacking talent in too many positions.     It seems that the team will not have too many weapons for Trevor Lawrence to throw to. If this is the case, it will limit his ability to be productive in the NFL. Urban Meyer Trevor Lawrence needs a lot to go his way in the next several months in order to put together a strong rookie season that could compete to be the best rookie season of the year. He needs Urban Meyer to work out well and he needs the distractions to cease. He also needs the roster to play like a veteran squad. Entering a season with that many questions usually leads to a rough rookie outing.If Trevor Lawrence has a good rookie season, it will be because of him and him alone.     "", ""2021 NFL Draft: Should the Jets take Trevor Lawrence or Justin Fields?  The New York Jets have just about locked up the No. 1 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. With only three weeks to go in the regular season, the Jets are 0-13, and last Sunday's 40-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks was their worst performance of the season. After a few close losses in recent weeks, currently the Jets feel farther away from a win than ever before.  After a tough 2020 NFL Season, the Jets have an even tougher off-season ahead of them. If they land the No. 1 pick, they have a decision to make on which quarterback they should take with the number one pick in the 2021 NFL Draft.        Do they select Clemson's Trevor Lawrence or Ohio State's Justin Fields?           Let's break down Trevor Lawrence and Justin Fields to determine who would be the better selection for the New York Jets.  Trevor Lawrence, QB, Clemson Trevor Lawrence has been marked on everyone's draft board since his freshman year at Clemson. Lawrence came out in his freshman year and threw for over 3,200 passing yards, 30 touchdowns, and 4 interceptions. Not to mention, Trevor Lawrence took the Clemson Tigers to the National Championship and routed the Alabama Crimson Tide. Trevor Lawrence, QB1 #16 | New York Jets. @nyjets pic.twitter.com/VQCAL0zHCi— WPX (@JaggingOff) December 7, 2020     Trevor Lawrence would have a better second year throwing for 3,665 yards, 36 touchdowns, and 8 interceptions. Clemson would fall short of winning a National Title, losing to Joe Burrow and the LSU Tigers. The loss to LSU was the quarterbacks first loss in college. Lets take a look at the pros and cons of Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence. Also Read: Complete 2019 NFL Draft Results PROS: The arm talent that he has is top notch. He can fit the football into tight windows and throws the ball with great confidence. His pocket presence is amongst the best and will be helpful in the NFL. Trevor Lawrence is patient when it comes to letting play develop. He does not panic when he is receiving heat from the defensive pass rush. Trevor Lawrence is not afraid to tuck the football and run. His size is a key attribute when he runs the football. He takes long strides and is not afraid to lower his shoulders and deliver a hit on defenders. The best thing about Trevor Lawrence is that he is a winner. He has a winner mentality and can lead a football team on and off the football field.     CONS: There are times where Trevor Lawrence is too confident in his arm talent. He has gotten away with some throws at Clemson that he won't get away with in the NFL. There has been times where he decides where he is going to throw the football before the ball is snapped. He tends to lock in on his first read. This ties in with the decision of who he is going to throw the football to before its snapped. By doing this he fails to get to his second and possible third reads. His accuracy down the sideline could be improved. The downfall to how great Trevor Lawrence is that it can get him in trouble quick in the NFL. Also Read: Complete 2018 NFL Draft Results  Justin Fields, QB, Ohio State Justin Fields came out of high school and committed to play football at the University of Georgia. He would sit behind Jake Fromm who now plays for the Buffalo Bills. Fields would not see much playing time in his freshman year at Georgia, but when he got the opportunity he would answer the call.     Justin Fields put up another Heisman-worthy performance against Michigan State on Saturday pic.twitter.com/UAyHoRbV49— CFB Film Room (@CFBFilmRoom) December 7, 2020 The best decision that Justin Fields made was teaming up with Ryan Day at Ohio State. Day has turned him into a smarter quarterback. In his first year with the Ohio State Buckeyes, Justin Fields would pass for 3,273 yards, 41 touchdowns, and 3 interceptions. He would take the Buckeyes to the College Football Playoffs where they would drop a tough game to the Clemson Tigers. The 2020 College Football Season has been up and down for Ohio State. The Buckeyes have had three games cancelled on them due to the pandemic. Fields has only played five football games in the 2020 College Football Season. In those five games he has passed for 1,407 yards, 15 touchdowns, and 3 interceptions. Justin Fields is looking to get his revenge on Trevor Lawrence's Clemson Tigers, he feels like the Buckeyes could've won the Semifinal matchup last season. Lets take a look at the pros and cons of the Ohio State Buckeyes quarterback Justin Fields.     PROS: Justin Fields has the arm talent to be successful in the NFL. He uses his baseball background to help him on the football field. His background in baseball has helped him become an accurate passer on the run. His running ability and decision making while running is what separates him from most college quarterbacks. He has added mass to his frame to be able to sustain the hits from NFL defensive pass rushers. His ability to fit the ball into tight windows is impressive. When he throws the football in the tight spaces it doesn't matter if its on the run or in the pocket. His decision making has improved from his sophomore year and his junior year. He has gotten comfortable with throwing the football away instead of trying to make the big play. Justin Fields is a winner he has only lost one game since becoming the starter at Ohio State. The best part about his game is that when he throws the football it almost looks effortless.     CONS: The biggest knock on Justin Fields is that he only has one year as a starter in college. He has shown at times that he is too quick to tuck the football and run instead of letting the play develop. There were times during big games that he would get a little rattled. One key time was on the last drive of the College Football Playoff Semifinal game against Clemson. Fields had time to throw the football but instead of letting Chris Olave make a play, he released the football and Olave broke off the route. This caused the interception that lost the Buckeyes the game. Also Read: Complete 2019 NFL Draft Results  Who is the better selection for the New York Jets? When looking at the Pros and Cons on both players, Trevor Lawrence would be the better selection for the New York Jets. Trevor Lawrence has more experience and has proven that he can play unrattled on the big stage. In three years at Clemson he has played in two National Championships. Trevor Lawrence has the ability to be the next Peyton Manning. His decision making and arm talent and just his overall knowledge at the quarterback position is amazing. Trevor Lawrence is the best quarterback prospect coming into the NFL Draft since Andrew Luck. The New York Jets would be insane not to select him with the number one pick in the 2021 NFL Draft.

Taylor Heinicke shone for the Washington Football Team as they defeated the New York Giants on Thursday Night Football. Heinicke stood in for the injured Ryan Fitzpatrick, just as he did for Alex Smith last year. The former XFL quarterback starred as his team outlasted the Giants in a thriller. The performance drew rave reviews from analysts and teammates.

McKissick speaks glowingly about Heinicke Heinicke's performance was so good that teammate and former Seahawk J.D. McKissick compared him to the Seahawks' star quarterback Russell Wilson. McKissick told reporters after the game: “He reminded me of Russell Wilson. He was calm. He wanted to make a play. He wanted to do anything it took. Only thing on his mind was winning.” Whenever anyone compares a player to Russell Wilson, it is high praise. Sometimes it's hyperbolic and brushed off as an in-the-moment line. McKissick, though, played with Wilson for three seasons, and the running back knows first-hand just how good Wilson is. In Thursday night's case, Heinicke fully deserved the praise. It is scarcely believable that he was a backup in the XFL, studying at Old Dominion before Ron Rivera rang him up last winter. Once again, Heinicke stepped up in relief of someone else and played his heart out.     Furthermore, it isn't people going overboard and getting caught with a case of recency bias. Heinicke plays like a modern NFL quarterback. He can scramble, use his legs on designed plays, and he throws with good velocity. NFL@NFLRicky Seals-Jones’ first catch with @WashingtonNFL?

Heinicke barely set his feet before unleashing a frozen rope into the endzone. It wasn't your average high-velocity pass coupled with zero accuracy. Heinicke stuck it on the top shelf, allowing his receiver to pluck it out of the air up high and come down with it.     No wonder his teammates are lavishing praise on him. It seems like the Washington Football Team will ride the Heinicke wave for the foreseeable future. His performance seemingly quashed any talk of Cam Newton or any other veteran quarterback heading to D.C.Taylor Heinicke fully deserved the adoration of the fans and his teammates. Now comes the tricky part.He must live up to these lofty expectations as the weeks go on in a long season. Heinicke, though, has defied all expectations to get here.

Who should start: Taylor Heinicke or Carson Wentz? There's no denying that Wentz has talent. His 2017 season was incredible and he has shown flashes of brilliance ever since. The biggest issue with him is inconsistency. Washington Commanders v Philadelphia Eagles Sometimes, he makes tremendous throws and incredibly athletic plays. He sometimes throws the ball directly at defenders too. Wentz can show why he was selected second overall in one play and then follow it up with a huge mistake.        His backup doesn't seem to have the highs and lows that Wentz does. He may not be capable of making some of the plays that Wentz is, but he's also not going to make as many errors, either. Commanders head coach Ron Rivera has thrown Wentz under the bus once before this season. He will have a decision to make in the near future.   The Commanders have played fairly well with their backup, but he's the backup for a reason. It will be interesting to see where they are in the standings when Wentz returns and who they decide to start then on. If Taylor Heinicke continues to win games, there's a good chance he will get the nod.     "", 'NFL Rumors: Washington Commanders make big decision regarding franchise\'s future  The Washington Commanders have officially made a change. After Carson Wentz went down, Taylor Heinicke stepped in as his backup, starting games much like he\'s done intermittently over the last couple of seasons. Going forward, regardless of Wentz\'s health, Heinicke will be the starter.  NFL insider Ian Rapoport reported the change:        ""Taylor Heinicke once again the starting quarterback for the Washington Commanders today and with Carson Wentz nearing full health- he was cleared to throw on the side this past week. My understanding is that Heinicke is expected to be the starter moving forward.""           He continued: ""Here\'s the way it is explained to me. He\'s the starter until he\'s not. In other words, until his performance necessitates a change, which no one expects, Taylor Heinicke is slated to be the starter. Think of how the team rallies around him, how they play for him. Consider that he is 3-1 as the starter."" Ian Rapoport@RapSheetFrom @NFLGameDay: The #Commanders expect Taylor Heinicke to be their QB moving foward, while the #Steelers may have found the right formula for RB Najee Harris.2From @NFLGameDay: The #Commanders expect Taylor Heinicke to be their QB moving foward, while the #Steelers may have found the right formula for RB Najee Harris. https://t.co/UPURHCsuSZ     According to Rapoport, the quarterback has played himself into the starting role. It\'s hard to imagine the stunning victory over the previously unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles didn\'t play a part in the decision.  What is Taylor Heiniecke\'s record with the Washington Commanders and other teams? As a starter this season, Heinicke has gone 3-1 for the Commanders. Last season, he was 7-8 in Washington as the starter. He also played for Washington in 2020 but did not make a start.        He previously played for the Carolina Panthers and Houston Texans, but he started one game in those two seasons while appearing in seven. He lost his only start with the Panthers in 2018. Washington is 5-5 and in the hunt for a playoff spot. They\'re currently a half game behind the San Francisco 49ers for the final NFC playoff spot and are hoping the change to Heinicke puts them over the top. If he can continue his successful record, it could very well propel them into the playoffs. It might even leave Wentz looking for a new home yet again this offseason. He was brought in via trade last offseason to provide stability at quarterback but has thus far failed to do so.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit NFL Network and H/T Sportskeeda.

Taylor Heinicke also got the start in the Wild Card round with Alex Smith sidelined. He went 26/44 for 306 yards with a TD, INT, and rushing TD.

This town loves this guy. https://t.co/YazLhLbqTd     There's no real evidence to say that Taylor Heinicke won't be a quality starter in 2021. He had some strong outings in the preseason and was once seen as a hot trade target before Week 1. Heinicke was pretty consistent in training camp as well. The Washington Football Team seemed to be taking an approach with Heinicke as if he were a rookie entering the league. He has the potential and talent, but they don't want to rush him. After a decent performance from him in Week 1 and with Fitzpatrick being out, the team should at least throw him into the fire and see if he can hold up for a long stretch. Entering the NFL, Taylor Heinicke was seen as a good pocket passer who allowed routes to develop before throwing and with accuracy. A weakness was his small frame, but he hit the gym in the offseason and packed on 15 pounds of muscle. His deep ball isn't the greatest, but he doesn't need to rely on it much. Washington has good speed in their skill players, and can play to Heinicke's strengths on the field. Add in an elite defense and Taylor Heinicke should be able to get Washington back into the Wild Card round, barring any other injuries.

Giants captains, per Logan RyanDaniel JonesSaquon BarkleyNick GatesJabrill Peppers Blake Martinez Graham GanoAnd for the first time in his 9 years in NFL, Logan was voted captain— Art Stapleton (@art_stapleton) September 6, 2021 Where Daniel Jones must significantly improve is by stopping the fumbles. He has 30 fumbles in 28 career games, which is just not good enough. His decision-making also has to improve. With one particular play that resulted in a fumble, Daniel Jones had enough time to slide on the run but chose instead not to do so.     Taylor Heinicke, Washington Football Team Taylor Heinicke is not a starter with the Washington Football Team. That honor belongs to Ryan Fitzpatrick, but Taylor Heinicke is making something of a name of being the emergency quarterback. Timeline update: WFT QB Ryan Fitzpatrick, who is being placed on injured reserve today, is expected to miss 6-8 weeks with the hip injury he suffered Sunday, per source.Taylor Heinicke time.— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) September 13, 2021 He had a stellar start last year, even in the loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the playoffs. He had to come in as an emergency quarterback replacement again in the first game of the 2021 NFL season after Ryan Fitzpatrick suffered a hip injury. Coming in, he did a fine job completing 11 of 15 passes with a touchdown.     The final verdict Everything on paper seems tilted towards Daniel Jones. He is a former first-round pick for the New York Giants, finally getting to lead his team. On the field, though, his performances have left much to be desired, especially in relation to fumbles and decision-making. Taylor Heinicke, on the other hand, is not a superstar yet. What he has done instead is consistent application and error reduction to make sure he gives the best service to the team.Comparing both of them for this match, I believe that Taylor Heinicke will lead the Washington Football Team to a victory over Daniel Jones and the New York Giants.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 2 TV Schedule     "", '\xa0""It\'s coaching malpractice to leave this bum in"" - NFL fans react to Carson Wentz\'s miserable performance vs. Browns as Commanders season ends  Carson Wentz was officially named the starting quarterback for the Washington Commanders in Week 17 of the 2022 NFL season against the Cleveland Browns. He will be making his first start since Week 6 against the Chicago Bears when he suffered an injury. While he had previously been medically cleared to play, Taylor Heinicke continued serving as the starting quarterback.  The decision by head coach Ron Rivera and the Commanders organization to return to Carson Wentz as their starting quarterback was a bit of a controversial one. He recorded just a 2-4 record in the first six weeks of the season prior to going down with an injury. Taylor Heinicke helped the Commanders firmly establish themselves as playoff contenders.        Heinicke\'s success was the main reason why they stuck with him as their starting quarterback, despite Wentz being medically cleared to return. The Commanders entered Week 17 in a crucial situation for their playoff hopes. A win against the Browns would put them in control of their own destiny in making the playoffs, while a loss would all but eliminate them from contention.           The magnitude of their Week 17 matchup is what made it so surprising that the Commanders decided to make a change at quarterback. They decided to go with the quarterback who struggled earlier in the season, rather than the one that helped get them back in the playoff race. It was a bold decision, and it epically backfired.         Carson Wentz turned in a disastrous performance as the Commander lost 24-10 to the Browns. He threw for just 143 yards and failed to throw for a touchdown, while also committing three crucial interceptions that basically lost them the game. He has now thrown six interceptions this year in just seven starts.  NFL fans quickly went on Twitter to react to the miserable performance, as well as the shocking decision to start Carson Wentz in the first place, given all the circumstances surrounding it.

Washington Commanders QB Carson Wentz     While the Commanders\' plans are unclear at this point, they have an opportunity to move on from Carson Wentz during the 2023 NFL offseason if they so choose. With the way his current contract is constructed, they have the ability to cut him off from their roster without any dead cap money counting against them. His disastrous 2022 NFL season may give them a good reason to move on from him with no financial penalty.    If the Commaders do, in fact, move on from Wentz in 2023, they will likely have several potential options to replace him. They selected Sam Howell in the 2022 NFL Draft and several other quarterbacks could be available as well. Some of the possible names include Derek Carr, Tom Brady, Jimmy Garoppolo, Sam Darnold, and Baker Mayfield.     ', ""5 things to expect from Ryan Fitzpatrick vs Taylor Heinicke QB battle in Washington  When Ryan Fitzpatrick was signed to the Washington Football Team, many assumed he would be the unchallenged starter. However, head coach Ron Rivera had different plans.  Both quarterbacks are battling for the starting position, and the team is uncommitted to declaring a winner until they are well and ready. Here are five things to expect from the battle between the two quarterbacks before all is said and done:                   Ryan Fitzpatrick vs Taylor Heinicke #1 Not a real quarterback battle The competition's main goal was to light a fire under Fitzpatrick. The goal was not to go into this with a clean slate and evaluate both quarterbacks from scratch. The goal was to create a reason to get both quarterbacks and the entire team to focus up or risk being replaced. The team wanted to show that there are no guarantees if there is going to be slacking, even at the quarterback position. .@WashingtonNFL #taylorheinicke making a classic “high/low” read on 2-17. Both of #WFT QB know how to play the position; in fact it’s the least of my concerns about this improving football team. #BaldysBreakdowns pic.twitter.com/vGgcsb1G4P— Brian Baldinger (@BaldyNFL) August 18, 2021      #2 Fitzpatrick is likely to start The Washington Football Team did not just pay Ryan Fitzpatrick $10 million (according to Spotrac) to backup Taylor Heinicke. If they were that unsure about Fitzpatrick being a fit, they would have drafted a quarterback. They skipped out on the opportunity, so they are all-in on Fitzpatrick. When the sun rises on the first Sunday of the season, Fitzpatrick should be the starter.  #3 Stakes for replacement While Fitzpatrick is practically guaranteed to start, the competition is more about setting the line for when Heinicke will be able to replace Fitzpatrick if he struggles. If Heinicke is determined to be solid in the preseason, the odds of yanking Fitzpatrick go up. If Heinicke is determined to be a clear step below Fitzpatrick, the latter will have a longer leash.          #4 Heinicke is playing for 2023 Taylor Heinicke will be playing as hard as he can, but his eyes will be on 2023. That's because, in 2023, Heinicke will be a free agent. If he can play well in the preseason, his next contract could be a raise, albeit one limited by the backup market. Heinicke knows the deck is stacked against him in this competition, but he could still get something out of it.  #5 Neither quarterback may explode in the preseason Now, through two preseason games, neither quarterback has put in an explosive performance. Both quarterbacks' offenses have been stagnant, eventually putting up 17 and 13 points respectively in their first two games. Fitzpatrick and Heinicke both performed about the same way in preseason games. They didn't put up any highlight plays, but also did not make any terrible mistakes. Washington Football Team Training CampIf this is what both quarterbacks will be, the Washington Football Team could be watchable in 2021, assuming their defense remains as dominant as it was in 2020. In 2020, they were the second-best ranked team in the NFL.     "", ""Fantasy Football Start 'Em Sit 'Em Week 14: Quarterback rankings  The fantasy football playoffs are coming. That means it is time to finalize rosters and make sure the starting lineup is as strong as possible. There is nothing worse than a fantasy football playoff loss because a player was in the lineup when they shouldn't have been.  Quarterback is a crucial position in fantasy football all year. However, weather, injuries, and other factors make it an important one to watch late in the year. Here are our Week 14 fantasy football quarterback rankings with all that in mind.        Week 14 fantasy football quarterback rankings: Start 'Em           Denver Broncos v Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs The Kansas City Chiefs were fresh off a bye on Sunday night, yet Patrick Mahomes struggled to put up any big numbers. He finished with 184 passing yards and zero touchdowns, but did add one as a runner. That run is why his Week 13 was not a total bust. That marks two rough games in a row for Mahomes. Before Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos, he also failed to get into the end zone against the Dallas Cowboys.     But there may be a blessing coming in Week 14 as the Chiefs are set to take on the Las Vegas Raiders. The two teams met a few weeks back, and Mahomes had five touchdowns along with 406 yards. So if you needed a sign to play Mahomes, here it is in the form of the Raiders defense. Taylor Heinicke, Washington Football Team Taylor Heinicke makes this list as an option for fantasy football owners who may not have a top-tier quarterback on the roster. He has been trending upward the past four weeks and has only had one game this year without a touchdown. NFL on CBS 🏈@NFLonCBSFROM 2-6 TO 6-6TAYLOR HEINICKE AND THE FOOTBALL TEAM HAVE WON 4 STRAIGHT7:07 AM · Dec 5, 20211452218FROM 2-6 TO 6-6TAYLOR HEINICKE AND THE FOOTBALL TEAM HAVE WON 4 STRAIGHT https://t.co/2MJzXyehXN     His opponent this week is the Dallas Cowboys, who own one of the NFL's worst pass defenses with 261 yards allowed per game. Factor that in with Heinicke's stretch of touchdowns and he can have a solid performance in fantasy football if he can avoid any turnovers. Again, he may not be a top option, but he is a solid choice if needed. Taysom Hill, New Orleans Saints Yes, we are talking about the same Taysom Hill who tossed four interceptions last week against the Cowboys. And yes, it's the same Hill who is dealing with a finger injury. New Orleans Saints@SaintsUP AND OVER TAYSOM HILL! 📺: #DALvsNO on NFLN/FOX/PRIME VIDEO10:41 AM · Dec 2, 20211867486UP AND OVER TAYSOM HILL! 📺: #DALvsNO on NFLN/FOX/PRIME VIDEO https://t.co/SRnlaIADYu     But it's important to remember Hill still had a good fantasy performance last week thanks to his 101 rushing yards. An interception or two is not going to sink his day because of his rushing abilities, and he may be running more because of his hurt finger. Moreove, his New Orleans Saints are taking on the lowly New York Jets this week. So expect a much better outing a week after Gardner Minshew was able to carve up the Jets defense. Hill should have a monster day both through the air and on the ground.

He has since cooled down and is now also dealing with a pinky injury. He appears to be ready to go, but that is notable in such a crucial week of fantasy football. In general, Burrow has struggled as of late. He has five interceptions in his last four games, but only three touchdowns in that span. However, he does have two rushing touchdowns in that timeframe as well. AJ Schulte@AJDraftScoutLast three weeks of charts for Joe Burrow and this...feels like a waste of their talent on offense.11:02 AM · Nov 24, 2021163Last three weeks of charts for Joe Burrow and this...feels like a waste of their talent on offense. https://t.co/6dJvgfClu3     The finger injury is just too big of a red flag in such a crucial week. Look away from the young Burrow, who remains a streaky player, healthy or not. Cam Newton, Carolina Panthers Cam Newton feels like a great option in fantasy football because of his reputation. But too much is going on with him and the Carolina Panthers to trust him this week. Newton went 5/21 for 92 yards and two interceptions in his last start against Miami. The Panthers, as a result, fired offensive coordinator Joe Brady over the weekend. The system isn't going to change, but it is clear Newton is not his former self. NFL on CBS 🏈@NFLonCBSCam Newton's 23.8% comp pct was the lowest by a QB in a game with 20+ pass attempts since Joey Harrington (22.7%) in 2004.7:07 AM · Nov 28, 202140791Cam Newton's 23.8% comp pct was the lowest by a QB in a game with 20+ pass attempts since Joey Harrington (22.7%) in 2004. https://t.co/HPIuYknkiF     This will mark Newton's third start of the 2021 season, and there are just too many unknowns for fantasy football owners. Newton is not a wise choice for the playoffs and may not be a solid starting option until 2022, if he even has a job. Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks may have brought back some faith to the fanbase after Sunday's win over the San Francisco 49ers. But the Seahawks are still 4-8 on the year, and Wilson only had 231 yards and two touchdowns in Week 13. He has continued to struggle since returning from injury in Week 10 and, like Newton, may be coasting off his reputation in fantasy football. But it's not wise to set a lineup so late in the season. Wilson is not doing enough with his legs to make up for his lackluster numbers through the air either. A matchup against Houston seems enticing in fantasy football, but there are too many question marks to have confidence in the Seahawks veteran. It is never a good sign when the main storyline surrounding a player has to do with offseason trade rumors.

The Washington Commanders beat the Philadelphia Eagles 32-21 in Week 10 of the 2022 NFL season to improve to a 5-5 record. In the process, they consigned the Eagles to their first loss of the season to drop to 8-1. But the game was not without its controversies as going into the final two minutes, the Eagles still had a chance to preserve their perfect record.  On 3rd-and-7 for the Washington Commanders, with 1:45 remaining, Taylor Heinicke dropped back for a passing play. Without any open receivers, the quarterback wisely took a knee. That would have brought up the fourth down, forcing them to punt to give Philadelphia the ball with 1:38 remaining. That was potentially enough time for Jalen Hurts to drive them downfield and score the game-winning touchdown with a timeout remaining.        Bob Pompeani@KDPompTHIS was called roughing the passer on Brandon Graham. Heinicke got up immediately as if he knew he could get the call.313THIS was called roughing the passer on Brandon Graham. 😳😳Heinicke got up immediately as if he knew he could get the call. https://t.co/4oHEaMbEDL           Instead, as Heinicke slid, defensive end Brandon Graham of the Eagles came in. He was already committed to the tackle and also slid, but his momentum carried him into contact with Heinicke. Since the quarterback had given himself up, it led to a flag for a personal foul for unnecessary roughness on the passer. This automatically brought a first down that allowed the Commanders to nearly see the game through. In the end, Jalen Hurts and the offense got one last chance, with the score still 26-21 against them, to drive downfield from near their endzone. They tried to keep the play alive with laterals but all it ended up doing is giving the ball back to the Commanders defense. They promptly returned it back for a defensive walkoff touchdown to make the final score 32-21.

Late into the first quarter, Saquon Barkley made a quick cut after the hand-off and found a big hole. He ended up turning on the speed and drove up the sideline for 41 yards.

Win or lose, Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkley both played well, and the offense held up fairly well against one of the top defenses in the NFL. Several personal mistakes by other players led to the loss, including Darius Slayton dropping a TD pass and Dexter Lawrence\'s offsides penalty that led to the game-winning FG. The fact that Saquon Barkley had more than 90% of the carries out of the backfield is a win in itself. The Giants weren\'t going to have a chance this season without him at his best and Barkley is almost there. The Giants have the Atlanta Falcons next and Barkley should have a much more efficient game. Honestly, Saquon Barkley has a decent stretch ahead of him that should allow him to shake off the rust and get back in prime form before facing Aaron Donald and the LA Rams. Twitter can throw shade and hate all that they want, but Saquon Barkley is ""back"", in a sense, and the New York Giants aren\'t going to be pushed around this season.Give props to Washington QB Taylor Heinicke as well for his amazing performance as the starter. When these two teams meet again, it should be highlighted on your calendar if Heinicke is still the starter.     ']"
16,Jalen Hurts,"['Eagles QB Jalen Hurts laments poor Monday Night Football performance  Jalen Hurts and his Philadelphia Eagles had a promising start but eventually fell 41-21 to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday Night Football. It was an electric atmosphere for Cowboys fans with the return of quarterback Dak Prescott in his first game at home since his gruesome Week 5 injury back in 2020.  On his return, Prescott was 21-26 for 238 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. He also got support from the running game with Ezekiel Elliott rushing for 95 yards, while backup Tony Pollard rushed for 60 yards on only 11 carries.

The Chiefs would come out on top 38-35 as Mahomes won his second ring.  But the performance of Eagles quarterback Hurts was something to behold, as aside from his costly fumble, Hurts was faultless on the biggest stage.        His center, Jason Kelce, recently stated that Hurts still beats himself up over it and that he told the 24-year-old that he had the best-ever performance by a quarterback in a Super Bowl. Fans saw this and trolled Kelce over his comments, with one fan saying that it wasn\'t an all-time great effort from Hurts.

Jalen Hurts and Eagles looking to go one better in 2023 Super Bowl LVII - Kansas City Chiefs v Philadelphia Eagles     Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles had a superb 2022 season and came extremely close to winning the Super Bowl earlier this year. But after such a close loss, one of two things usually happens to teams.    They either use it as motivation and get back to the big game or it takes a mental toll, and the following season is poor. It will be interesting to see which way it goes for the Eagles. The road back isn\'t exactly going to be easy. After losing a host of defensive starters plus their two coordinators, the Eagles and Jalen Hurts will have a tougher time next season.        Add in that the Dallas Cowboys have improved, so have Seattle, and then there are the San Francisco 49ers. So the Eagles ""should"" be making it to the playoffs, and once there, they can use last season\'s loss to push them to greater heights.The long road back to the Super Bowl starts at training camp in a few weeks, and the Eagles, along with Jalen Hurts, have their eyes focused squarely on winning that Super Bowl.

', 'Colin Cowherd details why Jalen Hurts\' Eagles might fall off a cliff next season - ""Blinking red lights""  If you are a Philadelphia Eagles and Jalen Hurts fan, Colin Cowherd has some bad news for you. Every year before the NFL season begins, fans determine their favorites for the upcoming season. More often than not, it is based on last season\'s performances.  However, as we all know, there are always new faces that come into the playoffs every year and a team that did well the previous season falls out. Among new teams, one could be looking at the New York Jets this season with Aaron Rodgers. But looking at teams that may fade away, Colin Cowherd picked the Philadelphia Eagles.        He began by saying:           ‘We went back this morning. And we always know that every year there are seven new playoff teams and anytime you suggest a team that made it last year won\'t this year, people freak out. But there\'ll be seven new playoff teams."" Colin Cowherd continued by saying that there might be a drop in Jalen Hurts performance due to the injury sustained last year. He also claimed the offensive line, which was the best last season, might drop in intensity given their age. He added: ""So now we have to tell you a team that we think is really good, but there are some blinking red lights. So, remember Philadelphia\'s Jalen Hurts, second year starting last year, runs more per game than any quarterback since Lamar Jackson. Got hurt. A little wide receiver drama AJ brown. Leading rusher is gone. Offensive line is really, really old.""     Colin Cowherd highlights two other reasons beyond Jalen Hurts why the Philadelphia Eagles might struggle Colin Cowherd also noted the play-caller last year was Shane Steichen, who is now with the Indianapolis Colts. They have also lost Jonathan Gannon, their defensive coordinator to the Arizona Cardinals. ""And the other thing is Nick Sirianni gave up play calling and then they got really good. Uh oh, they lost both coordinators including the play caller Shane Steichen who\'s now coach for the Colts.""

And by the way from October 8 to December 17. At Matt Stafford, at Aaron Rodgers.

He was directly responsible for both touchdowns in the fourth quarter, passing for one and rushing for another. Former Atlanta Falcons head coach Mike Smith appeared on the BallFather podcast last week. He explained to host Reggie Roberts how Jalen Hurts showcased the traits of an elite NFL quarterback in the Philadelphia Eagles\' narrow win over the Colts. Here\'s what he said: ""The great quarterbacks in this league are going to be able to find a way to win when things aren\'t always going the way that you want them to go. That to me is a sign of a guy that\'s got his team and he\'s a winner."" Mike Smith is a fan of Jalen Hurts     Smith went on to pay further compliments to Hurts, clearly impressed with his leadership of the Eagles: ""When things aren\'t going well, whether it\'s him not playing well or the guys around him aren\'t playing well, he finds a way at the end of the game and [makes sure] by the 60th minute, or if it\'s overtime, that they\'ve got one more point than the other guy."" Smith also said that it was one of the finest wins of Hurts\' young NFL career: ""That was a signature win. Even though it was against the lowly Indianapolis Colts that some people say they are. By the way, they\'re still in the playoff hunt. Right? They\'ve revived their season here in the last two weeks. But he found a way to get it done.""     He also complimented Jalen Hurts\' performance as a passer against the Colts: ""He had to throw the football. He\'s been running it all season long. But he was able to will that team to victory at the end of the game. And that says he\'s a great leader. We know he\'s a great runner. And even though he only had six or seven incompletions and they might have ugly incompletions, but still he was fairly accurate throwing the football."" Smith praised Hurts for leading the Eagles to the best record in the NFL. He predicted that they will finish the regular season strong and potentially clinch the top seed in the NFC.

', ""Why was Jalen Hurts' hail mary pass woefully short? Video shows real reason behind Eagles QB's weak attempt  Jalen Hurts turned in a spectacular performance during Super Bowl LVII. Despite his Philadelphia Eagles being defeated by the Kansas City Chiefs, a case can be made that he was the best player on the field during the game.  He recorded four total touchdowns in an incredible losing effort. Hurts statistically outplayed even Patrick Mahomes, who was named the Super Bowl MVP.        Philadelphia let a 10-point halftime lead slip away during the second half, allowing the Chiefs to complete an epic comeback victory. Following the Chiefs' final drive of the game, the Eagles took over with just seconds remaining on the clock and trailing by three. Philadelphia didn't have enough time to try to get into field goal range, so they opted for a Hail Mary instead.           On the final play of Super Bowl LVII, Jalen Hurts sent all of his wide receivers far down the field. He loaded up to unleash a Hail Mary, hoping for a miraculous jumpball to fall in the Eagles' favor. The issue was that the football only traveled about 50 yards in the air, while the receivers were set up further downfield. Hurts' pass never had a chance as it fell uncontested.      Jalen Hurts received criticism following the game for his poor attempt at a Hail Mary. His arm strength was called into question and claims were made that he may be incapable of launching such passes downfield. A video surfaced the following morning that attempted to explain why the throw fell as short as it did. Artie Schweitzer@ArtieSchweitzerJalen Hurts #SuperBowl Hail Mary throw was awful but why…clearly he stepped on #Eagles C Jason Kelce’s foot when he stepped up…bad play all around for the Eagles…2 man rush should’ve never pushed o-line 6 yards off line of scrimmage…rough end vs #Chiefs #ChiefsKingdom30347Jalen Hurts #SuperBowl Hail Mary throw was awful but why…clearly he stepped on #Eagles C Jason Kelce’s foot when he stepped up…bad play all around for the Eagles…2 man rush should’ve never pushed o-line 6 yards off line of scrimmage…rough end vs #Chiefs #ChiefsKingdom https://t.co/JBbXJCoDXf As seen in the video, Jalen Hurts appears to step on center Jason Kelce's foot while loading up on his pass attempt. This likely affected the power and trajectory of the throw, causing it to fall woefully short of the endzone.     Did Jalen Hurts cost the Eagles a Super Bowl LVII victory? Jalen Hurts Jalen Hurts made two crucial mistakes during Super Bowl LVII that contributed to the Eagles' loss to the Chiefs. In addition to the failed Hail Mary attempt, he also committed a costly turnover. During the second quarter of the game, Hurts fumbled the football while being tackled, which resulted in a Nick Bolton touchdown recovery. The score tied the game at 14 for the Chiefs.        Despite two major errors, Hurts is far from the reason why the Eagles lost the game. He was excellent for most of it, totaling more than 300 yards and four touchdowns. A more legitimate case could be made that Hurts is the reason why the Eagles weren't blown out despite giving up 38 points.     "", 'Former Eagles linebacker Ike Reese examines Jalen Hurts’ new contract extension rumors (EXCLUSIVE)  Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is expected to sign a new contract with the Philadelphia Eagles soon. After his dominating performance throughout the entirety of last season, everyone around the Eagles organization believes that Hurts is the franchise quarterback.   While the numbers around Hurts\' potential new contract haven\'t been revealed yet, it is assumed that both parties will soon agree to common ground and complete the deal soon enough.         Former Eagles linebacker and current radio show host Ike Reese joined The Ballfather podcast in an exclusive interview with Sportskeeda and spoke about Hurts\' rumored contract extension. Here\'s what he said:           ""I think even Jeffrey Lurie talked about it. They look forward to getting a deal done. Obviously, that\'s hardly talking the behind the scenes stuff, are the negotiations done? It\'ll be interesting to see if they can get this thing done before training camp.""  ""I lean towards them getting it done sometime after June 1st, so when that little dead period comes after the draft and so you almost have that storyline, when he arrives at training camp, he\'ll have new money, security, and everything else and it\'ll be a story, won\'t it? I think it gets done, It\'s just a matter of the numbers and the particulars of the contract.""     ""But I don\'t think there\'s any question that both sides are eager to get it done. They just the numbers, how much, how long the contract. I haven\'t heard much from Jalen\'s side, even from a rumor standpoint of what he may be looking for….""  ""How much will their guaranteed money be? I said, but it ain\'t started with a number to really talk about. We\'re not talking about it, you got to go at least 200 plus, guaranteed man."" The guaranteed money component will undoubtedly be a significant factor in whatever offer Jalen Hurts receives from the Philadelphia Eagles. All teams in the NFL have learned from Lamar Jackson\'s situation with the Baltimore Ravens that contract extensions with quarterbacks on rookie deals should be completed fast. The Eagles would prefer to finalize Hurts\' contract extension before other quarterbacks such as Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert, and Lamar Jackson sign new contracts since it would allow them to save some money. As for Hurts, he will likely do the best possible thing for him.

He could have very well won the MVP had he not missed games due to his injury. Hurts and the Eagles came very close to winning the Super Bowl last season, and the quarterback has proved that he deserves to get paid. Last season, Jalen Hurts had a passer rating of 101.5 for 3,701 yards, 22 touchdowns, and six interceptions in 15 games. He also rushed for 760 yards on 165 carries and scored 13 rushing touchdowns. Quarterbacks like Hurts are a rare commodity and the way he carries himself makes him a huge asset.

', 'Was Colin Kaepernick better than Jalen Hurts in the Super Bowl? Bomani Jones draws QB comparison  Jalen Hurts put on a spectacular performance at Super Bowl LVII. Despite his Philadelphia Eagles being defeated by the Kansas City Chiefs, a strong case can be made that he was the best player on the field during the game. He outplayed eventual MVP Patrick Mahomes, recording 374 total yards and accounting for four touchdowns.  Bomani Jones recently made an interesting comparison during an episode of ""The Right Time."" He compared Jalen Hurts to Colin Kaepernick by talking about how dominant each of them were during their Super Bowl defeats. He also mentions what a victory could have potentially meant for the future. He said:        ""Ten years ago, Colin Kaepernick was the starting quarterback in the Super Bowl and seven yards away from it. All right, seven yards away from what you talk about, being a Super Bowl champion.            ""Now, one of the great gifts of the Kaepernick story is if they won the Super Bowl, how does that affect everything that happens subsequently? And honestly, I also look at that in the context of how would that have affected Colin Kaepernick as a football player. Like, forget about the idea of the perception, right?"" Bomani Jones also discussed his take on whether Hurts or Kaepernick is the better quarterback: ""The best of Colin Kaepernick in like 2012 and 2013 was probably better than the best Jalen Hurts. Because the ceiling was so high on that, and remember, they\'re way too wet. No AJ Brown for Kaepernick to throw the ball to when they needed a big play.""         Jones\' take on Colin Kaepernick performing better than Jalen Hurts during their Super Bowl appearances is a bit surprising. Both quarterbacks fell just short of winning their rings, as the San Francisco 49ers were defeated by the Baltimore Ravens. Kaepernick recorded 364 total yards and accounted for two touchdowns with an interception.      This means Hurts recorded more yards, doubled the number of touchdowns, and didn\'t throw an interception, while Kaepernick did. Hurts clearly put on a better statistical performance, while their team’s results were relatively the same. As for Jones\' take on Kaepernick\'s peak being better than Hurts\', this also seems inaccurate. Was Colin Kaepernick a better QB than Jalen Hurts? Super Bowl LVII While Colin Kaepernick was excellent during the peak of his NFL career, his best season didn\'t quite measure up to Jalen Hurts\' near MVP year during the 2022 NFL season. Kaepernick\'s best statistical season was in 2013, but Hurts\' 2022 campaign was better by just about every measure.        Hurts posted a 14-1 regular-season record, while accounting for 4,461 total yards and 35 touchdowns with just six interceptions. Kaepernick\'s best season included a 12-4 record, while totaling 3,721 yards and 25 touchdowns with eight interceptions. Jalen Hurts finished in second place in the 2022 NFL MVP vote, while Kaepernick failed to even receive a single vote.

Kelce spoke about the quarterback\'s performance on the field this season on the ninth episode of ""New Heights,"" hosted by himself and his brother, Travis, on Wednesday.        Jason highlighted how Hurts\' numbers have been up there with the best as well as having the best turnover differential in the NFL. Kelce said:           ""I mean, you want to talk about MVP, Jalen Hurts, his numbers been up there with the premier quarterbacks in this league. And his playmaking ability has been up there. But look at the turnover differential or plus 14, or that or whatever it is plus third, I can\'t remember. But we\'re like astronomically higher than the next closest team. ""And part of that is our defenses create a lot of turnovers. But the biggest part of that is that we have taken care of the football. Yeah, we\'ve said this before, and I think that this is a vastly underrated part of Jalen Hurts, his football game right now is that not only is he being a playmaker, but he\'s doing it in a way that is smart.""     He continued: ""He is taking care of the football, he\'s making good decisions, it\'s hard to be aggressive, and to score points, and put up yards the way he has while also doing so by not being prone to making mistakes."" Jason added that he doesn\'t think that many others have done a better job than Hurts this season and that he has to be an MVP candidate: ""And the fact that he\'s doing that and leading our team and not putting us in negative situations. I mean, if that\'s not an MVP candidate, at the top, I don\'t know which one is so now, we\'re only halfway through the season, we got a long season left not even halfway, we got to continue to play at this level.     ""And, yeah, but you know, for the first seven games of ours, I don\'t know too many people that have done a better job than him.""    Eagles\' Jalen Hurts has been playing at an MVP level this season thus far Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Philadelphia Eagles.     Jalen Hurts is the leader of the 7-0 Philadelphia Eagles. Through eight weeks of the season, the Eagles remain the only undefeated team in the NFL.    The Eagles are also favored to win the rest of their games. In the seven games played, the QB has completed 67% of his passes for 1,799 yards, 10 touchdowns and just two interceptions. He has also rushed for 303 yards and six touchdowns on 79 carries. The Eagles are No. 1 in the league in turnover differential with +14 with the next closest team being six.     If the quarterback continues to play the second half of the season like he has played thus far, he will be closer to winning his first MVP.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Jason Kelce, New Heights Podcast and H/T Sportskeeda.

Former New York Jets QB Geno Smith     Geno Smith spent his first four seasons in the NFL with the New York Jets. He did not last long as the starting quarterback for the Jets.

Smith is currently the back up quarterback to Russell Wilson in Seattle. Geno Smith only appeared in one game in 2020 for the Seahawks.     The main reason to why Geno Smith has not carried over his success from college into the NFL is because of his turnovers. Smith has thrown a total of 36 interceptions during his NFL career. Some fans may say that the New York Jets are the reason why Geno Smith failed. This could be true, but the Jets were not on the field making the throws. Geno Smith threw for over 11,000 yards in college. He has failed to reach 7,000 passing yards in seven NFL seasons.Geno Smith will be 31 years old entering the 2021 NFL season. His opportunity window to be a starting quarterback in the NFL has shut. It will be interesting to see how the rest of his NFL career turns out.     "", ""Who is Geno Smith? Which teams has the Seattle Seahawks quarterback played for in the past?  Geno Smith is all the rage after his performance for the Seattle Seahawks against the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday Night Football.  The Seahawks backup quarterback led the team on two scoring drives after Russell Wilson went off injured. The first was a 72-yard drive that led to a touchdown. The other led to a field goal.        Ian Rapoport@RapSheetThe Geno Smith game.8:15 AM · Oct 8, 20217280512The Geno Smith game.           It was a great performance from a quarterback who had not seen much playing time with his current team prior to that. We look at the journey that has led him to this place and all the other teams he has played for. Teams Geno Smith played for before the Seattle Seahawks Geno Smith began his career at the New York Jets or, as is otherwise known, the graveyard of promising quarterbacks coming out of college. He was drafted in the second round of the 2013 NFL draft after impressing in West Virginia, where he led the Mountaineers to multiple bowl games in his college career.     In his rookie season, Smith competed with Mark Sanchez for the QB role, before being named the starter after Sanchez suffered a shoulder injury. He struggled throughout the season but showed improvement when the Jets won three out of their final four games. It was enough for him to be named starter for the 2014 season. His 2014 was a minor improvement on his rookie season. Prior to the 2015 season, he was involved in an altercation with teammate IK Enemkpali, that led to him fracturing his jaw. In his absence, Ryan Fitzpatrick took over and led the New York Jets to a 2-0 record, thereby taking Geno Smith's position as a starter.  Smith remained the backup throughout 2015 and 2016, and when he finally got his chance in the latter, he tore his ACL, which ruled him out for the remainder of that season.  In 2017, Geno Smith signed with the New York Giants, where his most noteworthy contribution was being named starter against the Oakland Raiders, which broke Eli Manning's 210-game streak as the starting quarterback. He could not impress in the game, however, and was benched the very next week.     He played the 2018 season with the Los Angeles Chargers and appeared mostly in relief roles. He featured in a total of five games during the season. Geno@GenoSmith3Love this team! Love this city! Winning is all that matters.

"", 'Russell Wilson who? Geno Smith is officially the future for Seahawks  Geno Smith and the Seattle Seahawks have officially been sent home after losing to the San Francisco 49ers in the opening round of the postseason. Seattle did score 23 points, but gave up 41 in a dominating performance by Brock Purdy and the 49ers offense.  Losing in the playoffs is obviously frustrating and not what the Seahawks had in mind. However, there are plenty of positives to take from the entire season, mainly at the quarterback position.        Geno Smith answered an important question in 2022           Los Angeles Rams v Seattle Seahawks Russell Wilson leaving Seattle could have marked a major rebuilding period getting underway. Instead, Smith won the job and picked up a statement win in Week 1 over Wilson and the Denver Broncos. The well-traveled quarterback finished the regular season with 30 touchdowns and over 4,200 yards. He was not just good, he was great. Bob Condotta@bcondottaGeno Smith says he wants to finish his career in Seattle.1060105Geno Smith says he wants to finish his career in Seattle. https://t.co/1kQjBKr4zZ     Cut to Saturday and he was trying to do the impossible, which was go on the road and take down the mighty 49ers. To Smith\'s credit, he did finish with 253 yards and two touchdowns. However, he had a costly interception in a game when zero mistakes were allowed if they wanted to pull off the upset. Yet the quarterback proved his worth this year and is still only 32 years old. Keep in mind the Seahawks have the No. 5 pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, thanks to the Wilson trade with Denver. This creates the possibility of taking a top quarterback prospect, such as Bryce Young, CJ Stroud, or Will Levis. However, taking a rookie may mean a rebuild is in fact in place. Why take an unproven rookie when a 32-year-old talented quarterback is already an option?

Yet he is not going to touch the top tier of the market, meaning he can be retained and the Seahawks can use that early pick for another position of need, such as on the offensive line. Throwing for 30 touchdowns is no fluke. He waited for his second act in the NFL and elevated a Seattle team that could have easily focused on draft position this season. A full offseason preparing as the starter will only help, which retaining him sends a message to the team that the goal is still to compete in 2023.Seeing the way Smith played compared to Wilson this season should tell the Seahawks front office all they need to know about their 2023 plans. They made a smart move and should stick with it.     ', ""NFL Draft Rumors: Seahawks want star Anthony Richardson as Geno Smith's successor in post-Russell Wilson era  Host of Pro Football Talk Mike Florio has floated the possibility of Anthony Richardson going to the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks currently hold the fifth overall selection in the 2023 NFL Draft, thanks to a trade that sent Russell Wilson to the Denver Broncos.  If that happens, Seattle hopes that Richardson can eventually become a better option than Geno Smith. The Seahawks gave Smith a three-year, $75 million contract due to his impressive performance during the 2022 season.         The West Virginia alumnus earned his first Pro Bowl selection by tallying career highs of 4,282 yards, 30 touchdowns, and a 69.8 completion percentage.           However, Smith’s new contract involves an opt-out after the 2023 season. Therefore, there’s a chance that he could last for just one more season in Seattle if he doesn’t match or exceed his 2022 numbers.  Improving from that solid season could be difficult, but it gives the Seahawks a nice option at quarterback while Richardson learns from the sidelines. If the Seattle Seahawks decide to move forward with Anthony Richardson, they must part ways with Smith before the fifth league day of 2024. If they don’t, he will earn a $9.6 million roster bonus on top of his $12.7 million base salary. Smith’s $31.2 million cap hit for 2023 limits their salary cap flexibility. What the Seahawks will get from Anthony Richardson Anthony Richardson     Anthony Richardson is among the most highly touted quarterback prospects in the 2023 NFL Draft, alongside Bryce Young, CJ Stroud, and Will Levis. While Young and Stroud are projected to be selected early in the first round, there’s no certainty where Richardson and Levis might land. The team drafting Richardson will get a dual-threat quarterback, similar to the mold of Lamar Jackson, Kyler Murray, Justin Fields, and Jalen Hurts. Richardson finished his final year at Florida with 2,549 yards and 17 passing touchdowns. He also added 654 yards from the ground and nine rushing touchdowns. Richardson ran the 40-yard dash in this year’s Scouting Combine in 4.43 seconds. He also had a 10’9” broad jump and a 40.5-inch vertical. There’s merit in Florio’s revelation, considering how Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll prioritizes the run game. Having Richardson and Kenneth Walker III gives him multiple ball carriers that opposing defenses must pay attention to.However, Anthony Richardson’s passing accuracy needs improvement. He had completion percentages of 59.4 and 53.8 in his two seasons as a starter with the Gators. That’s a work in progress if they decide to select him at number five.     "", 'Broncos should regret Wilson trade following MNF performance  The Denver Broncos shocked the NFL world when the team announced that they were acquiring Nine-time Pro Bowl quarterback Russell Wilson in a trade this offseason.  Unfortunately for Denver, their new quarterback hasn\'t been the player they bargained for. After an atrocious second-half performance against the Chargers on Monday Night Football, Wilson proved to be true once more.        Over the last handful of seasons, fans league-wide have described the Broncos as a team one [franchise] quarterback away from being a legitimate contender. With the acquisition of Russell Wilson, who\'s earned an All-Pro selection as well as a Super Bowl ring, Denver finally grabbed the quarterback needed to take the next step.           Or so the team thought. The hype around Denver\'s new roster was massive, adding Wilson to a team that has already fielded a fantastic defense. Fans were ready for Russ to \'cook\', and even began chanting ""Let\'s Ride"" as the team rode into the regular season. The Broncos\' defense has lived up to expectations, surrendering the third-lowest number of yards per game in addition to the fourth-least points. While the defense is proving to be exactly as advertised, the new quarterback in town has been nothing short of disappointing. Over the course of the season, Wilson has found himself with 5 passing touchdowns (T23), an 82.3 quarterback rating (23), and the fifth-lowest completion percentage in the NFL.     As bad as those numbers are, they\'re fantastic compared to what Wilson posted in the second-half of his most recent game on Monday, where the 33-year-old went three-for-eleven with 15 passing yards and a quarterback rating of 39.6; a rating equivalent to throwing the ball into the dirt on every snap. Jeff Kerr@JeffKerrCBSRussell Wilson was 3-of-11 for 15 yards and 0 TD in the second half and OT. 39.6 rating. The #Broncos gave Wilson $124 million guaranteed. #BroncosCountry36085Russell Wilson was 3-of-11 for 15 yards and 0 TD in the second half and OT. 39.6 rating. The #Broncos gave Wilson $124 million guaranteed. #BroncosCountry This is only the latest disappointing performance from a player Denver traded a king\'s ransom to acquire. That being the case, it\'s almost safe to say that the Broncos made a mistake trading for Wilson - a huge mistake that may linger for years.      The Broncos should be regretting the Russell Wilson trade while Seattle celebrates Denver Broncos v Las Vegas Raiders Getting the Seahawks to agree to terms with a trade for Wilson was no light task. In the end, it took Drew Lock, Shelby Harris, Noah Fant, two first-round draft picks (\'22, \'23) and two second-round draft picks (\'22, \'23). The Broncos also tossed a fourth-rounder in the 2022 NFL Draft, while Seattle gave up an additional \'22 fifth-round pick.     To put it bluntly, this is shaping up to be one of the worst trades of the decade. There\'s nothing to show Russ\' worth throughout the six weeks of the season. The numbers are bad, and so is the 2-4 record Denver now has. Even with an offensive line that ranks eighth in PFF\'s latest rankings, Wilson is unable to do much of anything. The situation is even worse when you factor in the five-year, $245 million extension Wilson received following the trade. In fact, this means Russell Wilson and the Denver Broncos will be conjoined for some time; seven years, in fact. On the other hand, the Seahawks are thriving with their new additions. Both Shelby Harris and Noah Fant are starters in Seattle, just as they would be for the Broncos. These two players have earned a PFF grade north of 70 in the early portion of the year, while Wilson finds himself under 60.     Right off the bat, this means Denver traded two starting-caliber players for Russell Wilson, who both continue to play great football with their new team. The \'22 first-round draft pick shipped to Seattle happened to be the ninth-overall pick. With such a high selection, Denver could\'ve got a stud regardless of which direction they wanted to travel in. For the Seahawks, they went with OT Charles Cross. Cross has earned a 64.6 grade in pass blocking at his left tackle position, allowing 14 pressures through six contests. We can\'t forget Drew Lock, either. While he might seem insignificant in this trade, don\'t underestimate the value of a backup quarterback. Some coaches even go as far as saying the starting quarterback of a team is the most important player, and the QB2 is the second-most important. The real kick in the face here is Geno Smith, who took over as Seattle\'s quarterback following the Russell Wilson trade.     Geno is severely outplaying Wilson. While Russ has recorded the fifth-lowest completion percentage in the NFL, Smith is currently the league-leader. On top of that, Smith has the third-highest quarterback rating; a ranking much different than Wilson\'s 23rd.Perhaps the Broncos can fix things down the road, but for now, the Russell Wilson trade remains one of the most one-sided deals over the last handful of years. Wilson\'s atrocious second-half performance on Monday night only helped solidify that.     ', ""Geno Smith career earnings: How much has the Seattle Seahawks QB earned from his NFL career  Geno Smith had himself a career resurrection with the Seattle Seahawks last season.

He started 30 games for the Jets over the course of four seasons, throwing for 5,962 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 36 interceptions. Next, he spent the 2017 season in the same city, playing for the New York Giants. Smith ended Eli Manning's streak of 210 consecutive starts that season. The signal-caller took his talents to the West Coast for the Los Angeles Chargers for the 2018 season.        Like his time with the Giants, Smith started one game and played one season with the Chargers. As mentioned earlier, the former second-round pick joined the Seahawks ahead of the 2019 season. Smith backed up Wilson, starting three games in the 2021 season when Wilson was injured. With his new deal, Smith's career earnings will see a massive jump over the next three years.

The Seattle Seahawks quarterback was drafted in 2013 by the New York Jets with high hopes but quickly faltered. By his third season in the league, Smith was relegated to backup status, and he stayed in that spot for years.        In 2019, he headed to Seattle to backup starting quarterback Russell Wilson. This past offseason, the Seahawks traded the former Super Bowl winner to the Denver Broncos. With that, Smith was left to battle it out with Drew Lock for the starting passer role. Geno Smith ultimately won, but the team was still viewed as one of the worst in the league.

The $105 million extension includes $52 million for Geno in his first year, meaning that the team should have an easy avenue to get rid of Smith in case they're not satisfied with his play when the 2025 season comes. They'll be with a quarterback developing on the wings until that day comes.When the fifth pick comes, chances are both Bryce Young (Alabama) and C.J.

Geno Smith\'s college stats Geno Smith: Las Vegas Raiders v Seattle Seahawks The Seattle Seahawks quarterback suited up for the West Virginia Mountaineers from 2009-2012. Just like most successful college careers go, the quarterback red-shirted his first season, throwing just 32 passes as a freshman. However, in 2010, his play began an upward trend as he threw for 24 touchdowns and seven interceptions as a Sophomore.        In 2011, he threw for 31 touchdowns and seven interceptions as a Junior, and in 2012, he posted the best stats of his college career, just in time for the NFL. He threw for 42 touchdowns and six interceptions, completing more than 71% of his throws. Even his 21 touchdowns and seven interceptions, had they come in his final season, would have likely been enough to at least get him a shot to make an NFL roster. That said, at the end of his college career, he showed teams that he wasn\'t afraid to win, and he didn\'t get complacent.

Here are some of the top players to target on the Week 6 waiver wire as either streamers or depth pieces.        #1 - QB Geno Smith, Seattle Seahawks           Seattle Seahawks QB Geno Smith Geno Smith continued his breakout season with the Seattle Seahawks with an impressive performance on the road against the New Orleans Saints. This is one of the most difficult stadiums to play in for road teams. He has now thrown multiple touchdowns in four of his five starts after throwing three against the Saints.         Smith is widely thought of as an early-season fluke, but it may be time to start taking him seriously. This translates to Fantasy Football. He currently ranks sixth in fantasy points among all quarterbacks and is the top option at the position who is currently on most waiver wires. #2 - RB Eno Benjamin, Arizona Cardinals Arizona Cardinals RB Eno Benjamin Eno Benjamin took over as the starting running back for the Arizona Cardinals during their Week 5 game. This was due to multiple injuries at the position. James Conner and Darrell Williams, their top two backs, each left the game early and did not return.     Benjamin stepped up by recording 53 yards and a touchdown during the game. He may have earned himself additional touches moving forward and could be the featured running back in Week 6. #3 - RB Kenneth Walker III, Seattle Seahawks Kenneth Walker III - Seattle Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III Kenneth Walker III is one of the most attractive waiver wire pickups in Week 6 of the 2022 Fantasy Football season. Seahawks top running back Rashaad Penny suffered an injury in Week 5 and is expected to miss the remainder of the 2022 NFL season. So Walker will take over as the lead back moving forward.         Walker filled in for Penny in Week 5 following his injury, recording 88 rushing yards on just eight carries. This impressive performance could be a sign of things to come this year. The rookie was one of the most dominant running backs in college football last year and looks ready to shine. #4 - WR Alec Pierce, Indianapolis Colts Indianapolis Colts WR Alec Pierce     The Indianapolis Colts were in desparate need of a second wide receiver behind Michael Pittman entering the 2022 NFL season. They selected Alec Pierce in the 2022 NFL Draft and after a slow first two weeks of his rookie season, he appears to have established himself. Pierce has now exceeded 60 receiving yards in each of his last three games while continuously increasing his workload. He led the Colts in targets, receptions, and yards during their Week 5 game and is now a legitimate waiver wire target in Fantasy Football in Week 6. #5 - WR George Pickens, Pittsburgh Steelers Pittsburgh Steelers WR George Pickens     Since Kenny Pickett took over as the starting quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 4, George Pickens' stock has risen. He has been the top receiver on the team, leading all players in targets, receptions, and yards. Pickett is expected to remain the starter for the rest of the year, so it's time to grab Pickens off the waiver wire in Fantasy Football.     Pickens has recorded six receptions and eight targets in each of his last two games while totaling 185 receiving yards. He and Pickett showed chemistry in training camp and during the 2022 NFL pre-season. They will now carry their production over to the regular season, making him a solid waiver wire target.     #6 - TE Taysom Hill, New Orleans Saints New Orleans Saints TE Taysom Hill Taysom Hill is the definition of a boom or bust player in Fantasy Football. His role within the New Orleans Saints offensive scheme is extremely inconsistent. He is fully capable of little-to-no fantasy points in a given week, but when he booms, he really booms.         Hill offers far more upside than most tight ends, especially considering how weak the position is as a whole for Fantasy Football. He exploded for 112 yards and three touchdowns in Week 5, giving him five total touchdowns this season. He is clearly worth a speculative addition from the waiver wire, possessing the potential to win weeks on his own. #7 - Carolina Panthers Defense Carolina Panthers DB Stephon Gilmore The Carolina Panthers defensive unit is a waiver wire streaming option in Week 6 as they play against the Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford has already thrown seven interceptions during the 2022 NFL season. He has also been sacked 21 times, so the Panthers defense has a great opportunity for a big week.

18,Marcus Mariota,"['What happened to Marcus Mariota? Falcons QB goes AWOL after getting benched  Atlanta Falcons quarterback Marcus Mariota has decided to take time away from the team. This comes after the announcement that rookie quarterback Desmond Ridder will be starting for the Falcons in Week 15.  Mariota was also placed on injured reserve due to a knee injury, and he is not seen as part of the franchise\'s long-term future. He was benched due to his performances, and now Ridder has got the opportunity to prove his worth in the remaining games.                     Speaking about Marcus Mariota heading to the IR, head coach Arthur Smith said this: ""That had nothing to do with the the move here, Josh, but there\'s, you know, a lot of athletes, some chronic, but nothing that\'s been an issue this season. But that\'s their prerogative. And so, you know, as this happens, you know, that\'s why we signed Logan on Saturday.""     Smith added: ""I\'ll update you, but he\'s not here right now. So, you know, just give me full transparency... I\'m not a medical expert, just telling you, it had nothing to do with the decision and we\'ll just see how the week plays out.""

', ""NFL Trade Rumors: The New England Patriots are showing interest in Raiders QB Marcus Mariota  Trade rumors are already starting to heat up early in the 2021 NFL offseason. New reports suggest that the New England Patriots are interested in QB Marcus Mariota. Many fans already know that the Patriots are looking to upgrade at the quarterback position this offseason.  It's fair to wonder whether the Patriots are looking in all the wrong places for their next quarterback. New England might be getting to the point where the team is getting desperate. The Cam Newton experiment was a bust, so the Patriots are eager to find their next passer.        New rumors have linked the Patriots to Mariota. Statistically speaking, he seems like he'd be a slight upgrade over Newton in the passing category. From a talent standpoint, the Patriots could be getting a younger, faster version Newton with Mariota.            Could Marcus Mariota be the starter in New England in 2021? Las Vegas Raiders QB Marcus Mariota It's possible that Marcus Mariota will be the New England Patriots' starting quarterback at the beginning of the 2021-2022 NFL season. Anything can happen in the offseason. If New England acquires Mariota, the team probably won't select a quarterback early in the 2021 NFL Draft.      Regardless, Mariota is not a long-term fix for the Patriots at the quarterback position. It almost feels like the Patriots are taste-testing quarterbacks until they find one that works. This formula is a recipe for complete failure in the NFL. Mariota's best NFL season was his second year in the NFL as a starter for the Tennessee Titans. Mariota also led the Titans to the playoffs in 2017, and he had an amazing run in the postseason. His experience as a starter in the NFL and his success in the playoffs could convince the Patriots to take a chance on him.

He's not exactly a hot commodity on the trade market. But if there are two coaches who can bring the best out of Mariota, their names are Bill Belichick and Josh McDaniels.      Trading for Mariota would be a short-term solution for a long-term problem. He could be a dynamic player at the quarterback position for a team that desperately needs one.

Yet another dilemma arises when you think about Marcus Mariota and Carson Wentz as fantasy picks. Who do you think can pull off some good points this weekend as the Atlanta Falcons and the Washington Commanders look to build points?  Mariota's team lost their first two games of the 2022 season (New Orleans Saints, 27-26 and Los Angeles Rams 31-27). They managed to grab a win in their latest meeting against the Seattle Seahawks (27-23).        The Commanders have seen a similar fate this season with two defeats in their first three games. In Week 1, they beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 28-22. In Week 2, they lost to the Detriot Lions 36-27. In Week 3, they lost to the Philadelphia Eagles, 24-8.           Marcus Mariota vs Carson Wentz: Key stats this season Atlanta Falcons v Seattle Seahawks  Marcus Mariota has been substantial right from the start of the season with stable individual performances thus far. The QB managed to register 215 passing yards in his first game against the New Orleans Saints.     Further, the 28-year-old covered 196 yards in his second game against the Los Angeles Rams. In the same battle, he also collected two touchdowns and two interceptions. Marcus grabbed 229 passing yards, one touchdown and one interception each when his team clashed against the Seahawks last weekend. Carson Wentz has 861 passing yards in total and seven touchdowns in his first three matches. The 29-year-old made a strong start this season with 313 passing yards, two interceptions and four TDs against the Jaguars. Philadelphia Eagles v Washington Commanders     Wentz went on to collect more passing yards in his next two games. He managed 337 yards, three touchdowns and one interception against the Detroit Lions. His recent encounter against the Eagles brought only 211 yards to his stats. How did Marcus Mariota and Carson Wentz perform last season? Since he's played fewer games, Mariota was nowhere near Wentz's overall fantasy points for the 2021-22 NFL season. Marcus racked up just 14.86 points across nine games for his former team, the Las Vegas Raiders. He averaged 1.7 fantasy points per game. Carson, however, was splendid throughout his 17 appearances for his former team, the Indianapolis Colts. He scored 258.02 fantasy points with an average of 15.2 points per game. Marcus Mariota vs Carson Wentz: Who should you pick for Week 4? Mariota has been attracting more attention from the Falcons with his ability to push the ball downfield, rushing yards, and red zone carries. With 640 passing yards already this season, he is a juicy pick for the fantasy team. In addition, he has 48.8 fantasy points so far.Carson showed a slower rate of performance in his last game against the Eagles' defense. Even if he has 64.14 points so far this season, we would recommend picking Marcus for Week 4.     "", ""Marcus Mariota Eagles contract: How much will backup QB earn in Philadelphia?  Former Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota has signed a one-year, $5 million to be the backup QB for the Philadelphia Eagles.   The second pick of the 2015 draft will spend his ninth season with the Super Bowl LVII finalists and be a backup for Jalen Hurts. Mariota signed a one-year deal with $5 million, but reputed NFL insider Adam Schefter says that the contract could be up to $8 million with bonuses.        Mariota joins the Eagles after a brief stint with the Atlanta Falcons, as the Falcons released him after one year of a two-year deal. The move saved Atlanta about $12 million in salary cap space and imrpoved their financial flexibility heading into the free agency.            So, rather than be the QB1 on an NFL franchise, Mariota will act as a backup QB for the first time since 2021, when he was a backup to former Las Vegas QB Derek Carr.  Marcus Mariota's stats indicate Eagles have solid QB depth Marcus Mariota has been a decent but not spectacular player since his NFL debut in 2015.  He started his career with the Tennessee Titans, the team that drafted him, and he was a designated starter from day one. Mariota represented the Titans for five seasons, four of them as a starter. He put up 2,500+ passing yards per season, north of ten touchdowns and a league-average total of interceptions.      Mariota has put up a stat line of 15,656 passing yards, 92 touchdowns, and 54 interceptions in his NFL career. After he left the Titans in 2020, he has been up and around the league, serving as a backup and bridge QB at various franchises.  His stat line as an NFL player isn't poor, and he brings impressive depth to the QB position in Philadelphia. The other quarterback in the Eagles QB room is Notre Dame alum Ian Book, a fourth-round pick in the 2021 NFL draft. Book has not played much in the NFL, but his college performances show that he's no slouch.  How many NFL teams have Marcus Mariota played for? Marcus Mariota has played for three teams in the NFL before his upcoming stint with the Eagles.  Mariota entered the NFL with a lot of expectations, as NFL analysts expected him to be the next generational QB. His ground game was solid; his arm was dynamite, and he shone on a pretty average Oregon State University team. However, he has yet to live up to his undeniable potential, leaving much to be desired.     He was a member of the Titans for five seasons, the first five years of his NFL career. He then moved to the Las Vegas Raiders, where he stayed for two years before moving locations again. After his stint in Vegas, Mariota signed a two-year deal to become the starter at Atlanta Falcons. However, he only spent a season in Atlanta before he was cut during the 2023 off-season. Mariota signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles in the same off-season, becoming part of Nick Sirianni's offense.     "", ""Matt Ryan or Marcus Mariota: Who is a better fantasy pick?  Matt Ryan is the Atlanta Falcons' greatest quarterback ever. So it was with immense surprise that he was traded away right before the 2022 NFL Draft.   The Boston College alum broke just about every Atlanta record. He led the team to the playoffs six times before being shipped off to the Indianapolis Colts.         Marcus Mariota, on the other hand, is a different system QB entirely. The 2014 Heisman Trophy winner never did live up to the expectations that Tennessee Titans fans had when he was drafted second overall by them in the 2015 NFL Draft.            Rather, he had a couple of decent seasons with the Titans before being replaced at QB1 with Ryan Tannehill, and he hasn't been the same ever since. Since then, Mariota has been a backup QB in NFL franchises, the Tennessee Titans and the Las Vegas Raiders.         The 2022 NFL season signaled a change for both quarterbacks. Ryan played on a different team for the first time since joining the league in 2008, while Marcus Mariota resumes as a starter for the first season since he left the Titans in 2019.  However, it's important to note that the quarterback position is one of the most unpredictable in football. The slightest loss of form can cause a coach to bench a starting quarterback for an upcoming one. This came as no surprise when on October 24, 2022, Indianapolis Colts coach Frank Reich said that Ryan had been ousted from the starting role and is dealing with a shoulder injury. Thus, Matt Ryan's time as QB1 has ended, and Marcus Mariota's is resuming. Verdict: Marcus Mariota is a better fantasy pick thanks to his availability and newfound starting role in the Falcons' depth chart.          View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Previous season statistics of Matt Ryan and Marcus Mariota Matt Ryan has been in the NFL for 14-and-a-half seasons, and he had started every game except when he was injured or just recovering from injury.  Ryan was a member of the Atlanta Falcons last season. He stacked up a stat line of 3,968 passing yards, 20 touchdown passes, 12 interceptions, and a QBR rating of 52.2. Marcus Mariota, on the other hand, has been in the league for seven-and-a-half years, where he has played for three franchises, namely the Tennessee Titans, the Las Vegas Raiders, and now the Atlanta Falcons.  Last season, he was a member of the Las Vegas Raiders, where he played as a backup to Derek Carr. As such, he didn't take too many snaps, contributing to a stat line of four yards passed, 0 touchdowns, 0 interceptions, and a QBR rating of 46.2.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Who will score more fantasy football points in 2022, Matt Ryan or Marcus Mariota? In a perfect world, Ryan will score more fantasy points than Mariota, as the two players couldn't be more different regarding a franchise quarterback. However, the NFL is not a perfect world, and many things can go amiss with the snap of a finger.  This morning, Matt Ryan was demoted to the bench, and his starting role was given to his backup, Sam Ehlinger. Marcus Mariota, on the other hand, is the undisputed starter for Matt Ryan's former team, the Falcons. That's got to hurt.         Currently, Marcus Mariota leads the much more experienced Ryan, in the official NFL fantasy quarterback rankings, with the Falcon having 110.86 points. In contrast, the newly minted Colts' No. 2 option has 102.42 of its own.Verdict: Marcus Mariota will finish with more points than Matt Ryan because of his improved performances and his status as the starting quarterback of a playoff contender, which Matt Ryan, unfortunately, cannot relate to.     "", ""Fantasy Football Start 'Em Sit 'Em 2022 NFL Week 11: Quarterback rankings  Streaming quarterbacks have become a popular strategy in Fantasy Football. It has also proven to be successful when executed properly. Quarterbacks are often the highest scoring players in Fantasy Football, so it's always important to capitalize on their position.  With the exception of a few elite options that need to be started every week regardless of matchup, the rest of the field should be closely analyzed. Especially when determining which quarterback to start in a given week. One of the best ways to do so is by looking at their recent performances as well as their direct weekly matchups to find a favorable situation.        NFL Week 11 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks: Start 'Em           Justin Fields - Chicago Bears vs. Atlanta Falcons Chicago Bears QB Justin Fields Justin Fields is quickly becoming one of the top quarterbacks in Fantasy Football. His fantasy score has finished among the top ten quarterbacks in each of his last five consecutive games. This includes finishing as the QB1 in each of the last two weeks. Fields' rushing abilities have been a major reason for his recent success. He has combined for 325 rushing yards in his last two games. He gets an opportunity in Week 11 against the Atlanta Falcons. They rank in the bottom ten in fantasy points allowed to quarterbacks.     Daniel Jones - New York Giants vs. Detroit Lions New York Giants QB Daniel Jones Daniel Jones has proven to be a solid streaming quarterback in the right matchups. He has finished inside the top ten in fantasy points twice during the 2022 season so far.         Week 11 presents an ideal situation for Jones to turn in another strong performance in Fantasy Football. The Detroit Lions are currently allowing the most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks. Marcus Mariota - Atlanta Falcons vs. Chicago Bears Atlanta Falcons QB Marcus Mariota The entire Atlanta Falcons offense should benefit from the return of Cordarrelle Patterson. He adds a dynamic element to the rushing and passing games. This includes Marcus Mariota, who is already a streaming option in favorbale matchups. He has finished inside the top ten four times this year.     Facing off against the Chicago Bears should allow Mariota to show off his dual-threat skillset. Their entire defense has struggled since trading away Roquan Smith to the Baltimore Ravens. They rank in the bottom five in total fantasy points allowed. NFL Week 11 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks: Sit 'Em Derek Carr - Las Vegas Raiders vs. Denver Broncos Las Vegas Raiders QB Derek Carr Derek Carr has been one of the most disappointing quarterbacks during the 2022 Fantasy Football season. Despite adding superstar Davante Adams to his offense this season, he has regressed in just about every statistical category compared to last year.     Things won't get any easier for Carr in Week 11. The Denver Broncos are currently allowing the least fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks. The game will also be played in Denver, one of the most difficult stadiums to play in for visiting teams. Kirk Cousins - Minnesota Vikings vs. Dallas Cowboys Minnesota Vikings QB Kirk Cousins Kirk Cousins has been relatively productive during the 2022 Fantasy Football season. He currently ranks 12th among quarterbacks in total fantasy points this year, putting him right on the borderline of being a consistent starter.         Week 11 may prove to be one of the most difficult challenges for Cousins this year. The Dallas Cowboys currently lead the NFL in total sacks during the 2022 season, so he will likely be under pressure from Micah Parsons. They also rank seventh in fantasy points allowed to quarterbacks. Jared Goff - Detroit Lions vs. New York Giants Detroit Lions QB Jared Goff     Jared Goff opened the 2022 Fantasy Football season with two top ten finishes in his first four games. This includes finishing with the top fantasy score of all players in Week 4 when he did so against the Seattle Seahawks. Goff has struggled since his hot start. He has finished outside the top 15 quarterbacks every week since his QB1 performance. It will be difficult to break out of his slump against the New York Giants. They are one of only 12 teams allowing fewer than 16 fantasy points per game to quarterbacks.

One of the most prominent fantasy disappointments thus far this year has been Kyle Pitts. Most attribute his shortage of output to quarterback Marcus Mariota's subpar performance and Arthur Smith's play-calling. Nevertheless, Pitts has not yet paid off for fantasy managers this year.  Pitts maintained his start-of-the-season troubles in the last game he played, catching just one of four passes for 25 yards. However, even if his form continues, his output might still be the result of strategy rather than talent.

The tight end seems prepared to make his one-game absence come to an end when he returns against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 6.  Unfortunately, his contribution has been underwhelming up to this point in the year, with the exception of a strong Week 3 effort against the Seattle Seahawks.     Pitts has caught only 10 of 22 targets for 150 yards through four matches this season, giving his fantasy owners 15 points. Dave Kluge@DaveKlugeAssuming he plays, Kyle Pitts is my TE3 this week.

His 15.1 aDoT ranks as the league's best.Be patient. In terms of performance, he has only had one match this season where he has recorded more than three PPR points and has yet to score a touchdown.  He might not be an extremely useful fantasy option against San Francisco in Week 6 as the 49ers have allowed the third-fewest fantasy points to opposing TEs this year. Pitts might yet again be prevented from reaching the end zone as no tight end has scored against San Francisco in through five weeks.      Should you drop Kyle Pitts? Kyle Pitts should not be dropped at this time under any circumstances. It likely took a high pick in the draft to acquire the Falcons tight end, so turning back now would not be logical.  His 2022 production's preliminary results are undoubtedly underwhelming. Still, he possesses the skills to be among the finest in his position this season. If you have him in your squad, retain him and use him frequently because he can explode if the Atlanta Falcons' offense starts to gel.

In doing so, Roethlisberger also ensured he'll be returning to the fold in the Steel City come September 9th as the starting quarterback. But after 16 fantastic years in the NFL, it's hard to imagine that Roethlisberger has too many more championship-caliber years left in him.        Currently, Mason Rudolph is the Steelers' backup quarterback. If you happened to catch his 2019 performances when filling in for the injured Roethlisberger, then you'll already know they fell beneath the high standards expected in Pittsburgh.           The experience may have aided his progression. But, personally, I don't think Rudolph is the solution in the long term. This of course begs the question of who Roethlisberger's successor will eventually be? Let's take a look. Five potential replacements for Ben Roethlisberger The Steelers have signed Ben Roethlisberger to a new contract, per @RapSheet 24th highest-graded QB in 2020 (69.0) pic.twitter.com/DQMUUJ4mEK— PFF (@PFF) March 4, 2021     #1 - Marcus Mariota (Las Vegas Raiders) Marcus Mariota 2014 Heisman Award-winning QB Marcus Mariota has struggled to live up to expectations in his NFL career. In Tennessee, his abilities seemed to wane year on year and it was no surprise to see him moved on to the Las Vegas Raiders during the 2020 offseason. Mariota has been back up to Derek Carr ever since. That being said, there are two reasons why this signing could work for the Steelers. First, Mariota is out of contract at the end of the 2021 season and has enough experience under his belt to come in and do a job and second, in the one-game viewers really got to see off Mariota last season, he performed quite well.         This performance does suggest that coach Gruden's influence on one of the best college players of all time has been paying off. Besides which, if all else fails, Mariota can simply keep the passing game simple and hand the ball off to Najee Harris, who looks destined to have a tremendous career in the NFL. #2 - Carson Strong (Nevada)        Of all the quarterbacks I've seen this week in preparation for next year's 2022 NFL draft, the Nevada Wolf Pack's signal-caller Carson Strong is certainly the closest to Roethlisberger's style of play. He is potentially a college talent that the Steelers will keep an eye on. Like Roethlisberger, Strong is a traditional pocket-passer blessed with a gun of an arm, accurate delivery, and, at 6-foot-4, a real presence behind the line. Of course, the Steelers could vouch for a host of other quarterbacks in next year's draft. But with 5,193 yards, 38 TDs and just 11 picks in his first two campaigns as a starter in Nevada, Mike Tomlin and co. could do a lot worse than Carson Strong in their quest to replace Roethlisberger. #3 - Drew Lock or Teddy Bridgewater (Denver Broncos) Denver Broncos v Atlanta Falcons     With Drew Lock now vying with the former-Panther, Teddy Bridgewater, for quarterback supremacy in Denver. One of the two signal-callers will likely be deemed surplus to requirements come the 2022 offseason. Teddy Bridgewater threw for 3,733 passing yards, 15 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for Carolina in 2020. Drew Lock managed 2,933 passing yards, 16 touchdowns and 15 picks for the Broncos. With those stats, neither player is likely to pacify a Steelers fanbase used to watching such talents as Terry Bradshaw and Ben Roethlisberger at Heinz Field. But both would be decent stop-gap options if coach Tomlin and GM Kevin Colbert feel there isn't value for them in the 2022 NFL draft. #4 - Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers) Aaron Rodgers is reportedly not happy with the Packers and he has told the organization he does not want to return to the team, per @AdamSchefter Rodgers: PFF's highest-graded player in 2020 (95.1) pic.twitter.com/xTHVEAlZBF— PFF (@PFF) April 29, 2021     Aaron Rodgers wants out of Green Bay. The Pittsburgh Steelers franchise is one of the most renowned and storied in sports. If the quarterback is granted his wish, I'd expect to see the Steelers sniffing around for the 2020 NFL MVP and the quarterback reciprocating the interest. It probably won't happen, but the Steelers have as good a chance as any other team of persuading Rodgers to join their ranks and, of course, he'd be an excellent replacement for Roethlisberger. #5 - Mitchell Trubisky (Buffalo Bills) Mitchell Trubisky: 63.5 PFF Grade in 2020T-32nd among QBs pic.twitter.com/6eOYBFqsJ6— PFF (@PFF) March 18, 2021     Bear with me here. For all the hate he receives for not being Patrick Mahomes, Mitchell Trubisky has still thrown almost twice as many touchdowns as he has interceptions in his short career. He's been to the playoffs twice and he's young enough to improve further whilst learning a more dynamic style of offense under Sean McDermott and Brian Daboll at the Bills training center. And who knows what kind of tricks he'll pick up from Josh Allen over in Buffalo, too. Like my first pick Marcus Mariota, I just don't think Trubisky is over and done with in the NFL just yet. Someone will give him another opportunity, so why not the Steelers next year if Roethlisberger retires?Trubisky lining up alongside RB Najee Harris, WRs JuJu Smith-Schuster, Chase Claypool and Diontae Johnson doesn't sound all that bad to me.Plus, it's not like Roethlisberger didn't have a nightmare season back in 2006 (18 touchdowns, 23 interceptions). Players can improve, and Trubisky deserves another shot.     Also Read: Who is Ben Roethlisberger's Wife, Ashley Harlan?      "", ""NFL Week 2 Best rookies 2022 season  Week 2 of the 2022 NFL season is now in the books. Some rookies have been balling out during the early stages of the campaign, showing the world that they belong in the NFL.   Some of these stars broke out in Week 1 and continued to impress this week, while others had their breakout party in Week 2.         Here are the five best rookie performances from Week 2 of the 2022 NFL season.           #5 Jahan Dotson Washington Commanders v Detroit Lions Washington Commanders wide receiver Jahan Dotson continues to impress, following his two-touchdown performance in Week 1.  Dotson continues to be a useful target for Carson Wentz, as he caught four passes for 59 yards and a touchdown in the loss to the Detroit Lions.  With three touchdowns in his first two games, Dotson could become an elite receiver sooner rather than later.     NFL Fantasy Football@NFLFantasyThe @Commanders have two WRs in the Top 15 in fantasy, neither being Terry McLaurin.Jahan Dotson: WR15Curtis Samuel: WR8Both Dotson and Samuel had undrafted ADPs.16310The @Commanders have two WRs in the Top 15 in fantasy, neither being Terry McLaurin.Jahan Dotson: WR15Curtis Samuel: WR8Both Dotson and Samuel had undrafted ADPs. #4 Dameon Pierce Houston Texans v Denver Broncos     After a disappointing Week 1 outing, Houston Texans running back Dameon Pierce was the team's main rushing threat in their loss to the Denver Broncos. Pierce managed 69 yards on 15 rushing attempts against a stout Broncos defense, as well as 4.6 yards per carry. If Pierce continues as the lead back in Houston, expect him to top these numbers in the coming weeks. #3 Drake London Atlanta Falcons v Los Angeles Rams Atlanta Falcons receiver Drake London had his breakout during their narrow loss to the Super Bowl champs Los Angeles Rams.     London has already established himself as Marcus Mariota's favorite target. He ended the game with eight catches on 11 targets, along with 86 yards and a touchdown. London should continue to see plenty of passes in a below-average receiver group, and he'll easily have his first 100-yard game soon.

Lloyd ended the game with two pass breakups and an interception. He also allowed just three catches on five targets for 18 yards, and came out with an 87.1 rating from PFF. This ranks him top among all rookies in Week 2 of the 2022 NFL season, but he just misses out on our top spot. #1 Garrett Wilson New York Jets v Cleveland Browns     The New York Jets shocked the world with their late comeback victory over the Cleveland Browns, and rookie wide receiver Garrett Wilson stole the show. Wilson ended the game with eight catches on 14 targets, to go with 102 yards and two touchdown catches. He's already established himself as a possible WR1 for New York, something he'll look to build upon when Zach Wilson returns from injury.

It can often be more valuable than the trade market because players can be added without giving away other roster pieces. Fantasy managers who pay close attention to the Waiver Wire can often implement a winning strategy around it.  Week 10 of the 2022 NFL Fantasy Football season presents several valuable targets on the Waiver Wire. Some can be utilized as fill-ins for injured players and bye weeks. Others are worth rostering as speculative adds for their potential to carve out a larger role within their offense in the near future.                   #1 - QB Marcus Mariota, Atlanta Falcons Atlanta Falcons QB Marcus Mariota Marcus Mariota has been consistent in the rushing game for the Atlanta Falcons, making him a relevant quarterback in Fantasy Football. He has recorded at least five rushing attempts in every game this season while eclipsing 30 yards five times and totaling three rushing touchdowns.  The last time he faced the Carolina Panthers, he set a season-high in fantasy points. He will play them again in Week 10.          #2 - RB Elijah Mitchell, San Francisco 49ers San Francisco 49ers RB Elijah Mitchell     Elijah Mitchell has appeared in just one game during the 2022-23 NFL season. He was injured in Week 1 against the Chicago Bears and was placed on the injured list. He was recently designated to return, so he should be added off the Waiver Wire in any league he was dropped from. While Christian McCaffrey will be the lead back, the San Francisco 49ers are known to use multiple running backs.  #3 - RB Chase Edmonds, Denver Broncos Denver Broncos RB Chase Edmonds     The Denver Broncos acquired Chase Edmonds from the Miami Dolphins at the 2022 NFL trade deadline. His role with his new team is yet to be defined, but he's worth a speculative addition from the Waiver Wire. The Broncos have reportedly been left dissatisfied with Melvin Gordon III and Latavius Murray, so Edmonds has a chance to emerge as their lead running back.  #4 - RB Rachaad White, Tampa Bay Buccaneers Tampa Bay Buccaneers RB Rachaad White     Rachaad White has been more involved in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers gameplan as the 2022-23 NFL season continues. He exceeded 10 touches for the first time this year in Week 9. While he doesn't appear to be a threat to take over the lead role from Leonard Fournette, he should continue to increase his workload. His receiving skills also make him an interesting target on the Waiver Wire.  #5 - WR Mecole Hardman, Kansas City Chiefs Tennessee Titans v Kansas City Chiefs     When the Kansas City Chiefs moved on from Tyreek Hill during the offseason, many believed Mecole Hardman would take over as their big-play threat. He failed to make much of an impact in the Chiefs' first few games but has exploded recently for five touchdowns in his last three games. He's worth a Waiver Wire addition in the high-powered Chiefs offense.      #6 - WR Terrace Marshall Jr., Carolina Panthers Carolina Panthers WR Terrace Marshall Jr.     Terrace Marshall Jr. has received an increased role within the Carolina Panthers' offense since Robbie Anderson was traded to the Arizona Cardinals. He has responded by recording 140 yards on 15 targets with a touchdown over the last two weeks. He will also face off against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 10. They currently allow the most fantasy points per game to opposing wide receivers.  #7 - WR Christian Watson, Green Bay Packers Green Bay Packers WR Christian Watson     Christian Watson has been relatively disappointing this year after being selected in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft. He has seen limited action so far this season, but his workload is likely to increase following a significant injury to Romeo Doubs. Watson is worth a speculative addition from the Waiver Wire, especially with Aaron Rodgers seeking a new playmaker in their offense.  #8 - TE Greg Dulcich, Denver Broncos Denver Broncos TE Greg DulcichGreg Dulcich entered the Denver Broncos' lineup in Week 6. He has responded by turning in three consecutive productive performances. He has totaled 12 receptions on 17 targets for 182 yards and a touchdown. The lack of consistent options at tight end in Fantasy Football makes Dulcich a particularly attractive target on the Waiver Wire in Week 10.     ""]"
19,Ryan Tannehill,"[""WATCH: Titans fan burns Ryan Tannehill's jersey after interception-laded performance against Bengals  Ryan Tannehill flamed out on Saturday against the Cincinnati Bengals in the Tennessee Titans' 16-19 divisional round playoff loss. One of his fans took that phrase literally. While sitting around a campfire, the fan, who was wearing the quarterback's jersey, took it off and dropped it in the fire. The jersey became one with the fire in a matter of seconds.  The way the fan dropped it says a lot about his feelings about the situation. He wasn't angrily thrashing around before ripping off the jersey and throwing it into the fire with force. He did it with an attitude that said he was not surprised, but disappointed. Above all, he was beyond burnt out on the quarterback, and apathetically thought it was time to cut him loose.

The tweet currently has 70 retweets, 42 quote tweets, and 267 likes. Ryan Tannehill's flameout as Titans lose to Bengals Heading into the game, some thought the team could suddenly catch fire with AJ Brown, Derrick Henry and Julio Jones back on the field together for the first time in months. However, Henry and Tannehill dropped the ball.     Despite receiving 20 carries, Henry only reached 62 yards and a touchdown. This would be a slightly-disappointing game for an average back, but for Derrick Henry, it was an outright failure. It looked even worse when his backup, D'Onta Foreman, outgained Henry's total yardage with just four carries. Foreman had 66 yards on four carries.     However, the other failure rivaling Henry's was that of Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill set a bad tone for the day when his opening throw of the game was an interception. Just seven seconds and one snap into the game, the Titans lost their advantage in getting the ball first.     If it wasn't for the Titans' defensive line, this game likely would have gotten ugly. Joe Burrow was sacked nine times. That said, he still outplayed the veteran. Now eliminated, where do the Titans go from here?

Either Aaron Rodgers or Russell Wilson would be a big upgrade at the quarterback position and would be the only logical way to get substantially better this offseason. Between the Bills, the Chiefs and now the Bengals toting explosive young quarterbacks, Tannehill may have hit his ceiling with the Titans. The former Dolphins quarterback can make waves with a loaded roster during the regular season, but his playoff performances have been uninspired, and every road has led to a mid-playoff exit. Will the Titans now be entering the Rodgers-Wilson sweepstakes?     "", ""Is Ryan Tannehill playing today vs. the Bengals in Week 12?  Since making his injury-related comeback about two weeks ago, Tennessee Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill has been on a terrific ride. On Thursday, November 17, the seasoned player and the Titans defeated the Green Bay Packers 27-17 by throwing for a season-high 333 yards and two touchdowns. Will he suit up for the Cincinnati Bengals game today?  Tannehill is anticipated to play tonight against the Cincinnati Bengals. The team has won four of their previous five games, including one with a 27-17 triumph over Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers in Week 11. They have been impressive thus far this season.

The Titans are in the perfect position to face the Cincinnati Bengals again since Ryan Tannehill is fresh from his finest throwing performance of the year. The Bengals' most recent visit occurred in the postseason in January, and everyone knows what transpired. In that game, Tannehill threw three interceptions, and the defeat was so agonizing that he admitted seeking therapy to cope.

But there's no disputing the much curiosity that surrounds his performance in this one.  He is playing after his best offensive performance so far, a 333-yard, two-touchdown showing against the Packers, which is a huge plus coming into this game. Since Week 2 of the last campaign, when he passed for 347 yards against the Seattle Seahawks, Week 11 was his highest number of passing yards in a game.     Tannehill has contributed enough to the Titans' 6-2 record in games this season that he has started.

He should be fine for over 200 yards and one touchdown; if he can add another or score on a goal-line run, that would be a decent quarterback start.     "", ""Reasons why Malik Willis should start over Ryan Tannehill  The Ryan Tannehill era has been mired in regular season glory and playoff disappointment. Since arriving in Tennessee in 2019, Tannehill has made this once moribund franchise relevant again. With three consecutive postseason appearances under his belt, he has done his best to bring the Titans a Lombardi Trophy for the first time in their relatively short history.  Ultimately, regardless of his attempts, Tennessee fans have continually dug their heads into their hands in disgust as Tannehill has put up underwhelming performance after underwhelming performance.        Although the former Pro Bowler is set to return to the field as Tennessee's leader, Malik Willis, their recent third-round draft selection, appears to be lurking in the shadows. Unofficially, Willis seems to be the guy waiting in the wings as their quarterback of the future. Nevertheless, we'll tell you why that future needs to start now.           #1 - Start the growing pains early Tennessee Titans v Baltimore Ravens It was no surprise that Malik Willis drew the first preseason start of the year against the Baltimore Ravens. Both sidelines, however, were pleasantly surprised with what Willis had to offer.     In what amounted to only a short sample size, Willis was pretty terrific. The former collegiate star out of Liberty completed six of his 11 passes for 107 yards, throwing for an average of 9.7 yards per attempt. Willis, to his credit, also showed off his wheels, rushing the ball five times for 38 yards. It was about as dynamic a performance as he could have. Now, as a direct result, Tannehill's grip on the starting gig is beginning to loosen. Although allowing him to keep his spot in the lineup would probably lead to more wins this season for the Titans, it could stunt Willis' overall growth. At this point, we know what Tannehill is and what he isn't. Willis should be thrown into the fire and allowed to take his lumps early on. Sitting behind Tannehill would be a wrong move on Tennessee's part. #2 - Ryan Tannehill won't be here for the long haul     AFC Divisional Playoffs - Cincinnati Bengals v Tennessee Titans Realistically, the Titans will likely look to push Tannehill out the backdoor at the end of the 2022 season. With no talks of a possible contract extension, paired with Tannehill recently turning 34, the hourglass on his time in Tennessee is rapidly wasting away. In three full seasons as the Titans starter, Tannehill has enjoyed monumental success in the regular season, leading the Titans to double-digit victory totals in 2020 and 2021. However, when the postseason lights have shined their brightest, he has played impetuously.     The final straw that broke the camel's back was last season's divisional-round matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals. Despite being considered the favorites, Tannehill flat-out stunk up the joint, throwing for just 220 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions. Tennessee should look to replace him now with Malik Willis, who is undoubtedly their quarterback of the future. #3 - Malik Willis falls in line with the new-age quarterbacks Tennessee Titans v Baltimore Ravens Admittedly, Ryan Tannehill is a more than respectable quarterback and has been so for over a decade. However, he's seemingly missing something.     As we gaze upon the current signal-callers around the league, he fits the mold of yesteryear quarterbacks. The former Pro Bowler is accurate in the pocket but seldom uses his legs to get himself out of harm's way while picking up huge chunk yards for the Titans. On the other hand, Willis appears to look like a more modern-day quarterback. During his lone preseason outing, Willis not only threw the ball for 107 yards but also rushed for 38 impressive yards in his limited time. With his ability to threaten opposing defenses with his gigantic arm and quick feet, Willis is a much bigger threat out on the field than Tannehill could ever be.

If his first preseason outing is anything to go by, he is already doing well on his learning curve.  The Tennessee Titans took him in the third round this year because his arm talent and athleticism were just too good to overlook. There was some surprise when Willis fell to the third round. Many expected him to go to a quarterback needy team like the Pittsburgh Steelers. But the Steelers drafted Kenny Pickett in the first round.        Desmond Ridder was the second quarterback to be selected and he went to the Atlanta Falcons in the third round. The Titans were no doubt delighted when Willis was still available with the 86th pick.

However, he is not quite ready to start in the NFL and he has not supplanted Ryan Tannehill. But the Titans will have a lot more confidence in Willis going forward, should something happen to Tannehill. Of course, as the coaching staff has pointed out, the young quarterback still has a lot to learn. One thing that Malik Willis will need to improve upon is his work from under center. He got used to the shotgun in college while at Liberty, so his dropbacks need to become more fluent for him to become starting NFL material.     Here\'s what Titans head coach Mike Vrable said to reporters after Willis\' performance: ""He needs to try to throw the ball when guys are open, be more decisive. We\'ll evaluate that, see if there\'s a timing issue or what\'s going on. Wanted to get him out there, see how he responds. There were some good plays and obviously some plays we\'re gonna have to look at the timing on the release and if we\'re making the right decisions."" Mike Herndon@MikeMiraclesLast night was largely a confirmation of everything that was in Malik Willis’ draft profile. Electric runner, huge arm, big time playmaking ability. Not comfortable hanging in the pocket or throwing over the middle of the field.The good news is that the negatives are fixable.48325Last night was largely a confirmation of everything that was in Malik Willis’ draft profile. Electric runner, huge arm, big time playmaking ability. Not comfortable hanging in the pocket or throwing over the middle of the field.The good news is that the negatives are fixable.     While most modern quarterbacks are good with their feet, the hallmarks of a good signal-caller are timely releases and pocket presence. Malik Willis needs to improve his throwing down the middle of the field and make sure he gets the receivers open. Furthermore, he needs to be able to stay in the pocket longer and extend plays. The pressure will be much more intense in regular-season games.As encouraging a debut as it was, and as much as it points to potential, there is still a long way to go for Willis. But don\'t be shocked to see him develop into a household name over the next few seasons.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit NFL.com and H/T Sportskeeda.

Injury update on Titans QB\xa0  The Tennessee Titans take on the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 18 in the AFC South title decider but will be without Ryan Tannehill. The veteran quarterback hasn't featured in the team's last two games due to an ankle injury he suffered against the Los Angeles Chargers.  Ian Rapoport@RapSheetThe #Titans have placed QB Ryan Tannehill on Injured Reserve, almost certainly ending his season. OLB Bud Dupree and LB Zach Cunningham, too.1578151The #Titans have placed QB Ryan Tannehill on Injured Reserve, almost certainly ending his season. OLB Bud Dupree and LB Zach Cunningham, too.        Tannehill underwent surgery and was hoping to recover in time to play tonight against the Jaguars in the AFC South title decider. However, the team placed him on the IR, effectively ending his season.           Who is the Titans' starting QB tonight against the Jaguars in Week 18 in Ryan Tannehill's absence? Tennessee Titans QB Joshua Dobbs Rookie Malik Willis was the team's backup quarterback for the majority of the 2022 season. He featured in eight games for the Titans, starting three, however, he was benched for the team's Week 17 clash against the Dallas Cowboys in favor of Joshua Dobbs.     NFL@NFLFirst career TD pass for @josh_dobbs1 #DALvsTEN on Prime VideoAlso available on NFL+ bit.ly/3Ww62cW2909333First career TD pass for @josh_dobbs1 ‼️#DALvsTEN on Prime VideoAlso available on NFL+ bit.ly/3Ww62cW https://t.co/apTR2IYLCI Dobbs had a decent outing against the Cowboys. He threw for 232 yards and one touchdown with one interception in the Titans' 27-13 loss. The quarterback's performance was impressive enough for the team to name him as the starter for the game against the Jaguars. This is a huge opportunity for him to prove himself and stake a claim for next season.     "", ""What happened to Malik Willis? Reason why Titans QB isn't playing tonight vs. Cowboys revealed  Malik Willis was listed as the backup quarterback to Joshua Dobbs when the Tennessee Titans took on the Dallas Cowboys today in Thursday Night football. It was seen as quite the surprise because Dobbs only joined the team on December 21, whereas Willis has been the regular backup to Ryan Tannehill.  However, circumstances have dictated why they have ended up in this situation. The Tennessee Titans have a critical game coming up next week. They play the Jacksonville Jaguars, with both teams tied with a 7-8 record. Even if the Titans lose this week, they will only be one game behind going into next week if Jacksonville wins.        Defeating the Jaguars will clinch the division for them. So this game is basically a free hit for them.            Then there is the situation where Ryan Tannehill has been placed on injured reserve. This means that they do not expect him to be back either next week or deep into the playoffs (if they get there). So it comes down to Joshua Dobbs and Malik Willis. They need both their quarterbacks to be familiar with the offense going into next week. Hence, it made a lot of sense for Dobbs to start in this game to get some action with the offense and familiarize himself.     Malik Willis is expected to be back next week Malik Willis is expected to return for the game next week against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Unless there is a mind-blowing performance by Joshua Dobbs this week, this situation is not expected to change going into next week. Jeremy Fowler@JFowlerESPNMy understanding of Titans’ QB outlook for rest of the year *Team figured it doesnt hurt to get a look at what Josh Dobbs can do in a game that doesn’t hurt them in standings*Barring eye-opening performance from Dobbs, Malik Willis will most likely start vs. Jaguars12437My understanding of Titans’ QB outlook for rest of the year *Team figured it doesnt hurt to get a look at what Josh Dobbs can do in a game that doesn’t hurt them in standings*Barring eye-opening performance from Dobbs, Malik Willis will most likely start vs. Jaguars Malik Willis has not had the best of seasons, starting as the backup quarterback for Ryan Tannehill. He has not thrown for a single touchdown this season but has thrown three interceptions. This is not a good look for any quarterback.     Particularly concerning for the Titans was his performance last week against the Houston Texans. They played the worst team in the NFL and instead of breaking their losing streak, he threw for zero touchdowns and two interceptions. He finished with a 34.5 passer rating. Jordan Pun@Texans_ThoughtsThe Titans aren’t giving up on Malik Willis after 3 starts in which he only threw 49 total passes.That’s not a good enough sample size to evaluate anyone, especially a guy like Willis who is viewed as a project.They’re resting most of their starters for Week 18… that’s it.391The Titans aren’t giving up on Malik Willis after 3 starts in which he only threw 49 total passes.That’s not a good enough sample size to evaluate anyone, especially a guy like Willis who is viewed as a project.They’re resting most of their starters for Week 18… that’s it. Next week, if he does play as he is expected to, he will come up against an ascendant Jacksonville Jaguars with the divisional top seed on the line. Facing him as the opposing quarterback will be Trevor Lawrence, who has started to show glimpses of his potential this season. If he has to prove himself, Malik Willis will have to do it with the season on the line.     "", ""3 NFL teams that desperately need a new quarterback  The quarterback is the heart of an NFL team's offense. A good quarterback could lead to many successful seasons and even a dynasty. However, a bad quarterback could be just as detrimental to a team.  While most quarterbacks that are currently in the NFL are satisfactory, some have not performed well recently. Some of these poor performances can be attributed to injuries, inexperience, or simply bad luck.        But there are a few quarterbacks that have consistently had sub-par performances. These players are directly responsible for bringing down their team's results. Here are three NFL teams that desperately need a new quarterback.            Tennessee Titans - Ryan Tannehill Ryan Tannehill The Tennessee Titans have relied upon Ryan Tannehill as their quarterback for the last three seasons. His performances in the NFL have been far from spectacular though. Tannehill finished 16th in touchdowns thrown (21), 19th in yards per pass attempt (7.0), and 22nd in passing yards per game (219.6) last season. In addition, he has racked up below-average stats for the entirety of his nine-year career with the Miami Dolphins and the Titans.      His career average for touchdowns thrown is 22.1, yards per attempt is 7.3, and yards per game is 231. Clearly, Tannehill has a history of underwhelming performances. The Titans already have an explosive rush offense, led by running back Derrick Henry. However, to get their team to another level, the Titans need to find an elite quarterback to replace Tannehill. Steve Death@DeathOfLife01@mandisaofficial We did trade a big key piece of our offense and Tannehill has been @mandisaofficial We did trade a big key piece of our offense and Tannehill has been 😖  Miami Dolphins - Tua Tagovailoa Tua Tagovailoa     The Miami Dolphins had a strange 2021 season. After winning their first game of the regular season, the Dolphins went on a seven-game losing streak.  Just when everyone thought they were out of the playoffs and a winning season was impossible, they won seven games in a row to make their record 8-7.  They finished the regular season with a 9-8 record, but this was still not enough to go to the playoffs, as the Buffalo Bills won the division and the New England Patriots took the wildcard spot with one more win than the Dolphins. Tagovailoa's career stats are worse than Tannehill's. He averages only 194.2 yards per game and 6.6 yards per pass. Tagovailoa also has a very high risk of injury. He is yet to start a complete season for his team, playing just 10 games in the 2020 NFL season and 13 in the 2021 season. One can't completely blame Tagovailoa for the wild fluctuations in the team's season, especially since he was out for part of the losing streak. However, after two seasons with the Dolphins, he is yet to take them to the playoffs.      In fact, the last time Miami made the NFL playoffs was 2016. Finishing with a winning season is geat, but if the Dolphins want to make the playoffs, they need to find someone better than Tagovailoa.  Baltimore Ravens - Lamar Jackson Lamar Jackson The Baltimore Ravens have a unique player at quarterback. Lamar Jackson is a dual-threat quarterback, with his running abilities equaling or exceeding his throwing abilities. Being able to run is a great trait to have if you are a quarterback. It can allow you to get out of pressure and avoid sacks, and possibly, subsequent fumbles. However, with Jackson, his traditional capabilities as a quarterback are hindered because of his abilities as a psuedo-running-back.     Jackson has low average passing yards per game - just 171.8 yards over four seasons. He also has an interception percentage of 2.3 percent. Jackson is reluctant to throw the ball and is more inclined to run it. This, in turn, causes the Ravens to fail miserably in situations where throwing the ball is a necessity. In the 2021 NFL season, the Ravens lost five games by three or less points. They also lost two overtime games. When the Ravens needed yardage in a short span of time, their quarterback couldn't deliver, and it cost them a playoff spot last season. The Ravens need to move on from Jackson, or use Jackson complimentarily with another more traditional quarterback.Jon@jond2546All because a qb can run doesn’t mean he’s a better QB just ask Lamar Jackson aka a running back92All because a qb can run doesn’t mean he’s a better QB just ask Lamar Jackson aka a running back     "", ""Ranking the top 5 NFL free agents available\xa0  Free agency has passed and the 2022 NFL Draft has been and gone. The biggest names, the sought-after players, the ones that command hefty price tags, have all found their homes for the upcoming season. While the most obvious names are now gone, that doesn’t mean there aren't any options still available out there.  There are veteran stars coming off a few bad seasons, these last year's men are desperate to relive their glory days. Not to mention injury-riddled players, defiant to the very end and determined to make a comeback.        Here are the best five NFL free agents left on the market:           #5. Julio Jones The market value of Julio Jones should not entirely be tied to the performance of quarterback Ryan Tannehill. After dominating the NFL for a decade as a member of the Atlanta Falcons, Jones was a monster when he had Matt Ryan throwing him the ball. Granted, in his final year, he did slow down. However, once he arrived in Tennessee, Jones was a shell of his former self. NFL Stats@NFL_StatsActive players with the most career receiving yards…Julio Jones - 13,330Antonio Brown - 12,291DeSean Jackson - 11,110DeAndre Hopkins - 10,581AJ Green - 10,278TY Hilton - 9,691Mike Evans - 9,301Rob Gronkowski - 9,286Emmanuel Sanders - 9,245Travis Kelce - 9,00644854Active players with the most career receiving yards…Julio Jones - 13,330Antonio Brown - 12,291DeSean Jackson - 11,110DeAndre Hopkins - 10,581AJ Green - 10,278TY Hilton - 9,691Mike Evans - 9,301Rob Gronkowski - 9,286Emmanuel Sanders - 9,245Travis Kelce - 9,006     In 2021, Jones registered career lows in receiving yards at 434 and yards per game at 43.4. Seldom did Jones have the ball thrown his way, he was targeted just 48 times. He caught only one touchdown pass off 31 receptions. He may have lost a step or two but Jones is still a big, physical receiver with great hands. His days of being the number one option might be over, but as a secondary receiver on a team with Super Bowl aspirations, Jones can fill in nicely. At the age of 33 he could be signed at a discount. #4. Will Fuller Miami Dolphins v Houston Texans     No player in the NFL, perhaps apart from Deshaun Watson, needs to rehabilitate their image quite like Will Fuller. During his brief yet wildly productive career, Fuller’s name has popped up on the injury report more than he would like. In 2020, he got through the majority of the season injury-free. Despite staying out of the medical tent, his season stats have an enormous asterisk on them due to a failed PED test. In his first season in a new destination, Fuller spent the vast majority of his time sequestered on the sidelines due to injuries. After playing in only two games, the Miami Dolphins let him go. The speedy receiver is currently languishing in the open market. Some teams will be apprehensive about signing Fuller to a deal. Is he past his injury woes? Was his PED suspension an honest mistake? Fuller won’t come with a hefty price tag. Super Bowl contending teams can get their hands on a receiver who’s more than capable of taking the top off a defense for minimal cost.     #3. Trey Flowers Indianapolis Colts v Detroit Lions Signing Trey Flowers to a massive deal wouldn’t be the wisest decision any NFL team has ever made. However, that isn’t because of his performance. When healthy, Flowers’ has been one of the best defensive linemen in the league. But, therein lies the problem, “when healthy.” Over the past two seasons, Flowers has missed more than half of the year due to countless injuries. While it appears as though his body is struggling with the rigors of the game, at 29, he should have plenty left in the tank.     From 2017 to 2019, Flowers was a menace up front, recording 21 sacks during that stretch for both the New England Patriots and the Detroit Lions. If he can stay healthy, he would be a steal for anyone willing to take a chance on him. #2. James Bradberry New York Giants v Los Angeles Chargers James Bradberry was the lone bright spot on a horrific New York Giants team in 2020 with 3 interceptions, 18 passes defended and 54 combined tackles. After nabbing his first NFL Pro Bowl appearance, Bradberry produced similar numbers in 2021 with 4 interceptions, 17 passes defended and 47 combined tackles.     Defensive players often find themselves at a disadvantage. With the NFL openly prioritizing offensive numbers, defenders can struggle to impact the game and don't often get the praise they deserve. Bradberry’s numbers should make him a salivating prospect for numerous teams, but when you add his durability, missing only two games in five years, Bradberry becomes incredibly valuable. #1.

Despite his otherworldly talents, Beckham Jr. has failed to record a thousand-yard season since 2019. Nevertheless, his mediocre numbers are also an indictment of poor quarterback play.

The Chiefs got off to a fast start, with Mahomes throwing a touchdown pass on each of their first their offensive possessions. They quickly jumped out to a 21-3 lead in the first half of the game.  Everything changed from that point forward. The Chiefs managed just one field goal for the rest of the game while being outscored 24-3 in a 27-24 loss in overtime.

Regardless of the circumstances, that is an unacceptable stat line for a player of his caliber and getting paid as much as he is. He is the highest paid player in NFL history. The way the Chiefs have built their team and designed their scheme, they rely on Mahomes to be spectacular. Their defense and rushing game are both below average, so it's all on Mahomes and the passing attack. He is capable of carrying them to victories, as he has done plenty of times, but these two performances are legitimate causes for concern. The Chiefs aren't built to survive bad games from Mahomes, they need him to be elite in every game.

Jalen Hurts and Eagles looking to go one better in 2023 Super Bowl LVII - Kansas City Chiefs v Philadelphia Eagles     Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles had a superb 2022 season and came extremely close to winning the Super Bowl earlier this year. But after such a close loss, one of two things usually happens to teams.    They either use it as motivation and get back to the big game or it takes a mental toll, and the following season is poor. It will be interesting to see which way it goes for the Eagles. The road back isn\'t exactly going to be easy. After losing a host of defensive starters plus their two coordinators, the Eagles and Jalen Hurts will have a tougher time next season.        Add in that the Dallas Cowboys have improved, so have Seattle, and then there are the San Francisco 49ers. So the Eagles ""should"" be making it to the playoffs, and once there, they can use last season\'s loss to push them to greater heights.The long road back to the Super Bowl starts at training camp in a few weeks, and the Eagles, along with Jalen Hurts, have their eyes focused squarely on winning that Super Bowl.

', 'Patrick Mahomes jumps on Chiefs backup QB Chad Henne hype train after veteran puts on admirable performance against Jaguars  Patrick Mahomes suffered a nasty ankle injury during the first quarter of the Kansas City Chiefs\' Divisional Round bout with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He ultimately returned to the game, but backup Chad Henne had to step in.  Henne performed admirably in Mahomes\' absence -- so much so that Mahomes took to Instagram to share a meme praising his backup.        The meme shared by Patrick Mahomes on Instagram           Henne ended up throwing for 23 yards and a touchdown on five pass completions during Mahomes\' absence. Eventually, Mahomes returned with a heavily taped ankle and threw his second touchdown of the game. Mahomes was able to finish the game, but it was clear he was suffering. Had he been unable to finish the game, the Chiefs would have had to turn to Henne for the remainder of the match.        In Mahomes\' opinion, that would have been fine and Henne would have risen to the occasion.  Will the Kansas City Chiefs have Patrick Mahomes for the AFC title game? After the game, it was revealed that Mahomes officially suffered a high ankle sprain. This often takes a lot of time to recover from, so it\'s a bit miraculous that he was able to return to the game at all.        ESPN analyst Adam Schefter tweeted: ""MRI today confirmed that Chiefs’ QB Patrick Mahomes suffered a high ankle sprain during Saturday’s win over the Jaguars, per league source. \'Nothing more than that,\' said one source, and Mahomes has said he plans to play in next Sunday’s AFC Championship Game."" That doesn\'t bode well for a matchup with either the Cincinnati Bengals or Buffalo Bills. Both teams present great threats and no Mahomes or a hobbled Mahomes is going to make life difficult.

Mahomes even thanked her performance for helping them turn the game around during the second half.  While on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" Kimmel addressed Rihanna\'s pregnancy and revealed that the singer should probably name her baby after Patrick Mahomes.        After all, it was a significant moment for both Mahomes and Rihanna. Performing on stage for the first time since 2018, Rihanna is also the first pregnant woman to do so. Patrick Mahomes, of course, won another title.           However, Mahomes was quick to deny: “My name is taken by my son, Patrick Lavon Mahomes III, so I don’t know if that name is still allowed.

As far as coach Andy Reid was concerned, one could either enjoy Rihanna\'s show or play the second half. ""I didn\'t, but I heard it was great. But uh, coach Reid told us, he said, \'if you go out to watch the performance just keep walking \'cause you\'re not playing the rest of the game,"" Mahomes said.  Did Rihanna\'s performance help Patrick Mahomes secure their Super Bowl win? Before halftime, the Chiefs were trailing the Philadelphia Eagles by 10 points. Rihanna\'s performance ultimately gave them the much-needed time to regroup and return with newfound energy. The team did play a much better second half, taking home the win with a 38-35 score. Apple Music Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show     Patrick Mahomes admitted that there were bad moments for the Chiefs, especially when he aggravated his ankle injury. The QB knew it would hurt, and the halftime show allowed him to work on it.

This was their fourth defeat on the trot. The Dolphins led 20-13 at the half but failed to score a single point in the second.  Many on social media pinned this loss on Tagovailoa. The quarterback started the game well but threw three interceptions on three straight drives in the second half, including one which effectively ended the game.        But there might be a very strong reason for Tagavailoa's performance.

"", ""3 observations from Tua Tagovailoa's big day against the Atlanta Falcons  Tua Tagovailoa has started to look more comfortable in the Miami Dolphins offense during the preseason. The Dolphins bounced back after their Week 1 loss to the Chicago Bears with a dominant performance against the Atlanta Falcons. All three of the quarterbacks that played for the Dolphins threw touchdown passes.  Jacoby Brissett completed all eight of his passes that he threw for 99 yards and a touchdown. Reid Sinnett completed the two passes he threw for seven yards and a touchdown. However, the talk of the game was Dolphins' second-year quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.        Here are three observations from Tua Tagovailoa's massive performance against the Atlanta Falcons.              Miami Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa looked terrific during the Week 2 win #1 Tua Tagovailoa's performance should ease the trade talks The Miami Dolphins are one of the few teams that are still interested in trading for Deshaun Watson. That trade package would most likely include their second-year quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Watson is an exceptional talent, but Tua proved he has what it takes in their second preseason game.     Rocket.@Tua | #ATLvsMIA pic.twitter.com/F6Mh7n3TFJ— NFL (@NFL) August 22, 2021 Justin Fields' debut looked over Tua's Week 1 performance against the Chicago Bears. Tagovailoa completed eight of his eleven passes for 99 yards and an interception. The former Alabama quarterback demolished his Week 1 performance against the Falcons on Saturday. The Miami Dolphins gave Tua Tagovailoa a good amount of reps during their second preseason game. Tua completed sixteen of his twenty-three passes for 183 yards and a touchdown. The Dolphins quarterback may have done enough to silence the trade talks for a couple of months.      #2 Tua Tagovailoa still has more to prove, even with his excellent performance Even though Tua Tagovailoa had a big game against the Atlanta Falcons, Tagovailoa started the game completing all eight of his passes, but most of his completions were short throws. There's still more that he needs to prove. .@Tua has the @MiamiDolphins knocking on the door again. #ATLvsMIA pic.twitter.com/EcnPXgSvfj— NFL (@NFL) August 21, 2021 The Dolphins are still easing Tua into things, and unfortunately, that's limiting his potential. Tua still needs to prove that he can clean up his accuracy. He still shows some inconsistencies on short passes.     It will take more than a big game against the Falcons in the preseason for the Dolphins to be 100% sold on Tagovailoa.  #3 Tua Tagovailoa will need to lead the Dolphins to the playoffs in 2021 The Miami Dolphins have the 27th ranked strength of schedule heading into the upcoming season. Miami has added more weapons for Tua Tagovailoa to throw the football to this season. The former Alabama quarterback will enter the 2021 season in the same situation as Giants quarterback Daniel Jones.Tua Tagovailoa will have a tough road through the AFC East, especially after the improvements made by the New England Patriots and the Buffalo Bills looking good as well. Having the 27th ranked strength of schedule will make the 2021 season a playoff or bust season for Tua Tagovailoa.     "", 'NFL analyst labels Dolphins\' Tua Tagovailoa “careless” in return from concussion  Tua Tagovailoa\'s quick return from back-to-back concussions surprised many fans who saw him get injured on Thursday Night Football.   Some expected the quarterback to be jumpy in the pocket on his return, while others expected him to put up dizzying numbers. While he endured a decent return, one NFL analyst called him ""careless"" in how he handled the football.        Speaking on ""Sunday Night Football Final,"" Chris Simms claimed the Miami Dolphins star could have easily had almost half a dozen interceptions. Here\'s how he put it:           ""There were some careless decisions we saw from Tua and it was at least four to five dropped interceptions you saw there. [Cameron] Sutton drops it, [Terrell] Edmunds drops it down the middle cover to safety there. ""Here\'s a careless throw by Tua behind him, a little off target that could have been intercepted.""

Tua Tagovailoa of the Miami Dolphins In terms of completion percentage, Tua Tagovailoa\'s 60 percent mark was his second-lowest of the season. With 261 yards, his performance on Sunday Night Football ranked second-to-last in terms of yardage.        His one touchdown throw matched what he did in two other games and beat what he did against the Cincinnati Bengals when he threw for zero touchdowns. It was in that game that he suffered his infamous injury.   It was his third game of the season in which he avoided throwing an interception. While it wasn\'t his worst game of the year, Tua Tagovailoa\'s production against the Steelers was a far cry from his lone great performance.It came against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 2 when he threw for six touchdowns, two interceptions, and 469 yards.     ', '""That\'s a stronger arm than what Tua and Mac Jones got"" - NFL fans left divided over Cam Newton\'s performance at Auburn Pro Day  Cam Newton surprised the NFL world when he announced that he was going to be throwing at Auburn\'s pro day. The 33-year-old who hasn\'t played a down in the NFL since 2021 took part in several quarterback drills Tuesday.  After he went viral saying there aren\'t 32 quarterbacks better than him on Monday, Newton went to work at the pro day, and NFL fans came away from his workout with one thing stuck in their minds: He can still throw the football.        While it is fine throwing against air, when the time comes to play against other defenders, that is where the real test is for the 33-year-old. Still, one fan came away thinking that Newton\'s arm is stronger than two current NFL quarterbacks:           ""Thats a stronger arm than What Tua (Tagovailoa) and Mac Jones got.""

It remains to be seen whether the veteran quarterback will get another chance in the NFL, but he is putting his best foot forward in an attempt to get back into the league.  Could Cam Newton sign with a team in 2023? Carolina Panthers QB Cam Newton Given that Cam Newton hasn\'t played an NFL snap since 2021, teams could be hesitant to give the veteran a roster spot. Not seen as a backup quarterback in the NFL due to his charisma and energy, would a team be comfortable with having Newton as a backup?        The other point is, what would the contract offer look like? At first glance, it would likely have to be a veteran\'s minimum contract, and it\'s unclear if Cam Newton would be willing to accept that kind of deal.        The fire still burns to return to the NFL, but his record since 2019 doesn\'t make for good reading. Newton is 7-16 as a starter, which doesn\'t bode well for his chances.Will there be a market for Newton? We await with anticipation.

Tagovailoa struggles in the spotlight in Chargers loss Miami Dolphins v Los Angeles Chargers As much as the game was about Herbert\'s sensational aerial show, it was also about Tua\'s poor performance.

Receiver Tyreek Hill was again the Dolphins\' main threat as he caught four passes for 81 yards and a touchdown along with a fumble return for a touchdown. Other than that it was slim pickings for Miami. Going 3/11 on third down will do little to quell the heat bring brought on Miami\'s quarterback, and such was the domination that L.A. had 29 more plays and had the ball for 19 minutes more than the Dolphins did.

', ""NFL Week 16: Why did Tua Tagovailoa get benched?  Miami Dolphins rookie quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was benched mid-game for the second time this season during an unsteady performance against the Las Vegas Raiders.  The first time Dolphins coach Brian Flores benched Tagovailoa for performance reasons was during a Week 11 loss to the Denver Broncos. Tua was 11 for 20 for 83 yards and a touchdown before getting replaced with Ryan Fitzpatrick.         With 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter against the Raiders, the Dolphins were trailing 16-13. Flores was not satisfied with his rookie QB's play, benching Tagovailoa and replacing him with veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Miami's opening day starter -- under center.            Up to that point, Tagovailoa was 17 of 22 for 94 yards with a touchdown and no interceptions. He'd been sacked three times and rushed for 11 yards. Tagovailoa was efficient, but he could not move the ball down the field with a disappointing 4.3 yards per attempt.  The last four minutes of #MIAvsLV were CRAZY 😱 pic.twitter.com/9ctMqAO19h— NFL Network (@nflnetwork) December 27, 2020     The Dolphins' offense had three consecutive three-and-out drives as the Raiders' defense beat out the rookie-led offense. The Raiders seemed to have Miami's number.  In a desperate race for the playoffs, coach Flores decided he wouldn't take any chances. Even if they lost, they would still be in contention for the playoffs, but a win will give them a lead over the Baltimore Ravens. Benching Tagovailoa resulted in a spontaneous win for the Dolphins against the Las Vegas Raiders, kicking the Raiders out of playoff contention.  Fitzpatrick connected with wide receiver Mack Hollins on a 34-yard completion with 12 seconds left in the game.  Ryan Fitzpatrick pulls off the NFL version of the no-look pass to set up the FG. Miami pulls off a THRILLER!pic.twitter.com/O73aKgDbA3— ClutchPoints (@ClutchPointsApp) December 27, 2020     Hollins managed the play while getting his facemask wrenched, a penalty that nudged the Dolphins into field goal range.  Jason Sanders gave a 44-yard kick allowing Miami to win 26-25 ultimately. Fitzpatrick swiftly made an impact for Miami on an 84-yard drive that ended a game-tying field goal with over 4 minutes to play. He finished with a 9-for-13 for 182 yards and a 59-yard touchdown pass to running back Myles Gaskin, sealing the win with an inexplicable downfield shot with 19 seconds left to set up the winning field goal.  Fitzpatrick completed five of six passes for 73 yards, including a 31-yard pass to tight end Mike Gesicki down to the Raiders 4 yard line -- the most extended play of the game. Tua is expected to play in Week 17 against the Buffalo Bills. He has completed 65.1 percent of his pass attempts for 1,453 yards, 10 touchdowns, and two interceptions.Brian Flores on Dolphins starting QB next week: “Tua is the starter.”— Will Manso (@WillManso) December 27, 2020     "", ""NFL Pro Bowl voting: How did Dolphins’ Tua Tagovailoa miss out despite leading fan vote?

22,Justin Fields,"['5 observations on Justin Fields\' performance during the Bears\' training camp  Chicago Bears fans cannot wait for Justin Fields to get the starting quarterback spot. They genuinely believe, and with good reason, that the he is their future franchise quarterback. As he takes his place in training, here are some observations on how Justin Fields is staking his claim to the position.  Justin Fields at the Chicago Bears\' Training Camp        #1 - A serious threat with his speed           During training camp, he had to deal with the pass rush from time to time, and he used his speed to good effect. He is adept at escaping the pocket and turning possible sacks into gained yards and first downs. In a recent session, on third-and-12, he accelerated to convert it into a 13 yard gain and slid beautifully to avoid contact. For a quarterback to have a 4.4 second 40 yard dash is a serious tool in the arsenal. #2 - Still learning to curb his enthusiasm While he is undoubtedly a hot prospect in town, he is still learning a lot from veteran quarterback and likely starter in Week 1, Andy Dalton. The latter\'s presence brings serenity to the offense, which makes them more effective. While having Justin Fields can light up the play, having Dalton makes sure that there is no need to go into box-office plays in the first place.     Matt Nagy reiterates Andy Dalton will be Bears\' starter, Justin Fields ""our No. 2"" https://t.co/RuoSJQcIgg pic.twitter.com/ILLxjrtAVN— Around The NFL (@AroundTheNFL) June 15, 2021 #3 - Getting used to the speed of professional football By his own admission, Justin Fields is still getting used to the speed of the NFL. That is not a surprise given just how much of a gulf there is between college and professional football. However, hearing it from the horse\'s mouth gives an impression of a player who is aware of the challenges ahead and accordingly willing to confront them. It also shows humility on the part of a young player.     Bears QB Justin Fields: ""The speed is a lot faster in the NFL.""— Mark Grote (@markgrotesports) August 2, 2021 #4 - Capable of incredible throws Anyone who has observed Justin Fields during training camp will have seen him make spectacular deep throws with stunning accuracy. However, he has a lot more tricks up his sleeve, which he demonstrated with some outrageous throws, including a sidearm.         #5 - Has the respect of veteransAs a rookie, it is not easy to come into any dressing room and command the respect of those who have been there and done that before. However, his performances have merited that recognition from his teammates already, with Jimmy Graham comparing him to Russell Wilson.     ', ""What was Justin Fields’ 40-yard dash time? Revisiting Bears’ dual-threat QB’s pro day performance  To succeed as a quarterback in the NFL, one must possess more qualities than just arm power and precision. The role is dynamic and appears to be becoming more physically demanding with each new NFL draft class. The NFL Combine is the ideal venue to display such agility and quickness.  Anyone who saw Justin Fields compete at Ohio State during his two-year stint knew that he was a very talented player. However, Fields demonstrated just how quick he was at his pro day on campus.        SportsCenter@SportsCenterJustin Fields was MOVING  He ran 4.44u at Ohio State Pro Day.(via @NFLBrasil) 9240849Justin Fields was MOVING 💨 He ran 4.44u at Ohio State Pro Day.(via @NFLBrasil) https://t.co/NnCEJuJC4V           Before Justin Fields' Ohio State pro day in 2021, it was assumed that he would be selected among the top ten in the NFL draft. By performing pleasantly during his training, he only served himself. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Fields had an unofficial 40-yard sprint mark of 4.44 seconds, which ranked as the second-fastest speed for a quarterback in 15 years. While many scouts estimated his unofficial timing at that point, one estimated it to be 4.43 seconds. The only quarterback to beat Fields' time at the Scouting Combine since 2006, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter, was Robert Griffin III, who ran a 4.41 at the Combine in 2012.     USA TODAY NFL@usatodaynflHello, Justin Fields. 82Hello, Justin Fields. https://t.co/ws9FgPUU7D After launching his career at Georgia, Fields threw for 5,373 yards, 63 scores, and nine interceptions during his two years at Ohio State. Is Justin Fields the fastest quarterback in the league now? There are various perspectives on quarterback quickness. The 40-yard dash time is typically the default; however, not all QBs run a 40 at the Combine. Lamar Jackson did not participate in the Combine's running event, but at Louisville's Speed Day in 2017, he had a time of 4.34, making him the league's quickest active quarterback. Justin Fields tops all current quarterbacks with the fourth-fastest official Combine 40-time since 2000 after clocking a 4.44 at the 2021 NFL Combine.     NFL@NFLJustin Fields. 4.43u SPEED.

(via @movethesticks) @justnfields📺: @OhioStateFB Pro Day on @nflnetwork https://t.co/Wu1B2XACNg When Fields ran for 41 yards against the Dallas Cowboys at 21.23 mph, it was the quickest run by any quarterback in the entire 2022 season. Thanks to that run, he was the 15th-fastest carrier on any play last season.In addition, Fields became just the third quarterback in NFL history to surpass 1,000 rushing yards in a season. Before Fields, only Michael Vick and Lamar Jackson had amassed 1,000 running yards while serving as quarterbacks.Fields accomplished this feat, among other things, by making amazing runs, eluding defenders, and flying off at breakneck speed.     "", 'Colin Cowherd takes dig at Cam Newton while undermining Justin Fields’ performances - “People fell for the spectacular”  Justin Fields\' NFL career hasn\'t gone as many would have thought when he was drafted by the Chicago Bears. There are a few reasons why, but for many, Fields hasn\'t been surrounded with good enough talent.  Last season, the offensive line was decent enough, but Fields still didn\'t give fans enough hope to show he is the guy moving forward. He is just two years into his career, so maybe he needs some slack. But FS1\'s Colin Cowherd isn\'t doing so.        Cowherd thinks that the time is now for Fields to show what he can do as he has the offensive weapons around him. However, Cowherd said that many have fallen for the spectacular with Fields as his running capabilities are incredible and likened him to former running quarterback Cam Newton.           “I watched this with Cam Newton a little bit,"" Cowherd said on ""The Herd."" ""Cam was a highlight guy, a YouTube guy, but struggled on basic stuff, and it\'s easy for the fans in the media, fall for sensational and what it becomes is like a bad action movie. Two hours, three really good scenes surrounded by crap. ""Nothing against Cam, he could not complete enough passes. Never had back-to-back winning seasons, but people fell for the spectacular.”     Herd w/Colin Cowherd@TheHerdNo more excuses for Justin Fields and the Bears:""This should be a playoff team."" — @ColinCowherd25732No more excuses for Justin Fields and the Bears:""This should be a playoff team."" — @ColinCowherd https://t.co/TmiI5mFeBI What Cowherd is saying is that with Justin Fields there are a few good plays every game, and the rest isn\'t good viewing, meaning he needs to find consistency in his game. Will he finally get it this year? Time will tell.  Can Justin Fields and the Bears challenge for the NFC North? Justin Fields     Some Bears fans hope Chicago can challenge to win the NFC North, but for that to happen, Justin Fields needs to take that next step as a quarterback. In his two NFL seasons , Fields is 5-20 as a starter, has thrown 24 touchdowns to 21 interceptions and has a completion percentage of just 57.9.    Those numbers need to improve, and with D.J. Moore, Darnell Mooney, Robert Tonyan and Cole Kmet and running backs in Kahlil Herbert and D\'Onta Foreman, Justin Fields has some weapons to work with.     The defense was the worst in football for points allowed (27.2 per game), so that needs to tighten up as well.   But the main thing is for Justin Fields to improve as a quarterback and to show why he was such a high draft pick. He has shown flashes of his talent, but time has come to show some level of consistency.     ', ""Most QB rushing yards in a quarter: Justin Fields creates history vs. Lions  Justin Fields has officially arrived. Week after week, he does things many quarterbacks have not done yet or haven't done in a long time, and Week 17 is no different. He put up 105 rushing yards in a quarter, which is an incredible feat.   In fact, it's the most by a single player in the last 45 years.         Elias Sports Bureau@EliasSportsJalen Hurts' 103 first-quarter rushing yards are the most single-quarter rushing yards by a QB over the last 45 seasons. The only other QB to post 100+ in a single quarter over that span was Terrelle Pryor, who had 100 in the first quarter against Pittsburgh in 2013. @Eagles3311Jalen Hurts' 103 first-quarter rushing yards are the most single-quarter rushing yards by a QB over the last 45 seasons. The only other QB to post 100+ in a single quarter over that span was Terrelle Pryor, who had 100 in the first quarter against Pittsburgh in 2013. @Eagles https://t.co/7eFC4lOMnb           That record had been set by Jalen Hurts earlier in the season, but was just eclipsed by Fields in the first quarter against the woeful Detroit Lions.  Should this pace continue (though 400 yards rushing is nearly impossible), he'd easily break his own record for most rushing yards by a quarterback in a single game.   Top three single-quarter rushing performances by a quarterback ft. Justin Fields     While the Detroit Lions' run defense is impressively bad (just ask the Carolina Panthers), the feat Fields pulled off is incredible nonetheless. His 105 rushing yards in a quarter would be a great single game total for a quarterback.  Earlier this year, Hurts ran all over the Green Bay Packers in a 40-33 win. He started the game with 103 yards and then finished with 157 at 9.2 yards per carry. It was a dominant effort.      The third time a quarterback has done this was by Terrelle Pryor, who eclipsed the century mark in a quarter against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2013.      With this dominant effort (Fields' total is at 105 midway through the second quarter), he's inching closer and closer to Lamar Jackson's single-season record. Lamar Jackson holds the record Justin Fields is nearing In 2019, Jackson recorded 1,206 yards in an MVP-winning campaign. Fields now needs less than 100 yards in this week and next week to hold the record.     It should be noted that the initial record was set in a 16-game season and Fields is enjoying an 18-game season, but it is impressive nonetheless as Justin Fields missed one game due to injury.

Many NFL scouts must have been watching this game. Trevor Lawrence has been the talk of the NFL for quite a while. He led the Clemson Tigers to a National Championship in his freshman year, and he is viewed as the best quarterback prospect in recent memory.

', ""Bears have to do better to complement Justin Fields' recent performances and convert losses to wins  The Chicago Bears lost to the Detroit Lions again, despite Justin Fields' best efforts in Week 10. The 31-30 loss means the Lions are now 3-7 this season and in last place in the NFC North.  Both teams came into Sunday's game with an evenly-matched regular record.        The game was even for most of the first half. Both teams had field goals that left them tied for three points apiece at the end of the first quarter. In the second quarter, both teams scored a touchdown to bring the half-time score to 10-10.            Jared Goff threw a passing touchdown to Brock Wright after the Lions took a risk on 4th-and-goal. However, the Bears pulled level with a magnificent rushing touchdown by Justin Fields, which was the highlight of the half. The second half saw the Chicago Bears coming out strong. The defense stopped the Detroit Lions in their tracks. On the next drive, Fields connected for a touchdown pass to Cole Kmet. That gave them a 17-10 lead. Justin Fields also completed four consecutive games with, at least, one rushing and one passing touchdown with that pass.  When they got the ball next, the Bears extended their lead to 24-10 after a 50-yard touchdown pass from Fields to Kmet. The third quarter got even better when the Bears defense sacked Jared Goff in the last minute.     The fourth quarter saw some bad defensive plays by the Bears as they gave away penalties and failed to stop D'Andre Swift's run to the end zone to bring the game to 24-17. On the next play, disaster struck for Justin Fields as he threw an interception on 2nd-and-18. Cornerback Jeff Okudah ran into the end zone to make it 24-24.  But if Fields was at fault for that, then he more than made up for it on the next drive. On a 3rd-and-2 at their 30-yard line, he took off and ran for a 67-yard rushing touchdown. The conversion was missed, meaning the Bears were up 30-24. Billy Heyen@BillyHeyenJustin Fields 67-yard rushing touchdown 71Justin Fields 67-yard rushing touchdown 😳 https://t.co/IO3q73OTTS     The next drives stalled, but when the Lions got the ball back, they made it count by setting up a long drive down field with Jamaal Williams scoring a rushing touchdown. The conversion gave them a 31-30 lead that they never relinquished. How good has Justin Fields been over the last few weeks? Anyone who saw Justin Fields on Sunday saw a team losing despite their quarterback and not because of him. It has been a similar story for the last three weeks. His current run of, at least, one rushing and one passing touchdown in four straight games is tied for the second-longest in NFL history.  In his last three losses, his quarterback rating was 120.0 against Dallas, 106.7 against Miami and 99.4 today. He has seven passing touchdowns and four rushing touchdowns in his last three games, with the only interception coming on Sunday. Yet he has lost all three games.

Fields has also been sacked nine times in the last three games, pointing to a need for the offensive line to toughen up and the wide receivers to get open faster. Fields has been nothing but exemplary in recent weeks, but he is not getting much support. The Bears will have to do better, and soon.     "", '\'Justin Fields is so special\': LeBron James showers praise on Bears QB after a fantastic NFL debut  NBA superstar LeBron James was thoroughly impressed by rookie Justin Fields\' stellar performance in his NFL preseason debut in the Chicago Bears\' 20-13 victory over the Miami Dolphins.  The four-time NBA champion called Fields ""special"" on Twitter.        Justin Fields is so SPECIAL man!! Keep going Young 👑— LeBron James (@KingJames) August 14, 2021           Justin Fields shines on debut Incumbent starter Andy Dalton started the game for the Bears and played the opening quarter before being replaced by Fields for the second and third. The rookie quarterback had a rough start, going three-and-out in his opening three drives. He almost threw an interception during the third and then fumbled the ball only to recover it himself. On his fourth and final drive of the quarter, the rookie led the offense down the field to set up a field-goal attempt that helped the Bears get on the scoreboard.     Fields looked much more composed on the opening drive of the third quarter, making some assured throws before rushing for an eight-yard touchdown. The rookie quarterback was more comfortable as the game went on and started showcasing just why the Bears traded up during the 2021 NFL draft to acquire him. On his penultimate drive, he marched down the field with the offense and threw a 30-yard touchdown pass to put the Bears in the lead. Fields exited the game after going three-and-out on the Bears\' final drive of the third quarter. Fields completed 14 of his 20 pass attempts for 142 yards and rushed for 33 yards in five attempts. He was responsible for both of the Bears\' touchdowns in the game. While head coach Matt Nagy has named Andy Dalton as the team\'s starter for the Bears\' Week 1 match against the Los Angeles Rams, Fields\' performance will ensure that he revisits that decision.

', ""NFL preseason: 3 strengths and weaknesses from Justin Fields' rookie debut against the Dolphins  Chicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields made his NFL debut against the Miami Dolphins on Saturday. The rookie quarterback came in after the second drive and didn't come out until the third quarter.  After struggling in his first few drives, Fields showcased his immense talent as a passer and a runner and helped the Bears beat the Dolphins.        While there were plenty of positives, there were also a few negatives about Fields' performance. Let's look at them in more detail.            What are the strengths of Justin Fields' NFL debut? Chicago Bears QB Justin Fields #1 - Fields showed tremendous patience in the pocket Fields hung in and waited in the pocket for plays to develop rather than make any rash decisions, as is the norm with rookie quarterbacks. He took his time to go through his reads before taking off and running. He showed excellent pocket presence and avoided the rush. The Bears should be pleased with Fields' poise in the pocket.     .@justnfields uses his legs to score his first #NFLPreseason touchdown! 🙌📺: #MIAvsCHI on @NFLNetwork (or check local listings)📱: https://t.co/VJzItUyljP pic.twitter.com/TXCVxj1xFl— NFL (@NFL) August 14, 2021 #2 - Fields showed off his running ability If there's one thing that impressed the Bears most about Justin Fields, it's his ability to run with the ball. The rookie quarterback ran for 33 yards in five rushing attempts, including an eight-yard run for his first NFL touchdown. #3 Justin Fields took care of the football Fields connected on 14 of his 20 pass attempts for 142 yards and a touchdown. But the most crucial stat is that he didn't toss any interceptions.     Justin Fields is so SPECIAL man!! Keep going Young 👑— LeBron James (@KingJames) August 14, 2021 Fields took care of the football and made intelligent decisions. Not only did he not throw an interception, but the rookie also didn't take a single sack. The Chicago Bears offensive line did a good job protecting Fields for most of the game, but when the Dolphins' pass rush got through, the rookie made the right reads to avoid getting sacked.  What are the weaknesses of Justin Fields' NFL Debut?     Chicago Bears QB Justin Fields #1 Fields got off to a slow start The rookie quarterback did get off to a slow start against the Miami Dolphins on Saturday. Chicago went three-and-out on the first three drives with Fields under center. They also committed two false start penalties, but this is common among rookie quarterbacks. #2 Justin Fields needs to protect the football while running Fields is undoubtedly a threat when he is running with the football. But he needs to learn to protect the ball instead of forcing a play to gain an extra couple of yards.      In one instance against the Dolphins, the pocked collapsed and Fields rolled out to his left to make a play. But one of the defenders popped the ball loose because it wasn't tucked. Fields managed to recover the ball, but it should teach him that he has to make sure the ball is always secured. #3 - Needs more work in 2-minute offense Justin Fields got his shot at the end of the first half to run a two-minute drill. At first, he tried to force plays and also fumbled the ball only to recover it himself. But then he showed great poise, corrected his mistakes and led the Bears down the field for a field goal to end the half.  Final thoughts on Justin Fields' NFL debut Overall, Justin Fields had a successful NFL debut. He showed that he's capable of fixing his mistakes on the go. Some could say that the rookie surpassed the expectations.His ability to control and command the offense is something that the Chicago Bears need. It'll be interesting to see how Chicago plays out the rest of the preseason with Fields.     "", 'Justin Fields\' rookie season stats have left Bears unimpressed, reveals insider  Rookie Chicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields has had a tough time in his first season as an NFL quarterback. Fields and the Bears have a 2-8 record, and Fields\' stats have been rather underwhelming: he has thrown for seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions.  The Chicago Tribune\'s Brad Biggs, the Bears\' insider, was asked about Fields\' poor performances this season by a fan in his weekly question-and-answer column. Although it is only his rookie year, Biggs stated that Fields\' performances have been bad and that Mitch Trubisky\'s rookie season was statistically better with fewer players around him than what Fields now has.        “The performance to this point hasn’t been good,” Biggs wrote.           ""He has a lot of work to do,"" Biggs continued, ""and I think he’ll be driven to show he can turn the corner going into Year 2. But it’s about as bad as it can be right now. … Mitch Trubisky’s rookie season in 2017 with a lower-caliber cast of skill position players around him was statistically better.”  Justin Fields\' tough rookie season Minnesota Vikings v Chicago Bears      Also read: Watch: \'Fire Nagy\' chants once again echo around Soldier Field after disappointing loss to Vikings In true rookie fashion, Fields has struggled mightily in spots this season.

Other rookies, such as Mac Jones (69) and Davis Mills (65.6), have better completion percentage and more touchdown passes than Fields.     Fields has thrown an interception in every game, bar five.

Against the Browns, he was taken down nine times. He has been sacked four times on three occasions, and there have been six instances of him getting sacked twice or more.

His physical attributes with his athletic plays are what keep him out of harm\'s way in some instances, but such moments are few and far between.It is hoped that Fields will use his harsh learning experience in his first season as a building block to get better, have an improved second season and show the NFL community that he is the Bears\' future.Also read: WATCH: NFL fans FRUSTRATED with refs over horrible Eric Kendricks ejection during Vikings vs Bears     ']"
23,Nick Mullens,"[""Kirk Cousins: NFL fans roast Kirk Cousins after Vikings' brutal 40-3 loss to Cowboys  By the time their game against the Dallas Cowboys was over, Kirk Cousins and the Minnesota Vikings had come crashing down to earth. They entered the game with an 8-1 record, fighting for the top seed in the NFC with the Philadelphia Eagles, who had an identical win-loss ratio.   They had defeated the much-fancied Buffalo Bills the previous week and there was talk about the Vikings quarterback leading them all the way to the Super Bowl.        As it turned out, they slipped back in relation to the Eagles as they lost and Philadelphia beat the Indianapolis Colts. The Vikings fell to 8-2, while the Eagles are now 9-1.            But more than the ground they lost in that race, it was the chastening nature of the defeat that should worry Vikings fans the most. Losing 40-3 to the Cowboys, they had a bad day all over the field. On defense, they gave up 40 points, which is never easy for an offense to counter. The offense, led by Kirk Cousins, had an awful day as they could not score a single touchdown. If it wasn't for Dalvin Cook, who had 11 rushing attempts for 72 yards, they would not have had a sniff of scoring even a single point.  Cousins was pressured throughout the game and gave up seven sacks for a loss of 49 yards. It was such a bad performance that by the end of the game, he was pulled and backup Nick Mullens took over quarterback duties.     NFL fans were equally less forgiving toward the Vikings quarterback. They roasted his performance across the Twitterverse.

The cornerback, however, was one of the loudest players on the team during the brutal beatdown of the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday. During a locker room interview, the cornerback called out Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless over comments they made about him:  ""And tell Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless, they need to, you know, watch what they say when they talk about me.

', ""3 potential trade candidates for the Dallas Cowboys before the 2021 training camp  Free agency is largely wrapped up for the Dallas Cowboys. With draft business tidied up, the Cowboys will now head to training camp as they prep for the season.  While the Cowboys look like a decent outfit heading into pre-season, are there any holes to plug before they kick off Week 1?        Looking at the Cowboys' roster, the most glaring hole appears to be at backup quarterback. Garrett Gilbert has put in some interesting performances in the AAF, but the Cowboys need an NFL-caliber quarterback. Here are some options Jerry Jones and co could possibly explore before the start of the season.           Potential upgrades for the Dallas Cowboys #1 - Nick Mullens (Philadelphia Eagles) Nick Mullens is currently battling Joe Flacco to be the backup to Jalen Hurts. ESPN has Nick Mullens as the obvious third-string backup. However, most NFL teams only keep two quarterbacks on the roster. If the Philadelphia Eagles are already determined to go with Joe Flacco, Nick Mullens becomes the odd man out. Rather than cutting him outright, the Philadelphia Eagles could try and get something for him. That's where the Dallas Cowboys come in. Roster Move: #Eagles have agreed to terms with QB Nick Mullens. pic.twitter.com/HdaxAs3kEx— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) June 14, 2021     Nick Mullens is good to have around a 1:1 touchdown interception ratio, but his biggest plus point is that he is still pretty young in the NFL. He has only played in two seasons and could have more tricks up his sleeve given time and a stable atmosphere. #2 - Joe Flacco (Philadelphia Eagles) If the Philadelphia Eagles decide they want Nick Mullens over Joe Flacco, the latter becomes expendable. Flacco could be more expensive for the Dallas Cowboys to trade for, but if Dak Prescott gets injured again, Flacco would be a better option than Mullens. The Dallas Cowboys should be watching the position battle between Mullen and Flacco very closely.         It doesn't matter who wins, as both odd-man-out scenarios would result in more stability at backup quarterback in Dallas. If the Dallas Cowboys land Joe Flacco, they may be able to get him to heat up in the playoffs if the need arises. Flacco has a Super Bowl ring and, given the right circumstances, could rediscover his old self. #3 - Taylor Heinicke (Washington Football Team) If the Philadelphia Eagles are unwilling to do business with a division rival, the Dallas Cowboys could look towards the Washington Football Team. Washington will start Ryan Fitzpatrick at QB. Below him in the pecking order will be one of Kyle Allen or Taylor Heinicke. If Heinicke slips to No 3, the Dallas Cowboys will rest easy. Taylor Heinicke     Taylor Heinicke stepped into an impossible situation in 2020. Starting quarterback Alex Smith suffered his final football injury, leaving Heinicke to start his second game of the season in the Wild Card round of the NFL playoffs. With Tom Brady at the other end, many expected Washington to suffer the ignominy of a humbling. However, fans were treated to a solid game that was a lot closer than it needed to be. Taylor Heinicke threw the ball 44 times and put up 23 points in a 31-23 loss to the team that went on to win the Super Bowl. Taylor Heinicke's team did a much better job of standing up to the Buccaneers than the Kansas City Chiefs, who lost their matchup 31-9.Having put in a remarkable effort, Heinicke could be the man for the Dallas Cowboys.

Philadelphia trades for Jacksonville QB Gardner Minshew  The Philadelphia Eagles may have made a very underrated roster move by acquiring QB Garnder Minshew from the Jacksonville Jaguars, adding to a roster with Jalen Hurts and Joe Flacco already in place. Gardner Minshew lost a QB ""battle"" that he was never seriously going to win against the number one overall pick Trevor Lawrence. Minshew was a breakout star in 2019 when he took over for Nick Foles. In 2020, he struggled on the field with a lingering hand injury that impacted his performance. The Jaguars drafted Lawrence, a generational talent, and it was just a matter of time before they traded Gardner Minshew as he wasn\'t going to unseat Trevor Lawrence any time soon.  Trade: #Eagles have acquired QB Gardner Minshew from Jacksonville in exchange for a conditional sixth-round pick in 2022. The team also released QB Nick Mullens. pic.twitter.com/MLYrJfymxE— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) August 28, 2021        Gardner Minshew trade shows uncertainty with Jalen Hurts...and Jacksonville Jaguars head coach?           Enter the Philadelphia Eagles, who have been in deep thought on what Jalen Hurts\' future holds with the team. Through three NFL preseason games, Jalen Hurts saw action only in Week 1 as the starter (3/7 for 54 yards). QB Joe Flacco played most of the preseason and played well, too. Philadelphia seems to be hinting to Jalen Hurts that his time as a starter could be in jeopardy by offering a sixth-round pick for Gardner Minshew. So yes, the Philadelphia Eagles are still not sold on Jalen Hurts being the face of their franchise. That doesn\'t mean he\'ll be benched immediately for Flacco or Minshew, who is #3 on the depth chart. The team does have options at QB now though, if injury, COVID-19, or regression strikes Jalen Hurts. Flacco had a great preseason and showed he can still perform with success in the NFL, but he\'s not suited to lead Nick Sirianni\'s offense. It requires a smaller, more mobile and athletic player and that has never been Joe Flacco. Gardner Minshew, on the other hand, looks like a prime candidate for such a system. The Eagles do not know if he\'ll be more like the 2019 or 2020 Gardner Minshew, though. It would be smart not to give Minshew responsibilities on the offense before he earns them.     Eagles just landed a 25-year old QB that has completed 62.9% with 37 TD, only 11 INT, and 93.1% rating in his first two seasons for a stinking 6th round pick. Gardner Minshew is a winning NFL quarterback. Absolute no-brainer deal for Howie Roseman.— Jim Nagy (@JimNagy_SB) August 28, 2021 Jacksonville dropped the ball with Gardner Minshew Giving up a sixth-round pick for a QB with 5,530 passing yards and 37 passing TDs in two years is a steal and says more about the dysfunction and uncertainty in Jacksonville than Philadelphia. The so-called QB competition seemed like an act to boost Minshew\'s trade value, which failed obviously and leaves HC Urban Meyer to be criticized for such a move. Still, Philadelphia does well to have extra options at QB, something they\'ve been known to do over the years.     Despite playing 13 less full games, Jalen Hurts had more 300+ passing yard performances than Baker Mayfield.In Hurts’ 3 game stretch of full starts, he also averaged more YPG, TD per game, and had a higher Comp %.#Eagles pic.twitter.com/mpF8OkEpb4— Eagles Nation (@PHLEaglesNation) August 23, 2021 Jalen Hurts has potential, but needs to utilize it early in 2021 Jalen Hurts is still just 23 with only four career starts, even though it may feel he\'s played more than that. A 1-3 record isn\'t great and neither is a 52% completion rate, 6 TDs, and four INTs. The upside is that he\'s shown he can lead, the offense respects him, and he\'s had 300+ yards in two of his four starts. He\'s played much better in training camp, but he really needed the reps in the preseason regardless of the Eagles wanting to rest him to prevent an injury. Jalen Hurts\' small amount of playing time in his career isn\'t large enough to really allow him to have a long leash as a starter and he will be under the microscope. While Gardner Minshew\'s arrival isn\'t a formal answer to Jalen Hurts losing his starting job, it does prove the Eagles feel they need to have suitable options on the depth chart.

The 26-year-old started 16 games for the Niners across the 2018 and 2020 regular seasons. He is 5-11 as a starter, throwing for 25 touchdowns with 22 interceptions and averaging 249 passing yards per game. Mullens has a career total QBR of 87.2 and would give the Packers a solid starting option if Rodgers was to be traded away. #2 - Brett Hundley Green Bay Packers v Washington Redskins Former backup quarterback Brett Hundley is another option for the Packers.     Hundley was drafted by the Packers in the fifth round of the 2015 NFL draft. He was the backup to Aaron Rodgers from 2015-17. After Rodgers broke his collarbone in 2017, Hundley started nine games for Green Bay. He threw for 1,836 yards and nine touchdowns with 12 interceptions, while also rushing for 270 yards and two touchdowns. The fact he has previous experience with Green Bay makes him an obvious free-agent target for the franchise.

RG3 has thrown 42 touchdowns with 30 interceptions in his NFL career.Now an eight-season NFL veteran, Griffin could be the perfect mentor for Packers rookie QB Jordan Love if Rodgers is traded. He also brings a different style of play compared to Rodgers.     ', '""Raise your sons to be VICTORS like Tim Tebow, not VICTIMS like Colin Kaepernick"" - Trump endorsed writer continues bizarre tirade against former 49ers QB  After over half a decade away from the game, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick could finally find himself on an NFL roster in 2022.  The Las Vegas Raiders brought in Kaepernick for a workout, and the veteran quarterback reportedly performed well. Per ESPN\'s Jeremy Fowler, he impressed the Raiders coaching staff with his arm strength and conditioning, but the team wasn\'t in a hurry to sign the quarterback and end his hiatus from the NFL.        Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterAlmost two years ago, Raiders’ owner Mark Davis endorsed the addition of Colin Kaepernick, as @PGutierrezESPN noted. Now the Raiders themselves are taking a look.2725294Almost two years ago, Raiders’ owner Mark Davis endorsed the addition of Colin Kaepernick, as @PGutierrezESPN noted. Now the Raiders themselves are taking a look. https://t.co/xBWA7aJbsM           The Raiders\' quarterback room outside of Derek Carr isn\'t too impressive. Head coach Josh McDaniels brought in former New England Patriots quarterback Jarrett Stidham, and Las Vegas also signed former 49ers signal-caller Nick Mullens to fight for the QB2 spot. Kaepernick will fancy his chances of beating them both out for the role, but even if he doesn\'t get signed by the Raiders, his performance during the workout will undoubtedly prompt other quarterback-needy teams to give the former 49ers star a chance to impress.     While many are hoping that Kaepernick finds a team to play for in 2022, few are vehemently against the idea of the quarterback returning to the NFL. Nick Adams not too keen on seeing Kaepernick back in the NFL Australian-born author Nick Adams, whose book Green Card Warrior was endorsed by former US President Donald Trump in 2017, has been a noted critic of Kaepernick. In light of reports that the quarterback performed well during his workout, Adams tweeted: ""Raise your sons to be VICTORS like Tim Tebow, not VICTIMS like Colin Kaepernick."" Nick Adams@NickAdamsinUSARaise your sons to be VICTORS like Tim Tebow, not VICTIMS like Colin Kaepernick.3374645Raise your sons to be VICTORS like Tim Tebow, not VICTIMS like Colin Kaepernick.

Adams is seemingly upset about Kaepernick\'s protests during NFL games in 2016. The quarterback knelt during the national anthem to bring attention to racial inequality and police brutality. Nick Adams\' history of attacking Kaepernick Over the years, Adams has posted several tweets criticizing the former 49ers star. The author is also upset about the media ""fawning"" over Kaepernick and ignoring former Denver Broncos and New England Patriots quarterback Tim Tebow. In a tweet, he wrote:     ""It\'s disgusting how the media fawns over Colin Kaepernick while ignoring Tim Tebow."" Nick Adams@NickAdamsinUSAIt\'s disgusting how the media fawns over Colin Kaepernick while ignoring Tim Tebow.1135147It\'s disgusting how the media fawns over Colin Kaepernick while ignoring Tim Tebow. Tebow, who tried to mark a comeback to the NFL as a tight end in 2021 after a six-year absence, signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars in the offseason but was released soon after OTAs. Adams has vouched for Tebow while berating Kaepernick for several months. In another tweet, he wrote: ""I don’t know what’s more ridiculous, claims that Colin Kaepernick CAN still play in the NFL or claims that Tim Tebow CAN’T play anymore.""

', '3 reasons why the Philadelphia Eagles got the best of the Gardner Minshew trade  The first big trade in quite a while has given Gardner Minshew a new home. The quarterback is now a member of the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for a conditional sixth-round pick. Here\'s how Philadelphia won in the acquisition of ""Mustache Minshew.""  Why the Philadelphia Eagles are happy with the Gardner Minshew trade        #1 - Amazing price           Generally speaking, a sixth-round pick for a player who was a starter a season ago is a great price. Sixth-round picks rarely turn into lasting talent, but it doesn\'t get much better than spending one to take a shot on a quarterback. By only spending a sixth-round pick, the Eagles have the luxury of not putting too much pressure on themselves to keep Minshew around longer than needed. Trade: #Eagles have acquired QB Gardner Minshew from Jacksonville in exchange for a conditional sixth-round pick in 2022. The team also released QB Nick Mullens. pic.twitter.com/MLYrJfymxE— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) August 28, 2021 As soon as they feel he isn\'t a solution, he can be cut without a second thought with minimal guilt. Basically, late-round draft picks are gambles. However, teams do not have to wait until the NFL Draft to gamble with them. That is essentially what the Eagles did here.     #2 - High upside Gardner Minshew may have had a rough season last year, contributing to the Jaguars\' inadvertent efforts for the number one overall pick, but he\'s still young and has shown flashes at times. With the right development, Minshew could grow into something interesting. The Eagles are starting with him at the bottom so they can have him if he grows to be something better.     Of course, Minshew is likely years away from successfully rebounding, but the future always comes around. In three years, Minshew could be useful for the Eagles.     #3 - Flacco can mentor Hurts and Minshew Joe Flacco is the backup quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles. After his Week Three performance that saw him complete 13 of 16 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, it is hard to imagine him going anywhere. However, with two young quarterbacks on the team, Flacco can act as a mentor for both quarterbacks. Of course, Flacco will likely be more focused on Hurts, but Minshew could use anything Flacco can give him. It would be an upgrade over the lack of a mentor Minshew had to suffer through in Jacksonville. Super Bowl XLVII - Baltimore Ravens v San Francisco 49ersFlacco has won a Super Bowl and can teach Minshew a lot as he\'s been in the league for more than a decade. His advice could be instrumental in helping Minshew rebound. Unsure about a trade offer?

At the beginning of the season, the the Cardinals defeated the 49ers 24-20. The dynamic duo of Kyler Murray and DeAndre Hopkins helped Arizona defeat the defending NFC Champions. Hopkins caught 14 passes and racked up 151 receiving yards.         Since this game, this season has put both teams through the wringer. Still, the Cardinals have weathered the storm fairly well. At 8-6, they're still alive in the playoff race. On the other hand, at 5-9, the 49ers have been eliminated from playoff contention. They have lost six of their last seven games, and they're currently on a three-game losing streak.           The Cardinals' win against the Philadelphia Eagles last week gave them a boost in this tough final stretch. They're clinging onto the final seed in the NFL playoff bracket, and Arizona needs to win this game to retain that spot. Murray is coming off one of his best games of the season. He threw for 406 yards and three touchdowns last Sunday. Cardinals fans are probably hoping that this electric star will have another remarkable game on Saturday.

The 49ers' crushing 41-33 defeat last week ended their chance to make the playoffs this year. San Francisco's inability to hold onto the ball was the leading cause of this loss.

This performance was a silver lining in the loss, as it marked the team's most productive output on the ground since Week 7.      Injuries have defined this season for San Francisco. The team's injured list is one of the longest in the league. The 49ers will be playing without starting quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, backup quarterback Nick Mullens, and running back Raheem Mostert. San Francisco's depleted offense could struggle to keep up with Arizona's high-scoring unit led by Murray. If the 49ers win, they'll put a dent in the Cardinals' odds of making the postseason. The Chicago Bears have the tiebreaker over Arizona, and Chicago has a game against the 1-13 Jacksonville Jaguars this week.

Kaepernick last played in 2016, where he finished the season 1-10 as the starting quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers.  Kaepernick finished his career throwing 72 touchdowns to 30 interceptions, adding 2,300 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns.        CBS reporter Jonathan Jones spoke about Kaepernick getting a chance with the Raiders. Jones thinks the quarterback will prove his worth:           ""I think the Raiders are number one looking out for themselves. They\'re trying to make themselves be the best possible team and the most competitive division in football that AFC lesson. So if they can strengthen the backup quarterback position, there\'s no question about it. Derek Carr should not be afraid for his job right now.

They had Garrett Gilbert... You have a new head coach and Josh McDaniels, the new general manager, and Dave Ziegler. They\'re going to try to be competitive at every single position. And so if the Raiders are hoping to give Colin Kaepernick a little bit of a leg up to help him out with some of the other organizations, perhaps that\'s another piece of this, but you know, this isn\'t charity.""        The workout marked the first time since 2017 that Kaepernick met with/worked out for a team. He tried out with the Seattle Seahawks in 2017 but was ultimately never signed.        The Raiders\' current quarterback room consists of Derek Carr, Nick Mullens, Jarrett Stidham, and Chase Garbers.

The Cleveland Browns quarterback was responsible for four interceptions. Those interceptions proved to be the difference-maker in the Browns\' loss. The Green Bay Packers used the four takeaways to emerge 24-22 winners.  Mayfield\'s performance struck a nerve with Browns fans. The 2018 number one pick has been treading thin ice. In primetime, the Browns had a lot of pressure to win. Unfortunately for them, Mayfield cost his team a chance to succeed.

', 'Report reveals Browns player was unhappy with Baker Mayfield\'s poor performance in training  Baker Mayfield is currently facing a battle for his NFL future, which lies in limbo. He remains on the Cleveland Browns\' roster despite the franchise making it abundantly clear they will be moving forward with Deshaun Watson as their starting quarterback.  A recent report has questioned Mayfield\'s ability and that he was regularly poor in practice, according to an unnamed Browns player. The information contained a quote from a Browns player. The statement addresses a video Odell Beckham Jr.\'s father released on social media in November last year, showing the quarterback not throwing the ball to his son, who was open on several occasions.                View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post           According to the report, when asked if he had seen the video posted by Beckham Jr.\'s father, the unnamed Browns player gave a scathing response. He said: ""Why would I watch the video? I see it every day in practice."" Offseason Chopz@Pchopz_Oh boy.3417478Oh boy. https://t.co/edYCPG2S1j     This is another negative view that could hinder Mayfield\'s search for a new team. With the NFL Draft ending, the chance for the Browns to move him on to pastures new and focus on the future with a different quarterback have also diminished. The Carolina Panthers were interested in Mayfield, but recent reports have shown that they were never close to a deal with the Browns. The Panthers went on to draft Matt Corral, who will challenge Sam Darnold for the starting job in Charlotte.        Other potential teams that needed a quarterback have made moves to find the piece to the puzzle, with the Pittsburgh Steelers drafting Kenny Pickett and the Seattle Seahawks set to move forward with Drew Lock behind center. Seattle head coach Pete Carroll recently stated that the Seahawks weren\'t looking to add another quarterback \'at all\' to their roster, which puts an end to Seattle being a possible destination for Mayfield.  Why are teams reluctant to make a trade for Baker Mayfield? One of the main hurdles is the quarterback\'s $19 million salary due in 2022. Teams seem reluctant to take on that amount, which reportedly led to the Panthers\' and Browns\' inability to agree on trade terms.   It also seems highly unlikely that Mayfield will stay and offer back-up for Watson as he sees himself as the starting quarterback. Based on the NFL Index quarterback rankings, he ranked 25th out of 62 quarterbacks, with his inconsistency proving to be a significant shortcoming.

Mayfield is clearly frustrated with his injuries and the production of the Browns offense as well as the fact that he hasn\'t been given a contract extension as of yet. The fan boos couldn\'t help the situation and then when Mayfield declined to speak to the media, it made the entire situation even worse.After talking to the media on Monday morning, it seems that Mayfield is ready to move on, and up next is a trip to Baltimore to face the Ravens for the first time this season.     ', ""NFL Fantasy: LA Rams' QB update: Is Baker Mayfield starting tonight vs. Broncos?  Baker Mayfield looks like he is enjoying playing football for the first time in a mighty long time. The Los Angeles Rams quarterback has had a bright start to his time with the reigning Super Bowl champions, injecting some fire into an increasingly stagnant offense.  Astonishingly, this is the former number-one draft pick's third team of the 2022 season, but that's the NFL for you. Mayfield will be looking to close out the season with a flourish, as he will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the campaign.        Baker Mayfield will start tonight against the Denver Broncos in a battle featuring two of the biggest disappointments of the season. On one side are the defending Super Bowl champions, the Los Angeles Rams, who have already been eliminated from playoff contention following a Week 15 loss. Then there's the Denver Broncos, where Russell Wilson has been cooking but is yet to serve up a feast.           Mayfield is likely to start the remaining games of the season for the Rams as he seeks to rebuild his reputation before his contract expires.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Baker Mayfield fantasy outlook Baker Mayfield's 2022 season has been one of the most colorful in recent league history. He started the year as the wantaway backup following Deshaun Watson's arrival at the Cleveland Browns. Mayfield expressed his displeasure and was eventually traded to the Carolina Panthers for a low draft pick. That gave Mayfield a new lease of life, as he would be the Panthers' undisputed starting QB. However, his performances were disappointing, and he was benched after a mere seven games. After being benched for a second time, Baker Mayfield requested his release, which the Panthers granted. The LA Rams promptly picked him up and here we are. In his second game as a Ram, Mayfield failed to put up a similar performance to his debut game against the Las Vegas Raiders. He could not get much of anything going and experienced five sacks. Mayfield will face a dicey test against a resilient Denver defense, who have been the only positive in the Broncos' season.     Mayfield is not expected to shine in what is likely to be a low-scoring affair. He will probably get a passing touchdown (hopefully two) and around 200 yards through the air. This isn't exactly dynamite in fantasy terms, so start him at your own risk. There's always the chance of a Christmas miracle, but it is not being anticipated by many around the league. Mayfield's 12.17 projection (PPR Leagues) tells the whole story.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post How is Baker Mayfield performing this season?     Baker Mayfield is having a very up-and-down 2022 season. The Oklahoma State University alum has the talent, but we need to put our finger on what makes him so hesitant to take the game by the scruff of its neck. The next few games will be very important for Mayfield's NFL career, and we are sure his team knows just that.Mayfield has recorded 1,654 passing yards, eight touchdowns, and seven interceptions in nine games played this season.

With 3:03 left in the fourth quarter, the Buccaneers trailed 16-3. However, Brady engineered two game-winning drives in the final three minutes to help Tampa pull off an incredible upset win over the Saints. Mayfield\'s heroics were a replica of Brady\'s from Monday night, however, the Rams quarterback\'s performance was probably better as he had only one practice session with the team and only two days to learn the playbook. Baker Mayfield did not start the game. Backup quarterback John Wolford was under center for the Rams\' first drive of the night before the newcomer took over in the second. Replacing Wolford with Mayfield was a masterstroke for Sean McVay and the Rams\' coaching staff, as he helped them avoid slipping to 3-10.

The likelihood, however, is that Mayfield will be at another franchise, although who that will be is anyone\'s guess.If he continues winning games, his future as a starter will at least be assured.     ', ""Why Did Baker Mayfield Leave Cleveland?  Baker Mayfield entered the NFL as one of the most promising quarterbacks. The Cleveland Browns drafted him as the first overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft. He had an outstanding first three seasons with the team, and it seemed he would remain in Cleveland for a longer time.  He won six games each in his first two years, but ended up with two consecutive losing seasons. In 2020, things changed for Mayfield, when he started in all 16 games and ended the season with a 11-5 record. That year, he threw for 3,563 yards with 26 passing touchdowns, eight interceptions, and a pass completion percentage of 62.8.                     He helped the Browns reach the divisional round by beating the Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs. The Browns suffered a 17-22 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round, but overall the team gained respect for their outstanding performance that season. During the 2021 offseason, everyone was expecting a contract extension for Baker Mayfield. But after a terrible 2021 season, he ended up being traded to the Carolina Panthers.  Why did the Cleveland Browns trade Baker Mayfield to the Panthers?     Carolina Panthers v Baltimore Ravens In 2021, the Browns entered the league as one of the top contenders in the NFL, with Baker Mayfield as their starting quarterback. They wanted to capture the top position in the AFC North, but ended up being third in their division. The team started the season with a 29-33 loss to the Chiefs. It was a close game, and the expectations followed the Browns into their week 2 game. In Week 2, Mayfield sustained a torn labrum in his left shoulder while attempting a tackle on an interception. He kept playing with an injured shoulder until it worsened during the Week 6 game against the Arizona Cardinals and missed the next game against the Broncos, returning to the field in week 8.     In Week 10, he had a knee injury, but that did not keep him away from playing in the next game against the Lions. He missed only two more games, one in week 15 because of the Covid-19 protocol and in the final game of the season against the Bengals as he underwent shoulder surgery. Baker Mayfield was held responsible for Odell Beckham's Jr.'s poor performance in the 2021 season Buffalo Bills v Cleveland Browns     November 2 was the trade deadline for the 2021 season, and on the same day Beckham's father posted a video on Instagram showing the QB missing his son on passes and blaming Mayfield for the OBJ's down year. Tensions grew in the locker room and three days later, Beckham was traded to the Los Angeles Rams.    Beckham's performance in the second half of the season was outstanding as he helped the Rams lift the Lombardi trophy. This raised some questions about Mayfield's ability as a good quarterback.     As the season was about to end, there were reports of tensions between Brown's head coach Kevin Stefanski and Baker Mayfield, who was also frustrated over the lack of extension talks from the team despite the team picking up his fifth-year option for the 2022 season. The Browns traded star QB Deshaun Watson from the Houston Texans after a grand jury cleared him of his acquisitions. They made it clear that Watson will be their new starting quarterback. Finally, before practice camp started, Baker Mayfield was traded to the Carolina Panthers. You might also like - What is Jim Harbaugh's record against Ohio State? Is Baker Mayfield playing for Carolina Panthers in 2022? Las Vegas Raiders v Los Angeles Rams     Baker Mayfield started the season with the Carolina Panthers, but less than six months after acquiring him in a trade, the franchise released him. The decision came after the Panthers' poor performance in the league. The Panthers also fired their head coach, Matt Rhule, for the same reason.   The Los Angeles Rams claimed Mayfield after his release from the Panthers. He played for them this week and led them to a comeback win against the Las Vegas Raiders.     "", 'Analyst thinks Panthers are a playoff team with Baker Mayfield  Baker Mayfield\'s time with the Cleveland Browns has come to an end following his trade to the Carolina Panthers. Panthers fans are excited to see what the new season and their new quarterback will bring. The trade appears to have got some analysts a little giddy too.  One has gone as far as to suggest that Mayfield\'s arrival has turned Carolina into a playoff contender. Former NFL quarterback and ESPN analyst Dan Orlovsky was speaking on First Take and had the following to share:        ""This is why I think this is a playoff team with Baker Mayfield the guy we saw two years ago, cause that\'s the last time he was healthy, he was third in the NFL in QBR, and led them to the playoffs.""           Orlovsky continued: ""Number one, this is a top ten defense in the NFL with the Carolina Panthers, has one of the better young defensive lines in the league with Brian Burns and Derrick Brown. They also get Jaycee Horn back who was their superstar corner, first-round draft pick from the South Carolina, they\'ll get him back healthy. So this is going to be a very good defense."" The former Detroit Lions quarterback then discussed the Panthers offensive line:     ""Number two, you talked about the improvement of the offensive line. But you talk about drafting a tackle, top-six overall isn\'t a big deal if he\'s a really good player, it\'s 20% of the offensive line. If Ickey Ekwonu is what many offensive line people say he is going to be, that\'s a huge jump in their performance."" Before finally addressing Carolina\'s receivers: ""This is the best wide receiver group that Baker Mayfield has ever played with, and you can\'t debate that. Robby Anderson, DJ Moore and Rashard Higgins, that\'s the best wide receiver group he has ever had.""         Baker Mayfield\'s 2020 performance with the Cleveland Browns Oklahoma Spring Game Whenever fans of Baker Mayfield want to talk up his credentials, they immediately point to the 2020 season. During which he led the Browns to a 11-5 record, taking them to the postseason for the first time since 2002. He delivered their first playoff victory of the millennium against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Baker Mayfield had a passer rating of 95.9 with 3,563 passing yards, 26 touchdowns and eight interceptions that season. His completion percentage was still below 63%, despite throwing less than he had even done before, as the Browns became a run-heavy offense.

But what is glaringly obvious when comparing 2020 to his career numbers is that Baker Mayfield is inaccurate when under duress.     If you give him time to pass within a simplified system, with an excellent run game, then he can be effective when he plays within his limitations. It will be interesting to see how he gets on with Carolina.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit First Take and H/T Sportskeeda     ', ""NFL fans call out Baker Mayfield's wife for comparing Browns QB to Brett Favre and Drew Brees  Baker Mayfield's wife, Emily Wilkinson Mayfield, chose to stand up for her husband after he came in for fierce criticism following his interception-laden performance against the Green Bay Packers.

25,David Blough,"[""Is DeAndre Hopkins playing today against the Falcons? Week 17 injury update for the Cardinals WR  As per NFL Insider Jordan Schultz, DeAndre Hopkins has been declared out for today's game against the Atlanta Falcons. The Arizona Cardinals' injury woes have gotten worse as their season looks set to end with a whimper rather than a bang.  Before being seen leaving the practice pitch on Friday, Hopkins was a full participant on Wednesday and Thursday. Kliff Kingsbury later that day informed the press that the All-Pro wide receiver was doubtful to play because of knee problems during training. Colt McCoy, the second-string quarterback, has also been ruled out due to concussion-like symptoms.

David Blough will start at QB, with Colt McCoy in concussion protocol. https://t.co/4Ax4yYUPVz           For the seventh time this season, Hopkins will miss a game. The veteran wideout sat out the first six games of the season as he was suspended for testing positive for performance enhancing drugs. The Cardinals will start David Blough at quarterback today, which means they will start a different quarterback in four consecutive games. After Kyler Murray, McCoy, and Trace McSorley (who faltered in his inaugural league start last weekend against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers), Blough is Arizona's latest to start under center.     How important is DeAndre Hopkins to the Arizona Cardinals? DeAndre Hopkins tops the Arizona Cardinals with 64 receptions for 717 yards and three touchdowns in only nine games. This would have put him on track for more than 120 receptions and 1,300 yards for the entire 17-game season. Given that the Cardinals (4-11) are already out of the postseason picture and have nothing to compete for in the last two games of the 2022 season, it is anticipated that Hopkins will be kept out for the remainder of the campaign. This campaign, the Atlanta Falcons' defense has given up the ninth-most points to fantasy wide receivers. Hopkins recorded a season-low one catch on 10 targets in his last game versus the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for four yards. Although backup quarterback David Blough will be in charge of the offense, Marquise Brown and Greg Dortch are expected to play a larger role today. Against the Falcons, Marquise Brown might be regarded as a low-tier WR2 and could be a solid replacement in fantasy football.

Let's take a closer look at each of these new additions and how they might impact the upcoming season.        Arizona Cardinals signings           Kyzir White #43 of the Philadelphia Eagles tackles Travis Etienne Jr. #1 of the Jacksonville Jaguars L.J. Collier (DT) signed a one-year deal, providing much-needed depth to the defensive line after the departures of J.J. Watt and Zach Allen. Capable of playing across the line, Collier could start immediately or contribute significantly in a rotational role. The minimal risk associated with his one-year deal ensures that Collier can bring value to the team even if he doesn't reach starter status. Antonio Hamilton (CB) returns on a one-year deal, potentially reclaiming a starting position at cornerback after the loss of Byron Murphy. Having overcome serious burns last season to become a starter, Hamilton offers stability in a position needing further reinforcement. The low-risk one-year deal means that Hamilton can serve as a starter or role player depending on his performance.     Jonathan Ledbetter (DT) has re-signed on a one-year deal, looking to capitalize on his impressive but limited playing time last season. With the opportunity to earn significant playing time during OTAs and minicamp, Ledbetter brings plenty of upside with minimal risk. Former Philadelphia Eagle Zach Pascal (WR) joins the Cardinals on a two-year deal, adding depth to a receiving corps uncertain about its No. 1 option. Pascal's familiarity with head coach Jonathan Gannon from their time together in Philadelphia and Indianapolis offers added value. Competing for snaps with other role receivers, Pascal's role will be determined by his ability to crack the rotation. PHNX Cardinals@PHNX_CardinalsMeet your newest Arizona Cardinal, WR Zach Pascal.43226Meet your newest Arizona Cardinal, WR Zach Pascal. https://t.co/kYtDxCqkVa     David Blough (QB) returns to on a one-year deal and is currently the only healthy quarterback on the roster. His performances during OTAs and minicamp will determine whether he serves as a camp body or retains his third-string quarterback position from last year. With no risk associated with his signing, Blough's role is yet to be determined. Will Hernandez (OL) re-signed on a two-year deal, likely retaining his starting right guard position from last season. With a familiar face up front, Hernandez's primary risk is potential injury. Kyzir White (LB) agreed to a two-year deal with Arizona, adding depth to the outside linebacker position. Familiar with head coach Jonathan Gannon and defensive coordinator Nick Rallis from his time with the Eagles, White is expected to fill a variety of roles in Arizona's defense. With minimal risk, any sacks White contributes will be a bonus for the team's pass rush. Hjalte Froholdt (OL) joins on a two-year deal after starting games at both center and guard for the Cleveland Browns last season. Competing for starting roles at both positions, Froholdt offers depth and flexibility to the offensive line with little risk.     Kelvin Beachum (OT) re-signed on a two-year deal, providing stability to the offensive line. Expected to start at right tackle, Beachum's leadership and locker room presence make him a valuable asset to the team. The low-risk deal presents a bargain for the franchise Ezekiel Turner (LB) returns to on a one-year deal, continuing his role as a key special teams player. With minimal risk associated with his signing, Turner's contribution to the team remains consistent. Matt Prater (K) resigns on a two-year deal, bringing back an essential player on the roster. Despite a hip injury last season, the 38-year-old Prater remained consistent, making 22 of 25 field goals and 17 of 18 extra points. As a historically reliable kicker, Prater's primary challenge in 2023 will be maintaining his physical readiness, given his age. The main risk with Prater is injury, which could force the Cardinals to seek a replacement. Corey Clement (RB) re-signed with the Cardinals on a one-year deal, offering depth to the running back position. With only 15 carries for 55 yards and a touchdown in nine games last season, Clement will serve as a safety net for James Conner and compete for the backup role. Minimal risk is associated with Clement's signing, as his performances can only improve from last season.     Greg Dortch (WR) returns on a one-year deal, providing reliability as a depth receiver. Last season, Dortch recorded 52 catches for 467 yards and two touchdowns. PHNX Cardinals@PHNX_CardinalsPer the man himself, the Arizona Cardinals have resigned WR Greg Dortch.86844Per the man himself, the Arizona Cardinals have resigned WR Greg Dortch. https://t.co/213PWDhCcI While wide receiver remains a position the Cardinals must address, Dortch offers a solid weapon further down the depth chart. With little risk involved, Dortch can contribute as a third or fourth receiver and potentially serve as a kick returner. Notable Arizona Cardinals departures Defensive end J.J. Watt #99 reacts after a sack     The Cardinals faced significant roster changes during the offseason, starting with the retirement of defensive powerhouse J.J. Watt. Watt's departure leaves a void in the defensive line that the team must fill. Pickswise@PickswiseThe Cardinals surprised JJ Watt with a special retirement video before his final game 🥺(via @NFL)36049The Cardinals surprised JJ Watt with a special retirement video before his final game 🥺❤️(via @NFL)https://t.co/4wXc2tLK2a Another notable loss is Zach Allen, whose absence will further impact the Cardinals' pass rush. Allen had shown promise and versatility on the defensive line, and his departure will be felt. The Cardinals' secondary also took a hit with the loss of cornerback Byron Murphy. As a key player in the defensive backfield, Murphy's absence creates a gap the team must address to maintain a strong pass defense.On the offensive side, Arizona lost center Rodney Hudson, whose experience and consistency on the offensive line will be sorely missed. Hudson's departure necessitates finding a reliable replacement to protect quarterback Kyler Murray.     ""]"
26,Alex Smith,"[""NFL: 5 takeaways from Washington's Week 14 win over the 49ers  The once notorious NFC East division is now turning heads, with the Washington Football Team and New York Giants fighting for a playoff spot. On Sunday, the Giant lost against the Arizona Cardinals, pushing them to second place at 5-8, while Washington defeated the Arizona (formerly known as Arizona for their next two homes game) 49ers 23-15.  Washington improved their record to 6-7, having won four straight games now. They stand at first place in the NFC East division now and are poised to stay there if they continue their streak.        Here are 5 takeaways from Sunday's game.            5. Dwayne Haskins fills in just fine for Alex Smith Going into the second half, Alex Smith was questionable to return due to a calf strain in his right leg. This was the same leg in which Smith had his horrific injury, so concern was certainly there. But he did not enter into the game despite being prepared to do so on several occasions, which likely meant that Washington was taking it cautiously with him. In the post-game interview with head coach Ron Rivera, he stated that if they needed Smith to play, they would have put him. But it was clear the team was comfortable with Haskins filling in, and he seemed alright against the 49ers. While Haskins did not have any spectacular stats, he certainly had some good throws to the receivers and played better than Smith's performance in the second half. Fans should take his performance with a grain of salt however, considering his future with the team is still in question.      4. Washington's running back depth is good Washington was without their star rookie running back Antonio Gibson this week due to a toe turf injury. That meant the team would rely on J.D. McKissic and Peyton Barber, both who contributed well in the offense which was rather lacking against the 49ers. Combined they had 23 rushes for 105 yards and zero touchdowns, with several bursts during the game by both running backs. Hell of a reach block by Logan Thomas to spring the 11 yard run from McKissic pic.twitter.com/q0Tbox35BY— Nick Akridge (@PFF_NickAkridge) December 13, 2020     McKissic and Barber are both on two-year deals with the team, which will certainly help Gibson's growth with this team. But when needed, both of them have been crucial players, especially on third-down plays.  3. The 49ers are a very tough team The score cannot show this, but considering what head coach Kyle Shanahan and his team have gone through with the injuries, this team has held up very well. The 49ers should be considered to have one of the best depth-filled teams in the league. Fairfield's own has been ballin' all year.#ProBowlVote @Jfeeva_2📺 @NFLonFOX pic.twitter.com/kBet84MWuv— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) December 13, 2020     Quarterback Nick Mullens has filled in relatively well for the 49ers, though it seemed like in between the game that he would be replaced by C.J. Beathard. The 49ers defense is ranked 6th in the league, and credit goes to defensive coordinator Robert Saleh, who has utilized the players he still has left healthy in an amazing way. Saleh is certainly considered a hot ticket for a head coaching position in the upcoming 2021 off season.  2. Washington's secondary continues to improve Against the 49ers, the defense showed great spark defending against Mullens, who has thrown at least one interception in the last five games. Today, rookie safety Kam Curl took advantage of that, with a pick-6 right at the end of the 3rd quarter. Kam Curl is special folks. 💎 pic.twitter.com/M7vqumPjXG— Notorious Z (@DCzWall) December 13, 2020     Mullens completed 25 of 45 passes for 260 yards and a touchdown. Washington did allow receiver Brandon Aiyuk 119 receiving yards, but it was due to the 49ers great run-heavy offense that contributed to that.  1. Chase Young did something In all seriousness, rookie defensive end Chase Young has been performing at a level that no other rookie defensive end has in a while. Today, he showed what he can bring when he isn't being double or triple-teamed by opposing offensive linemen. CHASE YOUNG SCOOP AND SCORE TD That’s his first one in the NFL(via @NFL)pic.twitter.com/aG8oAzteyt— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) December 13, 2020Young had one sack, a forced fumble, a fumble return touchdown for the day. This marked the first player in Washington franchise history to achieve all three stats and only the 8th rookie in NFL history to do so.

He's been through it all in his NFL career. The comeback he made should be an inspiration to every quarterback that has had a setback due to an injury. Alex Smith may not be a Hall of Fame quarterback, but he's definitely a quarterback to look up to.     "", 'NFL: Washington\'s Steven Montez likes a demeaning tweet about teammate Dwayne Haskins  Things have gone from bad to worse for Washington Football Team\'s second-year quarterback, Dwayne Haskins.   Since the start of the season, he has been shaky with his performance as the starter. And after his start against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 4, Haskins was thrown under the bus by his own teammate on Twitter.        Undrafted rookie quarterback Steven Montez recently liked a tweet from a passionate Washington Football fan, who called Haskins \'garbage\'.           Washington backup QB Steven Montez likes tweet calling Dwayne Haskins ""garbage"" pic.twitter.com/ByAsRyQRK3— Main Team (@MainTeamSports) December 22, 2020 It\'s safe to say that most fans also agree that Haskins simply has not been competent enough during his run with Washington. Against the Seahawks, Haskins completed 38 of 55 passes for 295 yards with one touchdown and two passes. While he certainly made an effort to give Washington a win, it ultimately went in vain.  What is plaguing Dwayne Haskins?     Dwayne Haskins was benched and considered the third-string quarterback after his Week 4 performance against the Baltimore Ravens. He was placed behind Kyle Allen and veteran Alex Smith at that time.  After Kyle Allen\'s season-ending injury, Haskins was promoted to back up veteran Alex Smith, who has won four of five games as the starter. However, Smith strained his right calf against the San Francisco 49ers, rendering him unable to return to that game.  It seemed like the coaching staff wanted to be cautious with his calf, considering his horrendous injury back in 2018 on the same right leg.With the playoffs around the corner coupled with Smith\'s questionable performance in Week 16 against Carolina Panthers, Dwayne Haskins could be up for another start. But his recent off-field issue with violating the COVID-19 protocol, again could give another QB like Steven Montez a chance to take the helm for Washington.     ', ""NFL Week 17: QB Alex Smith cleared to start for Washington  Washington Football Team fans can finally breathe, as quarterback Alex Smith has been medically cleared to start against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night in the regular-season finale.  After injuring his right calf -- the same leg on which he had the devastating injury back in 2018 -- Smith has been out for the past few games. The injury occurred during a game against the San Francisco 49ers, and while Smith could have entered the game, the team remained cautious.        Since then, Smith missed two and a half games, with second-year quarterback Dwayne Haskins starting against the Seattle Seahawks and Carolina Panthers. Both games could have been winnable for the team and could have given Washington the playoff spot, but they were unable to do so.            Alex Smith is the key to Washington's offense There's no question that Smith is one of the reasons for Washington's success as of late. Since his first start against the Detroit Lions, Smith led them with a 4-1 record before being injured. With Smith being considered as the NFL Comeback Player of the Year, winning against the Eagles and helping Washington get the division title after returning from yet another injury will solidify the reason for him to receive the award even more. Alex Smith:*Told he might die*Told they might have to amputate*Told he might never walk again*Told he'd never play football again.*17 surgeriesTonight he starts for WSH w/a chance to clinch 1st division title since 2015.

Name the award after him— Matthew Berry (@MatthewBerryTMR) January 3, 2021     Now Smith's return in for Week 17 against the Eagles, which a must-win game for Washington, will certainly give this offense a boost. The offense has been lacking since his departure, as Haskins could not get things done in his absence and was released as a result of lackluster performance. With receiver Terry McLaurin and running back Antonio Gibson returning to the field, it will only help Smith and the offense even more.The Eagles will be without several key starters on both sides of the ball, which will help Washington on Sunday night.

He threw for 256 yards and four touchdowns in a 38-28 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers, including his first-ever touchdown -- a 58-yard pass to Tyreek Hill. He followed that up with another six-touchdown performance in Week 2 against the Pittsburgh Steelers with a passer rating of 154.8. He won back-to-back AFC Offensive Player of the Week awards for these two performances.     Mahomes' strong start to the season continued throughout the year as he consistently put up big numbers. He had a 3-week stretch of four touchdown games against the Patriots, Bengals, and Broncos. He also passed for over 300 yards in nine different games. This included a career-high 478 yards and six touchdowns in their Week 11 Monday Night Football classic 54-51 loss to the Rams -- a game that lives on in primetime history as one of the greatest. Oakland Raiders v Kansas City Chiefs     At the end of the regular season, Mahomes led the league in touchdown passes (50), passer rating (113.8), and yards per pass attempt (8.8). He also became the second player in NFL history to throw for over 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns in a season and only the seventh player to ever throw for 5,000 yards. Mahomes' impressive performances throughout the season earned him the NFL MVP award. He became the youngest quarterback to win the award at the age of 23, but Lamar Jackson broke the record the following year at age 22. Mahomes also led the Chiefs to the AFC Championship game, where they lost to the New England Patriots.Mahomes' 2018 NFL MVP season will be remembered as one of the greatest by a quarterback in NFL history.

The two-time Super Bowl champion led the Chiefs to their second Super Bowl victory in the last five years against the Philadelphia Eagles as they won 38-35.        Prior to his NFL career, Mahomes shone at Texas Tech University. The Chiefs were so impressed by Mahomes in college that they traded up for him in the 2017 NFL Draft.           In three seasons at Texas Tech, Mahomes threw for 11,252 yards, 93 touchdowns, and 29 interceptions. The most memorable game of Mahomes\' college career was against Baker Mayfield\'s Oklahoma Sooners on October 22, 2016. The two quarterbacks shone in a game that made NCAA history. The two combined for 12 touchdown passes and 1,279 passing yards. Mahomes accounted for 734 passing yards and five touchdowns. He also led Texas Tech in rushing yards with 85 and two rushing touchdowns.        Mahomes completed 52 out of 88 passing attempts, while Mayfield completed 27 out of 36 passes. The Sooners won by a score of 66-59 in an epic showdown in Luboock, Texas. Both quarterbacks ended up becoming first-round picks in the NFL. They met during the AFC divisional playoffs in 2021 as the Chiefs defeated Cleveland by a score of 22-17. Ahead of the divisional showdown, Mahomes recalled the legendary college game and was excited to play against Mayfield in the divisional playoffs. Mahomes said via ESPN: ""It\'s cool to get to play against him in such a big game, in the playoffs.

He sat behind Alex Smith during his rookie season and then won the league MVP in his first year as a starter the very next season. The following season in 2019, Mahomes led the Chiefs to the Super Bowl, defeating the San Francisco 49ers and winning Super Bowl MVP.        This past season, Mahomes won his second MVP, second Super Bowl and second Super Bowl MVP as he led the Chiefs to victory over the Eagles in one of the best Super Bowls of all-time.After his second Super Bowl victory at age 27, many think Mahomes has the chance to surpass Tom Brady at the end of his career.

News broke on Monday that the Washington Football Team had released quarterback Dwayne Haskins, an expected move after his performance against the Carolina Panthers in what was a must-win game for Washington to secure a spot in the playoffs.  Haskins had his ups and downs in the 2020 season, as the second-year QB started the first four games of the season, going 1-3. He was benched and demoted to third-string QB after that and Kyle Allen was named the starter, with veteran Alex Smith as the backup.

Eventually, Smith became the starting quarterback with Haskins being his backup. It wasn't expected for Haskins to ever see the field again unless Washington couldn't make it to the playoffs, but the day came when Smith was injured against the San Francisco 49ers and Haskins took over for the next two and a half games. His performance was average at best but was simply not good against the Panthers last week.      Will Dwayne Haskins ever see the field again? Many believe that Haskins' career as an NFL QB is simply done for. But since his rookie season, he has shown signs of being a star quarterback for a team willing to take a risk. Haskins is considered an old-school quarterback and not as mobile as many up-and-coming QBs in the league currently. That was one reason why he wasn't taken ahead of New York Giants' quarterback Daniel Jones in the same draft class. The fact of the matter is that Haskins needs to sit for a whole season behind a seasoned veteran, similar to Alex Smith. Teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers, New England Patriots, Atlanta Falcons, and even the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could sit a young guy who needs to mature over time to show what he can do on the field again.

Learn from this and bounce back— Robert Griffin III (@RGIII) December 28, 2020     He may not have worked out in the system that Washington has created, but Haskins could work out elsewhere. The situation brought to Haskins reminds us of Josh Rosen, who was drafted in the first round and then cut after one season with the Arizona Cardinals.Since then, he has been around a few teams and on practice squads. But Haskins certainly has more talent than Rosen, it's simply a matter of time and maturity for the former Ohio State quarterback.     "", ""Which NFL MVP candidate does Taylor Heinicke remind JD McKissic of?  Taylor Heinicke shone for the Washington Football Team as they defeated the New York Giants on Thursday Night Football. Heinicke stood in for the injured Ryan Fitzpatrick, just as he did for Alex Smith last year. The former XFL quarterback starred as his team outlasted the Giants in a thriller. The performance drew rave reviews from analysts and teammates.

McKissick speaks glowingly about Heinicke Heinicke's performance was so good that teammate and former Seahawk J.D. McKissick compared him to the Seahawks' star quarterback Russell Wilson. McKissick told reporters after the game: “He reminded me of Russell Wilson. He was calm. He wanted to make a play. He wanted to do anything it took. Only thing on his mind was winning.” Whenever anyone compares a player to Russell Wilson, it is high praise. Sometimes it's hyperbolic and brushed off as an in-the-moment line. McKissick, though, played with Wilson for three seasons, and the running back knows first-hand just how good Wilson is. In Thursday night's case, Heinicke fully deserved the praise. It is scarcely believable that he was a backup in the XFL, studying at Old Dominion before Ron Rivera rang him up last winter. Once again, Heinicke stepped up in relief of someone else and played his heart out.     Furthermore, it isn't people going overboard and getting caught with a case of recency bias. Heinicke plays like a modern NFL quarterback. He can scramble, use his legs on designed plays, and he throws with good velocity. NFL@NFLRicky Seals-Jones’ first catch with @WashingtonNFL?

Heinicke barely set his feet before unleashing a frozen rope into the endzone. It wasn't your average high-velocity pass coupled with zero accuracy. Heinicke stuck it on the top shelf, allowing his receiver to pluck it out of the air up high and come down with it.     No wonder his teammates are lavishing praise on him. It seems like the Washington Football Team will ride the Heinicke wave for the foreseeable future. His performance seemingly quashed any talk of Cam Newton or any other veteran quarterback heading to D.C.Taylor Heinicke fully deserved the adoration of the fans and his teammates. Now comes the tricky part.He must live up to these lofty expectations as the weeks go on in a long season. Heinicke, though, has defied all expectations to get here.

27,Brock Purdy,"['Brock Purdy: A Star is Revealed\xa0  Brock Purdy is the rookie quarterback who was the third choice for his team, the San Francisco 49ers. At the start of the season, it was unlikely that he would be able to win a playoff game as the starting quarterback. This was especially true considering he was selected as the 262nd overall pick in the seventh round of the draft.  It almost feels like this was destined to happen if you look at the uncommon circumstances that led to Purdy being the 49ers\' starting quarterback. At the start of the season, Trey Lance was given the nod as the starting quarterback over Jimmy Garoppolo.        Lance was injured in week 2, requiring ankle surgery and ending his season. Garappolo took over as the starter, but was injured in week 13, ending his season. The 49ers were now left with their third-choice QB, nicknamed ""Mr.Irrelevant,"" to lead the team.           NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Seattle Seahawks v San Francisco 49ers With the addition of Christian McCaffrey via trade from the Carolina Panthers,the 49ers are among the best teams in the league with a strong defense and a powerful running game.

However, he exceeded expectations by performing exceptionally well in his five weeks as the starting quarterback of the 2022 regular season. Brock threw for 1,374 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 4 interceptions, completing 67.1% of his passes. These numbers were unexpected, as only a handful of people believed that he would be able to perform at such a high level.  Can Purdy lead the 49ers to the Superbowl?      While Brock Purdy\'s performances during the regular season were impressive, many doubted his abilities in the playoffs, where even experienced quarterbacks have struggled. He proved himself yet again by delivering an impressive performance against the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday night, leading the team to a 41-23 victory. This showed that he is a star to watch out for and that his regular-season success was not a fluke.

He threw for 332 passing yards, 3 touchdowns, and 1 rushing touchdown.     He became the first quarterback to win a playoff game in their rookie season since Russell Wilson in 2012. He is also the first rookie quarterback with four touchdowns in their playoff debut. This was a historic achievement and further solidified his place as a star in the league The 49ers are a talented team with the potential to make it to the Superbowl. With Purdy\'s impressive performances in big games, many are now betting on the team to succeed. At the start of the season, it would have been hard to envision Purdy in this position. However, he has exceeded expectations and proven himself to be a valuable asset to the team.This season has been one to remember for Purdy, who has made history as a rookie quarterback. Whether or not the 49ers ultimately make it to the Superbowl, he has had an impressive season.     ', ""Could Brock Purdy become the first rookie quarterback to win a Super Bowl?  Brock Purdy will make history if he guides the San Francisco 49ers to a Super Bowl victory this season. No team has ever won “The Big Game” with a rookie signal-caller under center.  The Brock Purdy story truly seems like a Hollywood movie. Selected with the very last pick (seventh round, No. 262 overall) in the 2022 NFL Draft, he certainly wasn’t expected to see the field this year.        San Francisco opened the season with young starter Trey Lance—who the team mortgaged their future to acquire—and veteran Jimmy Garoppolo as the backup.           However, Lance would go down with a season-ending injury during the second game of the season. Ten games later, Garoppolo wound up hurting his foot and may be out for the year as well. With Lance and Jimmy G. sidelined, Purdy came to the rescue and is now a perfect 3-0 as the Niners’ starting QB. He went 16-for-21 with 185 yards and three total touchdowns in his first start as the team beat Tom Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers 35-7.

That’s not bad at all for a “Mr. Irreverent,” which, of course, is the nickname given to the last pick in the draft. Will Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers win the Super Bowl? Several rookie quarterbacks have played in the postseason over the years. While none of them have made the Super Bowl, six (Pat Haden, Dieter Brock, Shaun King, Ben Roethlisberger, Joe Flacco and Mark Sanchez) have reached a conference championship game. Purdy could very well pull off what other first-year QB’s from the past couldn’t. His Niners, who currently own a 11-4 record and have clinched a playoff spot, certainly have the firepower to win it all this year. They’re loaded on offense with weapons like George Kittle and Christian McCaffrey. Plus, their defense, led by Nick Bosa, is the best in the league.

Initially the third-string quarterback behind Jimmy Garoppolo and Trey Lance, he skyrocketed to the starting spot after injuries to both of them and made the most of his opportunity, winning his five regular-season starts and bringing the 49ers all the way to the NFC Championship Game.  But the magical run ended there, as he sustained an arm injury at the Philadelphia Eagles, only to be recalled after a concussion to Josh Johnson. Since then, Purdy has been busy rehabbing, but a former player believes the incoming so still has much to prove.        Former cornerback Will Blackmon recently visited Colin Cowherd on The Herd to discuss a variety of quarterback-related topics. Regarding Purdy, he said:           “We need to see it again. That’s how it always is. When somebody does something well, we need to see it again. Give us a full 18 [games].

The latest takes on Brock Purdy and his presumptive 2023 performance Brock Purdy has not spoken much during rehab; however, an insider has recently given insight into the process. ESPN\'s Jeff Darlington recently said on Threads (a new chatting app recently launched by Facebook parent company Meta): ""If he continues on his current rehab trajectory, I don’t think there’s much question about it. Kyle Shanahan feels pretty confident Purdy will be ready. Purdy has been rehabbing and training in Jacksonville with QB coach Will Hewlett, and he continues to make good progress."" Jeff Darlington\'s comments on Brock Purdy\'s recovery (image via Threads)     However, not everyone agrees that Purdy will be the franchise face that he has been hyped to potentially be. On Sunday, FanSided\'s Peter Panacy claimed that Purdy would not be the starting quarterback by the end of the season: ""Purdy has already pushed fellow QBs, Trey Lance and Sam Darnold, down the depth chart. But, what if Purdy\'s mini hot streak to close out the 2022 season was merely a case of beginner\'s luck? What if all the reasons why Purdy went undrafted until the final pick of 2022 come to the surface?""It might not be ideal for anyone but Lance and Darnold, but this bold prediction suggests Purdy winds up losing his grip on the Niners\' starting job.""

Popularly known as Mr. Irrelevant, he was named a third-string quarterback in his rookie season, behind Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo.   However, injuries to the two top quarterbacks gave Purdy a shot at the starting role. It's been an amazing story for the Iowa State alum ever since.        Capitalizing on the injuries of his teammates, Purdy got his first start in a win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in December 2022. The match gave him the distinction of being the sole quarterback to defeat a team led by Tom Brady in his inaugural career start.

Purdy became the second player in the history of the NFL, after Aaron Rodgers, to attain a combined quarterback rating of 115 or higher in his first two starts.     Purdy finished the regular season with five starts. He won every one of them. He also threw for 1,374 yards for 13 touchdowns and four interceptions. The Queen Creek native played a crucial role in securing the San Francisco 49ers the second seed in the playoffs. Purdy's impressive performance was a key factor in the team's 10-game winning streak, which led the 49ers to clinch the division title and secure a spot in the NFC Championship Game. Injury in the game against the Philadelphia Eagles affected his performance and eventually denied the 49ers a Super Bowl appearance. Could Brock Purdy start for the San Francisco 49ers? Trey Lance     With Jimmy Garoppolo moving on to join the Las Vegas Raiders, Trey Lance appears to be the main competition for Purdy. Lance had his season cut short by injury last year after he was named the starting quarterback, which offers Purdy an advantage here. Lance's first-round draft pick status may suggest he should start as the quarterback in the opinion of many NFL enthusiasts. The statistics, however, make it evident that Purdy is the ideal candidate to take on the role of the 49ers' starting quarterback.

Brock Purdy surprised everyone with his performance as he crippled the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday in the week 14 matchup. Purdy started his first game of the season and led the San Francisco 49ers to a 35-7 win over the Tom Brady-leading Buccaneers.  The 49ers selected him as the 262nd and final pick of the 2022 NFL draft. No one would have imagined that he would play such a big role for the 49ers as he was the third choice on the quarterback depth chart after Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo.

Purdy played in three games with one start for Florida State. In addition to rushing 19 times for 57 yards, he completed 27 of his 53 passes for 219 yards and two touchdowns. In 2020, he began the game against North Carolina State and finished 15 of 23 for 181 yards and two touchdowns.

Purdy came into a very good team, when the starting quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo went down injured, and now they are in Super Bowl contention. This is very similar to Tom Brady\'s story. From the 199th pick of the NFL Draft, Brady went on to become arguably the greatest quarterback the NFL has ever seen. Similarly, Mr. Irrelevant, who was the last pick in this year\'s draft, now looks to be leading a franchise capable of winning the Super Bowl.

LeBron James certainly seemed excited by the way the San Francisco 49ers and Brock Purdy played. That could have been surprising to some of the observers, given he plays for the Los Angeles Lakers. One would have expected him to support the Los Angeles Chargers, who are also playing today. While James is a football fan, he does not support any Los Angeles teams. Who he really supports is his hometown team: the Cleveland Browns. However, he did not grow up supporting them. He grew up as a fan of the Dallas Cowboys and only recently switched to the Browns. He stopped supporting the Cowboys as Dallas took an antagonistic stance initially on players kneeling during the national anthem. This caused him to switch to his hometown team. He has also been seen attending Los Angeles Rams games, which is not surprising considering he also plays in the area.

He grew up playing the game but eventually chose his hand at basketball. It\'s fun to imagine him still playing football as a great tight end. That, of course, remains a fantasy for now. But what Brock Purdy is achieving this season is nothing short of a miracle in itself.

""Mr. Irrelevant"" in the 2022 NFL Draft, Purdy has proved many fans wrong during his rookie campaign. He\'s yet to lose as a starter for San Francisco.  To say his rise to the top of the NFL tree is a surprise is something of an understatement. Many expected the 49ers’ season to collapse after injuries to Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo.        Purdy leads his team into Philadelphia to face the Eagles next Sunday. He’s arguably put together the best playoff performances for a rookie quarterback in NFL history.

Flacco led the Ravens to a 11-5 record and a playoff berth, where he managed to win two games. As the 6th seed, Flacco helped Baltimore win two road playoff games against the Dolphins and Titans. He threw for one touchdown and zero interceptions in both games. He proved to be an excellent game manager but crumbled in the AFC Championship game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Flacco was intercepted three times, losing 14-23. His excellent rookie season ended abruptly. #4 – Russell Wilson Detroit Lions v Seattle Seahawks     Many NFL fans were shocked when Russell Wilson was named the starter prior to his rookie year with the Seattle Seahawks. He was selected in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft. Seattle paid Matt Flynn handsomely that same offseason. But the decision was vindicated as Wilson led the Seahawks to the playoffs in his rookie campaign. Wilson and the Seahawks beat Washington in the Wild Card round, but narrowly lost out to the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional round. He impressed in his postseason debut as he passed for three touchdowns and had a 102.4 QB rating. Most surprising rookie performances in NFL playoff history #3 – Ben Roethlisberger Pittsburgh Steelers v New York Giants     Ben Roethlisberger had arguably the greatest rookie season for a QB in NFL history. He carried that into the postseason. Most fans and analysts alike expected the 2004 first-overall pick Eli Manning to steal the spotlight. But it was Big Ben and the Pittsburgh Steelers who marched to a 13-0 start on their way to securing the 1st seed in the AFC. After their bye-week, Roethlisberger helped Pittsburgh beat the New York Jets 20-17. Big Ben threw a game-tying touchdown pass late in the game. The next week wasn’t quite so fruitful. Tom Brady and the Patriots beat them 41-27 to give them their first loss of the season. Roethlisberger still had two touchdown passes and threw for 226 yards.  #2 – Mark Sanchez Miami Dolphins v New York Jets     Much to the shock of the NFL world, Mark Sanchez made it to the playoffs in his debut campaign and was excellent. The New York Jets signal-caller overcame both the Cincinnati Bengals and San Diego Chargers on the road. The 5th seed Jets made it to the AFC Championship game. Despite leading at halftime, they would succumb to Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts. Even in defeat, Sanchez had an excellent game. He threw for two touchdowns. Sanchez finished the postseason with four passing touchdowns and only one interception. #1 – Brock Purdy NFC Divisional Playoffs - Dallas Cowboys v San Francisco 49ers     Brock Purdy was selected 256th overall in this year’s NFL draft. He is now just one game away from leading the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl. Purdy rose to the occasion following injuries to both Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo. He hasn’t looked out of place in the NFL, both in the regular season and postseason. Since taking over as the starter, Purdy has remained undefeated. He\'s won five regular-season games and a pair of playoff games. In his playoff debut, Purdy had three passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown in a blowout 41-23 win over the Seattle Seahawks. This was another record-breaking game for Purdy. His four touchdowns were the most by a rookie in the playoffs in league history. He also led them through a tough divisional game against the Dallas Cowboys. The 49ers will have their hands full against the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship game.

During Monday\'s episode of Undisputed on FS1, Sharpe was highly critical of Brady\'s performance, calling out the quarterback for his poor performance while passing the ball. Brady completed only 34 of his 55 pass attempts for 253 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.         Tom Brady debate sparks petty argument between Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe           Bayless offered poor retorts to Sharpe\'s legitimate criticism of Tom Brady\'s performance, before accusing the NFL Hall of Famer of being jealous of the seven-time Super Bowl champion. When Sharpe called out Bayless for claiming that Brady watches more film than the Buccaneers coaching staff and that the quarterback was the one to blame for the team\'s blowout loss against the 49ers, the latter responded: ""This is straight hate by a guy who is jealous that he\'s still playing at a high level at 45, when you [Sharpe] had to stop at 35. That\'s the point."" Sharpe replied: ""Skip, that\'s what you do. Every time I call something into question, [you claim] I am jealous. I did what I did. You make it sound like I was a bum. I\'m in the NFL Hall of Fame. I got three Super Bowls.""     Bayless snapped back: ""So what? [Brady\'s] way better than you were!"" A visibly upset Sharpe took his glasses off and continued to argue his case: ""You are willing to take a personal shot at me. To say this man is better than me because I said he\'s playing bad this year?"" Watch the entire argument below:     Bayless responded that Sharpe\'s comments about Tom Brady were disrespectful and the former NFL star responded that the veteran analyst\'s jibe at him was just as disrespectful. The argument eventually cooled down after Sharpe took a backseat and allowed Bayless to make his case and defend Brady\'s performance against the 49ers. What started off as a passionate debate devolved into a petty argument.      ']"
28,Daniel Jones,"[""Do Daniel Jones' performances warrant a $160m contract? Analyzing the Giants QB's NFL career  Daniel Jones has agreed to a deal to extend his contract with the New York Giants after weeks of negotiations.  The quarterback has signed a four-year deal worth $160 million, plus the opportunity to earn an additional $35 million in incentives. This came as a shock to many in the NFL world, who thought Jones' performances did not warrant his contractual demands.         The Giants may have made a mistake when they decided against exercising the fifth-year option on his previous contract. This brought the team and Jones' representation to the negotiating table earlier than perhaps it should, where the two parties had some friction during the early phase of talks.           Tom Pelissero@TomPelisseroThe #Giants are signing QB Daniel Jones to a new four-year, $160 million contract with $35 million in incentives, per source.

Meanwhile, fans and analysts alike are stuck on the size of the contract. Daniel Jones has played four seasons with the franchise since being selected as the 6th overall pick in the 2019 draft. Do his performances warrant this massive deal?     Daniel Jones has been enigmatic with the Giants Philadelphia Eagles v New York Giants Jones began his career behind Eli Manning after signing a four-year rookie contract worth $25.6 million. However, he started 12 of the 13 games he played that season. Jones finished the season with 3,027 passing yards, 24 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He also rushed for 279 yards and 2 touchdowns on 45 attempts. A very promising start for a rookie. He was named the starting quarterback the following season, but regressed. He started 14 games in the 2020 campaign, throwing for 2,943 yards, 11 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He also rushed for 423 yards and a touchdown on 65 attempts. In an increasingly pass-heavy league, this regression was sternly critiqued by the media.     Art Stapleton@art_stapletonDaniel Jones' contract has $82 million in guarantees, paid out over the first two years.If Giants were forced to use the franchise tag on Jones each of the next two years, the cap hits would've been ~$72 million over the next two years.Sounds like DJ will get $82M over 4.104188Daniel Jones' contract has $82 million in guarantees, paid out over the first two years.If Giants were forced to use the franchise tag on Jones each of the next two years, the cap hits would've been ~$72 million over the next two years.Sounds like DJ will get $82M over 4. The stats didn't get any better in Jones' third season in the NFL. He recorded 2,428 passing yards and 10 touchdowns in 11 games, going along with 7 interceptions. That campaign also saw him rush for 298 yards and 2 touchdowns. He, however, made an improvement on his fumbles where he had led the league in his first two seasons (18 with 11 lost, 11 with 6 lost, 7 with 3 lost, respectively). The 2022 season was Daniel Jones' best in many ways. He had career-high numbers in almost every category, which contributed to this contract. Jones threw for 3,205 passing yards, 10 touchdowns and 5 interceptions. He also rushed for 708 yards and 7 touchdowns on 120 attempts. He fumbled the ball 6 times, 3 of which resulted in a change of possession.     Overall, Daniel Jones has thrown for 11,603 yards, 60 touchdowns and 34 interceptions in the NFL. He has also rushed for 1,708 yards and 12 touchdowns on a total of 292 attempts. He has recorded a passing accuracy of 64% in 54 regular season games. Philadelphia Eagles v New York Giants  Looking at these stats, Daniel Jones' performances do not warrant a $160 million deal. A 10 passing touchdown season is not hugely inspiring, and it seems the Giants made a mistake in not picking up his fifth-year option. If they had, they would benefit from another year to evaluate him.     What goes in Daniel Jones' favor, however, is that the Giants have been a tumultuous team since he was drafted. He has put up respectable numbers (albeit with some concerns) for three different head coaches with a relatively weak offense. The Giants have seen star running back Saquon Barkley fall victim to a string of injuries and overall, Jones could have done a lot worse. Daniel Jones currently holds a few franchise records, especially for his rookie season. He has the most pass attempts and the highest percentage for a rookie with 459 and 61.9% respectively. He is also the first Giants quarterback to throw 2500+ passing yards and 400+ rushing in a single season.With his contract extended for the foreseeable future, Jones will look to prove his nay-sayers wrong and reward his franchise for their trust.     "", 'Giants QB Daniel Jones secures big payday with playoff win vs Vikings, claims ex-NFL HC Mike Smith  Mike Smith reckons New York Giants QB Daniel Jones has secured a huge payday with his performance in the team\'s Wild Card win over the Minnesota Vikings.  He played a great game, establishing himself as a dual-threat quarterback on the biggest stage in the NFL. While there have been many persistent doubts about his ability over the years, the Giants QB has shone in the league this year. His latest performances on the road were exceptional, as the Giant became the only team to win against an opposition with a better regular season record away from home.        Jones picked the perfect time to prove his doubters wrong, as there were doubts if he could remain the starting quarterback for the Giants. He has essentially silenced all such speculation for now. The Giants will do well to lock him up for a new and improved contract. Based on the going rate of quarterbacks in the league, that will not come cheap, though.           One person who believes that he deserves every penny is ex-Falcons coach Mike Smith. Speaking exclusively to Sportskeeda\'s ""The BallFather Podcast,"" he said: ""Hey, he just got some more money. There\'s no doubt about that. Yeah, you know, we\'ll talk about it. But, you know Daniel Jones, and he\'s playing some good football right now. And he\'s got a chance to be a good quarterback. I don\'t know that he\'s ranked as one of the elite quarterbacks in the league. But he\'s at that, you know, he\'s at that next level.""     Coach Smith said that Jones is now just below elite level quarterbacks. Undoubtedly, he can reach that level if he keeps performing like this constantly. Smith also reserved special praise for coach Brian Daboll, who has turned the franchise and the quarterback\'s fortunes around, saying: ""He\'s starting to play a lot better than he has early in his career. And you got to give that to the, you know, to Daboll and his coaching staff for what they\'ve been able to do to get him turned around and going in the right direction.""

A Data-Driven Analysis of the Giants QB  New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones has been a topic of much debate among fans and analysts since his NFL entrance in 2019. Some believe that he is a highly talented quarterback with a bright future, while others argue that he is overrated and not worthy of his sixth-overall draft position.  Here, we will look at his performances and stats from his rookie season to this very moment in an attempt to determine his true value.         His league entrance made him the heir apparent to then-Giants quarterback Eli Manning, who was in the latter stages of his career. Jones was poised to take over as the team's starting quarterback and the Giants and fans had high hopes for his future.           NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Daniel Jones Jones played his first game for the Giants in a loss against the Dallas Cowboys when he came in to relieve Manning. He started his first game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and led his team to an 18-point comeback win.     He threw for 336 yards and two touchdowns, and recorded two rushing touchdowns in his debut start. This performance made him the first Giants quarterback to win his first starting game since Scott Brunner in 1980. evin@KayvonOjulariDaniel Jones QB rankings over the past month:EPA/Play: 1stPasser rating: 3rdAdj.

He accomplished this feat as he led the Giants to an overtime victory over the Washington Redskins.     The game solidified his position as the team's starting quarterback. He finished his rookie season with 3,027 passing yards, 24 passing touchdowns, and two rushing touchdowns. However, he also led the league in fumbles with 18, losing 11 of them. With a 3-9 record in his rookie season, 5-9 in 2020, and 4-7 in 2021, the Giants declined his fifth-year option in his contract. This meant that he was required to prove himself in 2022 to secure a long-term contract with the team. Jones and the Giants, nonetheless, had an impressive start to the 2022 season with a 6-1 record in their first seven games. Their regular season ended with a 9-6-1 record, marking the first winning season of Jones' career, in addition to his first playoff appearance. He had his best regular-season numbers in most categories, except for passing touchdowns. He ended the season with a 67.2% pass completion rate, 3,205 passing yards, and 15 passing touchdowns. Additionally, he rushed for 708 yards and seven touchdowns. This was a solid performance from him and a clear improvement from his previous seasons.      Daniel Jones' magical moment in the sun in the 2022-23 NFL playoffs The Giants signal-caller amassed a lot of praise and comparisons to the league's best in his first playoff appearance, which came against the Minnesota Vikings on Wild Card weekend. He set an NFL record for being the first player to throw for 300+ yards, two passing touchdowns, no picks, and rush for 70 yards in a playoff game. NFC Divisional Playoffs - New York Giants v Philadelphia Eagles     The divisional round game against the Philadelphia Eagles was a different story. The Eagles won the game 38-7. The Giants shot-caller threw for 135 yards and had zero touchdowns, with one interception. It was a poor performance from him, especially coming off a career high. The question on most people's lips is whether or not he is overrated, given the ups and downs of his career. Paul Schwartz@NYPost_SchwartzJoe Schoen on Daniel Jones: “We’d like Daniel to be here.”371Joe Schoen on Daniel Jones: “We’d like Daniel to be here.” https://t.co/xz6qgJLUVA Jones will be a free agent in the offseason. However, Giants general manager Joe Schoen said that they are willing to move forward with Jones as they are satisfied with his performance.However, his numbers still raise the question of whether the Giants will offer him a huge contract or if he will still be with the Giants' franchise quarterback.     "", ""What does Daniel Jones’ $160 million contract mean for Giants’ future?  Daniel Jones will stay with the New York Giants, signing a lucrative $160 million contract, but what does this mean for Big Blue?  First, it means that the Giants have their quarterback for the foreseeable future. There will be no more speculation about Jones’ suitability to the position.        Such discourse would be pointless. Regardless of the fans’ opinions on Jones, he’s here to stay. Unfortunately for the QB, a lot of the negativity has lingered due to his selection in the draft coming as a complete shock.           Jones’ performances in 2022 were a big improvement. He took the team back to the playoffs and the team had a competitive offense, albeit one that was led by Saquon Barkley and the running game. With Barkley being franchise-tagged this offseason, it’s obvious that the Giants gave some numbers to work out ahead of 2024. However, getting your QB position settled is vitally important, and they feel they have done that. Just what are the positives of Daniel Jones’ extension? Brian Daboll is widely credited with New York’s success in the 2022 season. His coaching brought a different atmosphere to the locker room, and the team is no longer a pushover in a poor division.     Is there a long way to go before they compete with the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys? Yes, but signing Jones to a long-term deal at least gives them stability. Positive 1: Stability  When you don’t have an exceptional quarterback on a rookie deal, your options to build a Super Bowl winning roster are limited. You cannot go out and make lucrative trades on draft night, which provides you with a receiving weapon that takes your offense to a new level. Teams who are paying their QB a big salary need to be smart; they need to plan. Half the battle is knowing where your money is going and how best to utilize what’s left over. This will be key to the Giants’ fortunes moving forward. Drafting will be important as signing free agents will be more challenging. It allows the franchise to plan. The Giants know where they stand.     Connor Hughes@Connor_J_HughesDaniel Jones re-signing press conference is underway. Jones said he didn't value one thing more than another, just wanted balance between everything — years, value, average, etc. #Giants466Daniel Jones re-signing press conference is underway. Jones said he didn't value one thing more than another, just wanted balance between everything — years, value, average, etc. #Giants Positive 2: Jones is improving  Whether you want to believe this or not, Daniel Jones has improved as a quarterback over the past year. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that he will continue to improve. He’s just 25 years old, he has at least six more years at his physical peak and you never stop improving mentally. His 2022 stats made for good reading. The QB’s returns of nine wins and 3,205 passing yards were both career highs. He also threw just five interceptions, which was a career low. One of the biggest criticisms of Jones had been turnovers. However, cleaning that up was one of his biggest improvements last year.     Jones was in the running for the Associated Press’ Comeback Player of the Year, citing the jumps forward he made. Positive 3: Jones adds variety to New York’s offense  It wasn’t just in the passing game where the former Duke starter made a difference in 2022. Jones rushed for a career-high 708 yards and seven touchdowns. These are hugely important scoring numbers for a QB. It gave the NYG offense variety and stopped teams being able to just plan for Barkley. Having an unpredictable offense is crucially important in the current NFL. Just look at the Eagles and the San Francisco 49ers. They thrive with it. Jones must improve – we know that – but 2022 showed that the building blocks of a dynamic play style were there, and that’s what convinced the Giants to pay him. But what are the negatives of Daniel Jones’ extension?     The reaction from fans to Tuesday’s news hasn’t been universally positive. There are still those who don’t believe Jones has it in him to lead a team to the Super Bowl. His first three seasons were plagued with errors in a way that Patrick Mahomes’ just weren’t. That is the level of comparison. Negative 1: Jones has yet to fully convince  Jones threw 29 interceptions in his first three years and never had a winning record. These numbers were seriously alarming, and nobody believed the Giants would keep Jones beyond his fourth year. Given the quality of the QBs in the 2023 draft class, many expected New York to struggle in 2022 and then have a high pick. While Jones’ vastly improved displays prevented that, some still aren’t all in on the quarterback. Big Blue United@BigBlueUnitedAccording to Mike Florio, Daniel Jones' contract is actually 3 years worth $112.5M with an average of $37.5M a season. Giants could escape the deal after two years, with $82M already paid and $12M in 2025 guarantees that would be subject to offset.

Giants could escape the deal after two years, with $82M already paid and $12M in 2025 guarantees that would be subject to offset. Full details... ⬇️ https://t.co/pCi00HbTNf     He still makes mistakes, and the Giants offense was heavily aided by the running game. In 18 games without Saquon Barkley, Jones has thrown 14 interceptions and has a passer rating of just 80.3. He has also won just eight games without the running back. In 2022, Barkley finished a full season, but any injury to him and fans who aren’t convinced will point to these worrying trends. Negative 2: Dan Jones is being wildly overpaid  The QB position is the most valuable in the NFL. As such they are paid the most money. Recent contract extensions for Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson and Deshaun Watson have inflated the value of the role even more. It’s so hard to find a proper QB that teams often reach for ones they think they have. Jones has only played at a high-quality standard for one of his four NFL seasons, but he left the Giants with no choice but to pay him.     The risk of allowing him to walk was too great, especially as he looks to be improving. However, he is being wildly overpaid. He will earn roughly as much as Dak Prescott and Matthew Stafford on an annual basis. He will outearn Lamar Jackson, too. Jones isn’t better than any of those quarterbacks, but the Giants had to pay him because there wasn’t a better option.This could cause problems down the line. If deficiencies in his game remain, then the salary will become a millstone around the neck of the New York Football Giants. We all know that this can cripple a franchise competitively for years.

He has attempted 472 passes and has completed 317 of them.It has been one of his best seasons so far, and many NFL teams will be looking forward to signing a deal with the star quarterback for the 2023 season.     "", ""Fantasy Football Start 'Em Sit 'Em 2022 NFL Week 11: Quarterback rankings  Streaming quarterbacks have become a popular strategy in Fantasy Football. It has also proven to be successful when executed properly. Quarterbacks are often the highest scoring players in Fantasy Football, so it's always important to capitalize on their position.  With the exception of a few elite options that need to be started every week regardless of matchup, the rest of the field should be closely analyzed. Especially when determining which quarterback to start in a given week. One of the best ways to do so is by looking at their recent performances as well as their direct weekly matchups to find a favorable situation.        NFL Week 11 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks: Start 'Em           Justin Fields - Chicago Bears vs. Atlanta Falcons Chicago Bears QB Justin Fields Justin Fields is quickly becoming one of the top quarterbacks in Fantasy Football. His fantasy score has finished among the top ten quarterbacks in each of his last five consecutive games. This includes finishing as the QB1 in each of the last two weeks. Fields' rushing abilities have been a major reason for his recent success. He has combined for 325 rushing yards in his last two games. He gets an opportunity in Week 11 against the Atlanta Falcons. They rank in the bottom ten in fantasy points allowed to quarterbacks.     Daniel Jones - New York Giants vs. Detroit Lions New York Giants QB Daniel Jones Daniel Jones has proven to be a solid streaming quarterback in the right matchups. He has finished inside the top ten in fantasy points twice during the 2022 season so far.         Week 11 presents an ideal situation for Jones to turn in another strong performance in Fantasy Football. The Detroit Lions are currently allowing the most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks. Marcus Mariota - Atlanta Falcons vs. Chicago Bears Atlanta Falcons QB Marcus Mariota The entire Atlanta Falcons offense should benefit from the return of Cordarrelle Patterson. He adds a dynamic element to the rushing and passing games. This includes Marcus Mariota, who is already a streaming option in favorbale matchups. He has finished inside the top ten four times this year.     Facing off against the Chicago Bears should allow Mariota to show off his dual-threat skillset. Their entire defense has struggled since trading away Roquan Smith to the Baltimore Ravens. They rank in the bottom five in total fantasy points allowed. NFL Week 11 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks: Sit 'Em Derek Carr - Las Vegas Raiders vs. Denver Broncos Las Vegas Raiders QB Derek Carr Derek Carr has been one of the most disappointing quarterbacks during the 2022 Fantasy Football season. Despite adding superstar Davante Adams to his offense this season, he has regressed in just about every statistical category compared to last year.     Things won't get any easier for Carr in Week 11. The Denver Broncos are currently allowing the least fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks. The game will also be played in Denver, one of the most difficult stadiums to play in for visiting teams. Kirk Cousins - Minnesota Vikings vs. Dallas Cowboys Minnesota Vikings QB Kirk Cousins Kirk Cousins has been relatively productive during the 2022 Fantasy Football season. He currently ranks 12th among quarterbacks in total fantasy points this year, putting him right on the borderline of being a consistent starter.         Week 11 may prove to be one of the most difficult challenges for Cousins this year. The Dallas Cowboys currently lead the NFL in total sacks during the 2022 season, so he will likely be under pressure from Micah Parsons. They also rank seventh in fantasy points allowed to quarterbacks. Jared Goff - Detroit Lions vs. New York Giants Detroit Lions QB Jared Goff     Jared Goff opened the 2022 Fantasy Football season with two top ten finishes in his first four games. This includes finishing with the top fantasy score of all players in Week 4 when he did so against the Seattle Seahawks. Goff has struggled since his hot start. He has finished outside the top 15 quarterbacks every week since his QB1 performance. It will be difficult to break out of his slump against the New York Giants. They are one of only 12 teams allowing fewer than 16 fantasy points per game to quarterbacks.

They also have holes up and down the roster that they need to fix as well. However, the late-year winning streak makes fans wonder how much change they will see before 2022.     "", 'Eli Manning shares state of confidence in Daniel Jones ahead of Giants training camp  Eli Manning is well aware of how brutal the New York Giants fan base can be, having spent his entire 16-season career as quarterback of the NFC East franchise. The two-time Super Bowl champion recently discussed where quarterback Daniel Jones stands entering the 2023 NFL season.  Giants fans are known to have extremely polarizing opinions that they aren\'t shy about sharing in a New York market that is famous for keeping players under the microscope.        Manning spent his entire career in this situation and Jones is now in the position that the two-time Super Bowl MVP once held.           Manning praised Jones for the way he\'s handled the spotlight so far and expressed confidence in the 26-year-old\'s ability to develop his game. ""It\'s hard in New York. Every game you could come in and throw four touchdowns and they\'re saying you\'re the greatest player and you\'re the MVP. The next week you can throw two interceptions and they\'re saying you\'re a bust and a big mistake. ""I think that he\'s handled that so well these four years. Each year he\'s made improvements. He\'s seen things he needs to work on and he\'s fixed them ... so he can rise to the occasion, he can win the big game. So, I think we\'ll just continue to see him grow and take more of that leadership role.""

His career has been a bit of a roller coaster so far, but he enjoyed a breakout 2022 season. In his first postseason appearance, he helped the Giants defeat the Minnesota Vikings before being eliminated by the Philadelphia Eagles. His performances earned him a massive contract extension, making him the Giants\' franchise quarterback for the foreseeable future      If Daniel Jones can build off his success from last season, he can join Manning one day in the pantheon of Giants greats. Eli Manning\'s postseason success Eli Manning Eli Manning helped the New York Giants make it to the NFL playoffs six times. In four of those appearances, he failed to win a single game. His other two trips to the postseason solidified his legacy as a Giants legend and potentially a future member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.     In the playoffs following the 2007 and 2011 NFL seasons, Manning led the Giants to the Super Bowl trophy. He won four games in each of those two postseason runs, bringing his career playoff record to 8-4, despite being winless in four appearances.Both of his two rings came by defeating the New England Patriots, including ruining what would have been an undefeated season for Tom Brady.

He has 30 fumbles in 28 career games, which is just not good enough. His decision-making also has to improve. With one particular play that resulted in a fumble, Daniel Jones had enough time to slide on the run but chose instead not to do so.     Taylor Heinicke, Washington Football Team Taylor Heinicke is not a starter with the Washington Football Team. That honor belongs to Ryan Fitzpatrick, but Taylor Heinicke is making something of a name of being the emergency quarterback. Timeline update: WFT QB Ryan Fitzpatrick, who is being placed on injured reserve today, is expected to miss 6-8 weeks with the hip injury he suffered Sunday, per source.Taylor Heinicke time.— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) September 13, 2021 He had a stellar start last year, even in the loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the playoffs. He had to come in as an emergency quarterback replacement again in the first game of the 2021 NFL season after Ryan Fitzpatrick suffered a hip injury. Coming in, he did a fine job completing 11 of 15 passes with a touchdown.     The final verdict Everything on paper seems tilted towards Daniel Jones. He is a former first-round pick for the New York Giants, finally getting to lead his team. On the field, though, his performances have left much to be desired, especially in relation to fumbles and decision-making. Taylor Heinicke, on the other hand, is not a superstar yet. What he has done instead is consistent application and error reduction to make sure he gives the best service to the team.Comparing both of them for this match, I believe that Taylor Heinicke will lead the Washington Football Team to a victory over Daniel Jones and the New York Giants.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 2 TV Schedule     "", ""Fantasy Football Start 'Em Sit 'Em 2022 NFL Week 15: Quarterback rankings  Week 15 of the 2022 Fantasy Football season marks the beginning of the playoffs in most leagues.

He has finished inside the top ten quarterbacks in each of his last seven games, including five top-fives and two QB1's. While the Philadelphia Eagles have an excellent defense, Fields should be trusted in the fantasy lineup for as long as his scorching hot streak continues.     Dak Prescott - Dallas Cowboys vs. Jacksonville Jaguars Dallas Cowboys QB Dak Prescott Dak Prescott will be looking to bounce back in Week 15 following a disappointing performance last week against the Houston Texans.

NFL Week 15 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks: Sit 'Em Derek Carr - Las Vegas Raiders vs. New England Patriots     Las Vegas Raiders QB Derek Carr While Davante Adams continues to be one of the best wide receivers during the Fantasy Football season, Derek Carr has been one of the most disappointing quarterbacks.

29,Jared Goff,"[""NFL 2020: Top 5 quarterback performances from Sunday (Week 5)  It was a bit of a quieter Sunday than normal for NFL and its quarterbacks in Week 5, as two games on the schedule were pushed back or postponed because of players testing positive for COVID-19.  Nonetheless, it was a fascinating week with several upsets, including the Las Vegas Raiders topping Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, the Miami Dolphins defeating the San Francisco 49ers, and the New York Giants getting close to taking down the Dallas Cowboys.        Here are Sunday's top five quarterback performances around the league.            #5 Jared Goff Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jared Goff The Los Angeles Rams had an opportunity for an easy win over the Washington Football team, and Jared Goff took advantage of it. Goff completed 21 of 30 passes for 309 yards with two passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown. He threw one interception and finished with a 111.7 passer rating. 309 passing yards for QB1 👏@JaredGoff16's best throws from the 30-10 win! pic.twitter.com/ubl9ir0iYF— Los Angeles Rams (@RamsNFL) October 11, 2020     The No. 1 pick in the 2016 NFL Draft is still young at just 25 years of age, and he's becoming much more accurate as the weeks go by. But considering all four of L.A.'s wins have come against teams in the NFC East, and their one loss was against the Buffalo Bills (4-0 going into their Tuesday night game), the Rams have yet to answer the question if whether they are a legitimate playoff team.  #4 Teddy Bridgewater Carolina Panthers quarterback Teddy Bridgewater     Carolina Panthers' quarterback Teddy Bridgewater didn't start off hot, but he didn't start off horribly either. Since Week 2, he has shown improvement and considering he was playing against the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, Bridgewater certainly should have blown the secondary away. Bridgewater completed 27 of 37 passes for 313 yards, with two touchdowns and a 116.2 passer rating. The Panthers face the Chicago Bears next Sunday, who are allowing 230.8 passing yards per game.  #3 Ben Roethlisberger Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger The 38-year-old Steelers QB continues to show that injuries and age won't stop him from performing well.     Big Ben has certainly impressed the league so far after some uncertainties over whether he would play football again. He shot the lights out against the struggling Philadelphia Eagles, completing 27 of 34 passes for 239 yards, with 3 touchdowns and a 125.4 passer rating. Considering the Steelers' schedule, a real test will come next week when they play their division rival Cleveland Browns. In some ways, the 4-0 #Steelers are positioned to handle an upcoming schedule that will increase in degree of difficulty, but in other ways there is important work to do.https://t.co/4Jm16VMYpJ— Bob Labriola (@BobLabriola) October 12, 2020 #2 Derek Carr Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr     In probably the biggest upset of the season so far, the Las Vegas Raiders were able to top the red-hot defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, and the quarterback was a big reason. Carr completed 22 of 31 passes for 347 yards, with 3 touchdowns, one interception and a 126.7 passer rating. His best throw went to rookie receiver Henry Ruggs III, who got his first career touchdown on Sunday. Hey. You.Yes, you.Here's @__RUGGS's first career TD that everybody is talking about. #RaiderNation#LVvsKC is on CBS. pic.twitter.com/eq7pP9BUly— Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) October 11, 2020 It's safe to say that the Raiders are an underrated team and teams who will face them in the future should look out for Carr and the rest of the company.      #1 Ryan Fitzpatrick Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick Coming in at No. 1, this is not only a surprise for everyone but for myself as well. The Dolphins' big upset over the 49ers was something the league was talking about, and it was all thanks to one man. Ryan Fitzpatrick completed 22 of 28 passes for 350 yards, with 3 touchdowns and a 154.5 passer rating. That's a nearly perfect rating. Could the Dolphins be a threat to win the AFC East and make a playoff run? They have lost to the Bills, New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks so far. These teams are all off to good starts, and considering how banged up the 49ers are, it could have been a one-off game for Miami. Either way, it is something for fans to keep an eye on.

Rams were on the clock with the first overall pick. The then Rams director of college scouting Brad Holmes fell in love with California quarterback Jared Goff. Holmes pounded the table so hard that he left GM Les Snead no option but to draft Goff.        Fast forward to January 2021, and Brad Holmes is the new GM of the Detroit Lions. And in his first move as GM, Holmes dealt Matthew Stafford to the Rams for two first-round picks and Jared Goff.           Plenty of pundits expect year one to be a tricky year for Goff. Therefore, year one would get classed as a mulligan for Goff. Instead, in Thursday\'s press conference, Brad Holmes firmly put the pressure on Goff: ""So Jared is a very accurate quarterback, and he has receivers that are getting open. I think it\'s been easy to evaluate Jared."" That\'s correct; the man who fought vehemently for Jared Goff is now telling him that the pressure is on. Despite his healthy relationship with the GM, Goff is in the spotlight. #Lions have acquired QB Jared Goff and undisclosed draft selections from the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for QB Matthew Stafford.📰 https://t.co/DvO7cltnjR pic.twitter.com/8aXvkWuuSi— Detroit Lions (@Lions) March 18, 2021     Jared Goff must perform. Due to the Lions\' beefy draft capital, every draft analyst will link the Lions to a quarterback. It would have been easy if Holmes had said year one, the pressure is off Goff, and he\'s the guy. Holmes chose not to. That speaks volumes about the quarterback situation. The ball is firmly in Goff\'s court. At the end of the season meetings, Holmes won\'t make concessions when discussing Goff\'s performance. At 27-years years old, Goff isn\'t old - he should be entering the prime years of his career. Instead, he arrives in Detroit as an outcast. Sean McVay no longer wanted Goff on his team. After a joyous Super Bowl run, Goff\'s play declined to an alarming level. The interceptions and bad decisions became more prominent in his game. That became untenable, and the team that gave up so much to draft him and then paid him a boatload quit on him.     History is not on Goff\'s side. Recently, NFL teams have used young quarterbacks on rookie deals as a ticket for success. Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, and Carson Wentz enjoyed great success on rookie contracts. Despite restructuring Goff\'s contract, it is still a bloated deal for a player deemed damaged goods. There is always a good crop of young collegiate quarterbacks coming through for the 2022 NFL Draft. That complicates the situation for Goff. Dan Campbell spoke about biding his time for a quarterback in the offseason. The new head coach spoke glowingly about how the Chiefs waited for the right player at quarterback. The Lions won\'t worry about the cap concerns. The salary cap is set for an increase once the new NFL TV deal kicks in. Teams are no longer concerned about carrying dead cap money. It muddies the situation for Goff even more. After sweating on the decision to draft Jared Goff in 2016, the new GM has firmly put pressure on Goff. He expects quality quarterback play. Holmes wants Goff to step up and command the Lions locker room.     Sportspeople often hit crossroads in their respective careers. Jared Goff is at a massive crossroads. His career in the NFL as a starting quarterback is on the line. His most trusted confidant is not going to make excuses for him - no one else will. The unassuming Californian needs to go out roaring like a Lion in 2021. Otherwise, his stayover in Detroit might resemble a pit stop.The Jared Goff restructure is officially on the books, and the NFLPA public salary cap report now has the Lions with approximately $22.4 million in available cap space. pic.twitter.com/73AVMNEOHv— Chris Burke (@ChrisBurkeNFL) April 1, 2021Also Read: Who is Jared Goff\'s Girlfriend, Christen Harper?

The Lions certainly hope he does and given the pedigree, it's quite possible. The defensive end is poised to terrorize opposing quarterbacks for years to come in the NFC North.  Right now, he hasn't done anything in the NFL as training camp is barely underway, but he's already made an impression on his teammates.

Fortunately, this happened pretty early in the training camp, so the relationships can continue to grow from there. Also Checkout:- Lions Preseason Schedule  Are the Detroit Lions ready to contend? Green Bay Packers v Detroit Lions     If there was ever any doubt about how rough the Lions have had it, look no further than the 2021 NFL season. For the first time in ages, Matthew Stafford was not the starting quarterback. He was traded to the Los Angeles Rams for a host of picks and Jared Goff. The latter came in ready to start over away from Los Angeles, but it did not go particularly well. It took him 11 games to win the first game of his entire career in which Sean McVay wasn't his coach. On the other side, the quarterback who had languished in Detroit won a Super Bowl in his first season elsewhere.        Those two things are a solid indicator that it's bad in Detroit. However, they are on the upswing now, it seems. With Hutchinson in tow, the defense should improve. The problems on the offense, even with a struggling Goff, shouldn't be as bad as it was. D'Andre Swift, TJ Hockenson, and Amon-Ra St. Brown are a strong trio of offensive weapons. The addition of DJ Chark and Jameson Williams should open up the field for them a little bit more.   Ultimately, they won't be as bad as they were last year, but they won't contend. They're still the worst team in their division and the other three didn't get much worse. They're probably still a couple of years away at this point.     "", ""5 NFL players undeserving of their current contracts ft. OBJ  All NFL players earn wages that differ in amount.

NFL players underperforming their current contract        #1 - WR Odell Beckham Jr., Cleveland Browns ($95M)           When Odell Beckham Jr. was still with the New York Giants, he was one of the best NFL players. His play-making abilities from the wide receiver position made him a huge threat to defenses. Unfortunately, he has not been the same since the 2016 season. He has battled through injuries and has only had decent performances, but not as well as he's been paid. He has just 200 yards and no touchdowns this year.

He signed a monstrous contract with the Philadelphia Eagles before being traded to the Indianapolis Colts. Wentz threw 15 interceptions in a disappointing 2020 season. He hasn't turned the situation around yet and has shown a worrying regression in performance.  #3 - QB Jared Goff, Detroit Lions ($134M) Jared Goff is another of the highest paid NFL players. He helped lead the Los Angeles Rams to a Super Bowl appearance, but he seems to be more of a game manager than anything else. He never won a game without Sean McVay as his head coach. Goff was winless with the Rams when Jeff Fisher was still the head coach and he is now winless so far with his new team, the Detroit Lions. NFL on CBS 🏈@NFLonCBSOn Sunday, Jared Goff will visit the Rams for a showdown with his old team. Goff is 42-20 with Sean McVay as his head coach.

He's 0-13 with everyone else. https://t.co/mEpNPzYkuC     #4 - LB C.J. Mosley, New York Jets ($85M) C.J. Mosley was one of the best defensive NFL players when he played for the Baltimore Ravens. The New York Jets signed him to a massive contract to be the centerpiece in their defense. Mosley missed almost the entire 2019 season with an injury and opted out of 2020 for COVID-related reasons. He is one of the most talented NFL players to not live up to his contract yet. #5 - S Landon Collins, Washington Football Team ($84M) Landon Collins became one of the most overpaid NFL players as soon as he signed his contract. Safety is not a premium position that demands high contracts, with the exception of very special NFL players. Collins was never exceptional even before he signed. He had one good season but earned a payslip similar to the top NFL defensive players. He was the highest paid safety in the NFL when he signed.     "", ""Fantasy Football Start 'Em Sit 'Em 2022 NFL Week 9: Quarterback rankings  In Fantasy Football, it is important to solidify the quarterback position each week of every season, and Week 9 of the 2022 NFL season will prove to be one of the trickiest to do so. Six teams will be on a bye week, the most of any week this year, and gives fantasy managers fewer options to work with.  Managers should always pay attention to specific matchups. This will be even more crucial in Week 9 when analyzing replacements and streamers. Recent performances will play a factor when deciding which quarterbacks to target, as well as the strength of their opponent's passing defense.        Week 9 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks: Start 'Em           #1 Aaron Rodgers - Green Bay Packers vs. Detroit Lions Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers Aaron Rodgers has been relatively disappointing during the 2022 NFL season. The reigning back-to-back NFL MVP winner currently ranks just 17th among quarterbacks in total Fantasy Football points this year and has also failed to finish better than QB12 in any week so far this season. He will get into an ideal situation to break out in a big way in Week 9 when the Green Bay Packers face off against the Detroit Lions. The Lions are the only team in the NFL allowing more than 30 points per game this year. They also allow the second-most fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks.     #2 Justin Fields - Chicago Bears vs. Miami Dolphins Chicago Bears QB Justin Fields Justin Fields ranks within the top 12 among quarterbacks in total Fantasy Football points this year, making him a legitimate starter in favorable matchups. He will get one in Week 9 as the Miami Dolphins are one of only seven teams allowing more than 20 fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks.         Fields has really been heating up in recent weeks due to his rushing contributions in the game. He has exceeded 45 rushing yards in each of his last six games, while also adding three rushing touchdowns. He will also get an offensive boost after the Chicago Bears acquired Chase Claypool at the NFL trade deadline. #3 Trevor Lawrence - Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Las Vegas Raiders Jacksonville Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence Trevor Lawrence has had an excellent 2022 Fantasy Football season. He finished within the top 12 in fantasy points among quarterbacks in four weeks this year, including two top-five finishes.     Lawrence has a chance to once again finish among the top quarterbacks in Week 9 against the Las Vegas Raiders. They have been the most favorable defense for quarterbacks, allowing the most fantasy points per game so far. #4 Derek Carr - Las Vegas Raiders vs, Jacksonville Jaguars Las Vegas Raiders QB Derek Carr Derek Carr has been one of the most disappointing quarterbacks during the 2022 Fantasy Football season. He entered the year with high expectations after the Las Vegas Raiders acquired Davante Adams during the offseason.     Carr finished in the top 20 in fantasy points among quarterbacks in every season of his career, while setting a new career high in total fantasy points last year. He has regressed despite adding Adams, but currently ranks as QB22 and can't be trusted in Fantasy Football regardless of match up. #5 Matthew Stafford - Los Angeles Rams vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Los Angeles Rams QB Matthew Stafford Speaking of disappointments during the 2022 Fantasy Football season, Matthew Stafford has been even more of a let down. He finished the 2021 season as a top-five quarterback, but ranks as the QB24 this year.     While Cooper Kupp continues to be one of the best wide receivers in the NFL, Stafford has severely struggled this season. A challenging matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defense is an unlikely scenario for a breakout game. #6 Jared Goff - Detroit Lions vs. Green Bay Packers Detroit Lions QB Jared Goff Jared Goff has been a popular streaming quarterback this season. He can put huge point totals in the right matchup, but has alarming bust potential in the wrong one. This was demonstrated by the top-ten finishes in the weeks he played against the Washington Commanders and Seattle Seahawks, but bottom-five finishes when facing off against the Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots.         Goff should be avoided in Fantasy Football in Week 9. The Green Bay Packers currently allow the second-fewest fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks.

The 31-30 loss means the Lions are now 3-7 this season and in last place in the NFC North.  Both teams came into Sunday's game with an evenly-matched regular record.        The game was even for most of the first half. Both teams had field goals that left them tied for three points apiece at the end of the first quarter. In the second quarter, both teams scored a touchdown to bring the half-time score to 10-10.            Jared Goff threw a passing touchdown to Brock Wright after the Lions took a risk on 4th-and-goal. However, the Bears pulled level with a magnificent rushing touchdown by Justin Fields, which was the highlight of the half. The second half saw the Chicago Bears coming out strong. The defense stopped the Detroit Lions in their tracks. On the next drive, Fields connected for a touchdown pass to Cole Kmet. That gave them a 17-10 lead. Justin Fields also completed four consecutive games with, at least, one rushing and one passing touchdown with that pass.  When they got the ball next, the Bears extended their lead to 24-10 after a 50-yard touchdown pass from Fields to Kmet. The third quarter got even better when the Bears defense sacked Jared Goff in the last minute.     The fourth quarter saw some bad defensive plays by the Bears as they gave away penalties and failed to stop D'Andre Swift's run to the end zone to bring the game to 24-17. On the next play, disaster struck for Justin Fields as he threw an interception on 2nd-and-18. Cornerback Jeff Okudah ran into the end zone to make it 24-24.  But if Fields was at fault for that, then he more than made up for it on the next drive. On a 3rd-and-2 at their 30-yard line, he took off and ran for a 67-yard rushing touchdown. The conversion was missed, meaning the Bears were up 30-24. Billy Heyen@BillyHeyenJustin Fields 67-yard rushing touchdown 71Justin Fields 67-yard rushing touchdown 😳 https://t.co/IO3q73OTTS     The next drives stalled, but when the Lions got the ball back, they made it count by setting up a long drive down field with Jamaal Williams scoring a rushing touchdown. The conversion gave them a 31-30 lead that they never relinquished. How good has Justin Fields been over the last few weeks? Anyone who saw Justin Fields on Sunday saw a team losing despite their quarterback and not because of him. It has been a similar story for the last three weeks. His current run of, at least, one rushing and one passing touchdown in four straight games is tied for the second-longest in NFL history.  In his last three losses, his quarterback rating was 120.0 against Dallas, 106.7 against Miami and 99.4 today. He has seven passing touchdowns and four rushing touchdowns in his last three games, with the only interception coming on Sunday. Yet he has lost all three games.     Sportskeeda Pro Football@SKProFootballFor the second straight week, Justin Fields did everything with his legs and arm, and the Bears lost another close game...🦁 #DETvsCHI#OnePride #DaBears8For the second straight week, Justin Fields did everything with his legs and arm, and the Bears lost another close game...🦁 🐻#DETvsCHI#OnePride #DaBears https://t.co/B4UgWThif2 The defense has given up more than 30 points in each of their last three games. They need to tighten up to give them a chance at converting wins into losses. Fields has also been sacked nine times in the last three games, pointing to a need for the offensive line to toughen up and the wide receivers to get open faster. Fields has been nothing but exemplary in recent weeks, but he is not getting much support. The Bears will have to do better, and soon.     "", ""Fantasy Football Start 'Em Sit 'Em 2022 NFL Week 18: Quarterback rankings  The quarterbacks are the highest-scoring players in Fantasy Football. Managers with a fantasy matchup in Week 18 of the 2022 NFL season are likely well aware of this. Any fantasy leagues still playing matchups in Week 18 are surely hosting their championship game. Teams who have made it this far know the importance of optimizing their quarterback position.  Week 18 presents a unique challenge for Fantasy Football, as many NFL teams will be resting some of their starters in some form or another. Teams with nothing left to play for this year may want to give some of their backups a look, while star players on playoff teams that can't improve their seed may choose to rest this week.         This severely affects which quarterbacks to target when setting fantasy lineups.            NFL Week 18 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks: Start 'Em Aaron Rodgers - Green Bay Packers vs. Detroit Lions Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers Aaron Rodgers needs just one more win to clinch a playoff spot for the Green Bay Packers. He gets that opportunity against Jared Goff and the Detroit Lions. The 39-year-old will also be looking to rebound from a three-interception performance when he faced them in Week 9.      The Lions allow the most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks and the game will be played at Lambeau Field. Rodgers is trending towards a big game in Fantasy Football.      Trevor Lawrence - Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Tennessee Titans Jacksonville Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence     Trevor Lawrence has been one of the hottest quarterbacks in recent weeks, finishing among the top ten quarterbacks five times in his last seven games. This included a top-five finish against two solid defenses, the Dallas Cowboys and Baltimore Ravens.  The last time he faced off against the Tennessee Titans, he finished as QB1. He gets to play them again in Week 18 in a winner-take-all game for the AFC South division title.  Dak Prescott - Dallas Cowboys vs. Washington Commanders Dallas Cowboys QB Dak Prescott     Dak Prescott must lead the Dallas Cowboys to victory in Week 18 to keep their hopes alive for an NFC East division title. He will get that opportunity against the Washington Commanders, who have been eliminated from playoff contention.  They will turn to third-string rookie quarterback Sam Howell to replace Carson Wentz and Taylor Heinicke. The Commanders will likely struggle to move the ball with their backups, giving Prescott plenty of scoring opportunities in Fantasy Football. NFL Week 18 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks: Sit 'Em      Baker Mayfield - Los Angeles Rams vs. Seattle Seahawks Los Angeles Rams QB Baker Mayfield While Baker Mayfield has done a relatively solid job filling in for Matthew Stafford as he recovers from injuries, he is still yet to make much of an impact in Fantasy Football. He has failed to record better than a QB12 finish this year. He can be avoided in Week 18 in a difficult road matchup against the Seattle Seahawks, who are in a must-win situation for their playoff hopes.     Russell Wilson - Denver Broncos vs. Los Angeles Chargers Denver Broncos QB Russell Wilson Russell Wilson has recorded two of his three best Fantasy Football performances this year in the last three weeks. Both were against the Kansas City Chiefs in shootouts with Patrick Mahomes. Week 18 is a much different situation against the Los Angeles Chargers. The last time he faced off against them, he was held to fewer than 200 yards and just one touchdown.         Tyler Huntley - Baltimore Ravens vs. Cincinnati Bengals Baltimore Ravens QB Tyler Huntley Tyler Huntley possesses similar rushing upside to Lamar Jackson, but obviously on a much smaller scale. The bigger issue with Huntley is his passing, as he's failed to reach 200 yards in any of his five games this year. He enters a challenging matchup in Week 18 against the Cincinnati Bengals. They allow the third fewest fantasy points per game to quarterbacks.

They will be more important than ever during Week 14 of the 2022 NFL season.   A maximum of six NFL teams are on a bye week, significantly decreasing the pool of available options. Week 14 is also the last week before the fantasy playoffs begin in most leagues.        The heightened importance of Week 14 makes it crucial for fantasy managers to solidify their quarterback positions. They are often the highest-scoring players in Fantasy Football.            Their scores can be the direct difference between winning and losing. Analyzing each quarterback's situation in Week 14 of the 2022 Fantasy Football season will give managers certain options to target and others to avoid.

He has finished inside the top 12 quarterbacks seven times this year, out of which five were inside the top eight.  He has a great chance to keep things going against the Tennessee Titans. They allow the third-most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks. Kirk Cousins - Minnesota Vikings vs. Detroit Lions Minnesota Vikings QB Kirk Cousins The Detroit Lions have been the most favorable matchup in the 2022 Fantasy Football season for opposing players. They allow the most fantasy points to several positions, including quarterbacks.      Kirk Cousins appears to be in line for a big game in Week 14 and will continue his strong season. He ranks inside the top 15 fantasy quarterbacks so far.     Jared Goff - Detroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings Detroit Lions QB Jared Goff     Jared Goff has been a boom-or-bust quarterback for much of the 2022 Fantasy Football season. He has finished inside the top 10 quarterbacks three times, but also outside the top 25 quarterbacks four times.

He last played during the 2020 season, when he led the NFL in passing.  Watson struggled in his first game back, recording just 131 passing yards and an interception.

Minnesota will pay Cousins $40 million for the 2022 NFL season, which will likely be his last with the team. The amount of time and money the Vikings have invested in Cousins hasn\'t paid dividends, but he can still prove everyone wrong if he leads them to a Super Bowl win this season.     ', ""Kirk Cousins: NFL fans roast Kirk Cousins after Vikings' brutal 40-3 loss to Cowboys  By the time their game against the Dallas Cowboys was over, Kirk Cousins and the Minnesota Vikings had come crashing down to earth. They entered the game with an 8-1 record, fighting for the top seed in the NFC with the Philadelphia Eagles, who had an identical win-loss ratio.   They had defeated the much-fancied Buffalo Bills the previous week and there was talk about the Vikings quarterback leading them all the way to the Super Bowl.        As it turned out, they slipped back in relation to the Eagles as they lost and Philadelphia beat the Indianapolis Colts. The Vikings fell to 8-2, while the Eagles are now 9-1.            But more than the ground they lost in that race, it was the chastening nature of the defeat that should worry Vikings fans the most. Losing 40-3 to the Cowboys, they had a bad day all over the field. On defense, they gave up 40 points, which is never easy for an offense to counter. The offense, led by Kirk Cousins, had an awful day as they could not score a single touchdown. If it wasn't for Dalvin Cook, who had 11 rushing attempts for 72 yards, they would not have had a sniff of scoring even a single point.  Cousins was pressured throughout the game and gave up seven sacks for a loss of 49 yards. It was such a bad performance that by the end of the game, he was pulled and backup Nick Mullens took over quarterback duties.     NFL fans were equally less forgiving toward the Vikings quarterback. They roasted his performance across the Twitterverse.

"", 'Shannon Sharpe blasts Kirk Cousins over yet another Vikings meltdown  Kirk Cousins entered Week 17 of the 2022 NFL season in a key matchup for the outlook of the NFL Playoffs. When the Minnesota Vikings and Green Bay Packers faced off in a high-stakes matchup, serious postseason implications were on the line for both teams. The Vikings are still battling for the number one overall seed in the NFC, while the Packers are trying to earn a Wild Card spot.  Cousins has built a bit of an unfortunate reputation during his career of being a quarterback who often plays his worst brand of football in the biggest moments of the year. This is an accurate description of his performance in Week 17. The Vikings were blown out 41-17, while Kirk Cousins threw three interceptions. He also failed to record a touchdown until the fourth quarter of the game.        Shannon Sharpe recently discussed the poor performance during an episode of Undisputed, saying:           ""I just don\'t have the utmost confidence in Cousins. Because I see a guy that\'s an overachiever, that\'s underconfident. And so you see how Green Bay started to attack him. And so now Jefferson is getting more frustrated, because I\'m not getting the ball. I\'ve gone a whole quarter and I ain\'t got one target. So now they know, and Jaire knows, I got it now. He\'s frustrated. And so even when the ball comes his way, he\'s so focused on beating me, that now he loses concentration.""         Sharpe shredded Kirk Cousins for his disappointing outing in yet another big spot. He also heavily blamed Cousins for his failure to involve Justin Jefferson in the offense, despite being covered by Jaire Alexander. Jefferson was targeted just five times, recording one reception for 15 yards.   Kirk Cousins\' failure to target Justin Jefferson largely contributes to Vikings\' Week 17 loss to Packers Kirk Cousins and Justin Jefferson     Justin Jefferson has recorded 124 receptions on 179 targets for 1,771 yards during the 2022 NFL season. He leads the entire league in all three categories. It\'s inexcusable that Kirk Cousins failed to get him more involved in Week 17. While Jaire Alexander is one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL, the Vikings\' offense is elite when Jefferson plays a major role.     In three of the Vikings\' four losses this year, Jefferson has recorded fewer than 50 receiving yards. They also have an impressive 9-1 record when he accounts for more than six receptions. There is a direct correlation between his production and the Vikings\' results in games this year.     Justin Jefferson can only perform when the quarterback throws him the ball. A huge part of the blame for his disappearance in Week 17 needs to be on Kirk Cousins. It\'s a major factor as to why they were blown away by the Packers.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Undisputed and H/T Sportskeeda.     ', 'NFL fans react to Mike Zimmer Kirk Cousins  Former Minnesota Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer coached the team from 2014 until the end of the 2021/22 season. During his eight-year run with the Vikings, he\'s won the NFC North twice and made the playoffs in 2019 as a wild card team.  In the latter part of his stint, the team seemed unstable as there was little consistency in their performance. Much of it seemed connected to the HC\'s relationship with his quarterbacks. Former Minnesota Vikings linebacker Ben Leber spoke about Zimmer\'s relationship with current Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins.        Leber said that Zimmer disliked Cousins and it showed. He recently told Zach Gelb of CBS Sports Radio:           “I think he’s gonna finally thrive, really thrive, in a system and a coach that actually respects him. I mean, it’s not like I’m not breaking news here that Mike Zimmer did not like Kirk Cousins. And I think that showed in the way that Kirk behaved and the way that he carried himself. The team was never given to him, or he was never allowed to earn the trust of the team, because the head coach I think just didn’t like him.” Leber added that it\'s tough for Cousins to win alongside the substandard defense that they\'ve had for the past two years.     He added: “That was a top-10 offense last year, with a very green, first-time offensive coordinator [Klint Kubiak]. Where was their defense ranked last year? Thirty-first. The year before that, I think they were ranked 27th. So people can rail on Kirk and rail on this offense and say we can’t win with him or we can’t win with this offense. I say that’s total BS. We couldn’t win with the crap defense that we’ve had the last two years."" He elaborated on the poor quality of Minnesota\'s defense: ""We couldn’t stop the run, at all - ever. And then in key moments of the games, we couldn’t stop any two-minute offense. So, to me, the biggest liability of this team has been defense. All this team has to do is play good team defense, finish in the mid-teens at the end of the season, and they’re playoff bound and they can make some noise.”     ProFootballTalk@ProFootballTalkSays former Vikings LB (and current Vikings radio analyst) @nacholeber to @ZachGelb: Mike Zimmer didn\'t like Kirk Cousins, and it showed.

Who should start: Taylor Heinicke or Carson Wentz? There's no denying that Wentz has talent. His 2017 season was incredible and he has shown flashes of brilliance ever since. The biggest issue with him is inconsistency. Washington Commanders v Philadelphia Eagles Sometimes, he makes tremendous throws and incredibly athletic plays. He sometimes throws the ball directly at defenders too. Wentz can show why he was selected second overall in one play and then follow it up with a huge mistake.        His backup doesn't seem to have the highs and lows that Wentz does. He may not be capable of making some of the plays that Wentz is, but he's also not going to make as many errors, either. Commanders head coach Ron Rivera has thrown Wentz under the bus once before this season. He will have a decision to make in the near future.   The Commanders have played fairly well with their backup, but he's the backup for a reason. It will be interesting to see where they are in the standings when Wentz returns and who they decide to start then on. If Taylor Heinicke continues to win games, there's a good chance he will get the nod.     ""]"

""This defense"" refers to the unit\'s performance on Saturday in a dominant 13-3 victory over the Baltimore Ravens.  Tyler Huntley was in at quarterback for the Ravens and was harassed all day, taking three sacks and plenty of hits in snowy conditions in Cleveland. On a day when the offense only mustered 13 points, the defense saved the day.        Yet the win only pushed the team to a 6-8 record and time is running out in the playoff race. Unfortunately, things are clicking in this season way too late.           The Browns defense has too many regrets in 2022 Baltimore Ravens v Cleveland Browns The plan heading into 2022 was to hover around the .500 mark until Deshaun Watson could return. That meant the defense was set to play a big role if the team was going to make the postseason. Instead, they allowed 30 points or more in five games, including a disastrous Week 2 collapse against the New York Jets.     Cleveland Browns@BrownsJORDAN GOT : #BALvsCLE on NFLN: Stream on NFL+19824JORDAN GOT 🆙📺: #BALvsCLE on NFLN📱: Stream on NFL+ https://t.co/uyjBamK0GI Fans have been calling for the team to fire defensive coordinator Joe Woods for weeks, only for his group to finally come alive about a week before Christmas. A win to get to 6-8 does keep slim playoff hopes alive, but more than anything, the team is seeking positives heading into 2023. Players and coaches alike are fighting for their jobs and holding a Ravens team to three points is impressive, even when considering the fact Lamar Jackson was out.     The key now is to keep up this performance next week against a New Orleans Saints team without a solid option at quarterback. This defense has too much talent to falter against subpar talent in the quarterback position. The Browns are a team that will be led by Watson for years to come. It appears his presence has given the defense a boost as well. Whether that carries over into the next three games remains to be seen. If it does, the defense can put the early-season woes behind it and focus on a new identity in 2023. Cleveland Browns@BrownsTook care of business. Next up, Christmas Eve game!@deshaunwatson | #Browns20224Took care of business. Next up, Christmas Eve game!@deshaunwatson | #Browns https://t.co/eJb6W5S0pu The front office in Cleveland must also avoid getting too caught up in game-to-game performances, instead focusing on the season as a whole. That means changes will surely come in 2023, with a focus on plugging holes throughout the unit. While the Ravens only scored three points, J.K. Dobbins ran all over the Browns with 125 yards on 13 carries. That number should be seen as a massive concern once the thrill of the victory wears off.     ', 'Josh Allen Pro Bowl 2023: Why is Bills QB being replaced by Tyler Huntley?  Josh Allen had to withdraw from the Pro Bowl due to an injury. This is not an uncommon occurrence as the NFL season can be draining and many players have outstanding injuries at the end of it all. Many of them are not worth risking over a Pro Bowl appearance.  What is an uncommon occurrence is a player of Allen\'s caliber being replaced by a backup. Most years, the next most-deserving player will be called upon to replace the injured party.        This time, the NFL is adding Baltimore Ravens backup quarterback Tyler Huntley to the roster in Allen\'s stead. This is largely due to the fact that Huntley, despite starting just four regular-season games, got an incredible amount of fan votes.           Allen is having to back out due to an elbow injury he\'s been dealing with since Week 9 of the regular season.    Per Bleacher Report, Josh Allen said: ""There was a period obviously right after for a few weeks where it was pretty bothersome. But again it didn\'t affect me all that much. I just kind of felt like maybe I was trying to throw it a little differently mechanically, had to change a few things and got away a little bit from how I\'m used to throwing the ball.""     Allen reiterated that rest and recovery and not surgery was all he needed. As a result, he won\'t be in the Pro Bowl and Huntley will take his place. Josh Allen will need to rest his arm While he was able to play through it, his play did suffer a bit. The Bills and Allen faltered a bit down the stretch and were blown out by the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Divisional Round. The pre-season MVP favorite will hope to recover and return next year better than ever.      Tyler Huntley stats: How did Ravens backup replace Josh Allen? Over the NFL season, several backups came in and delivered excellent performances for their teams. Gardner Minshew had a good game in relief of Jalen Hurts. The Carolina Panthers used a rotating door of backups and several of them played well. The Los Angeles Rams got a comeback win from Baker Mayfield two days after signing him as a backup.  Huntley did exactly that and more. He threw for 658 yards and two touchdowns (three interceptions) and ran for 137 yards and one touchdown in six games.     ', ""3 reasons why the Ravens and Cowboys need CJ Beathard  CJ Beathard is currently playing for his career in Florida. North of his position, the Ravens are at Defcon One at backup quarterback. West of his position, the Cowboys are drawing straws at backup quarterback.  Both teams currently do not have a solution for the position. Tyler Huntley, a third-string quarterback, is the Ravens' current backup. Meanwhile, the Cowboys can't pick from three third-string quarterbacks, which makes CJ Beathard a great fit for both teams.         Here's why both teams should be competing to get the quarterback this summer.            #1 CJ Beathard's Week-Two performance For those who made it to the end of the Monday Night Football broadcast, they were rewarded with an offensive explosion. CJ Beathard came into the game down multiple possessions, and ended the game with a two-point deficit. Beathard went nine for 14, and threw for 121 yards and two touchdowns in about half a quarter. Jaguars QB Competition Update:CJ Beathard: 13/16, 102 yds, 1 TD, 0 sacksTrevor Lawrence: 6/9, 71 yds, 0 TD, 2 sacksNumbers don't lie #Hawkeyes pic.twitter.com/GlCtdxFQmc— Barstool Hawkeyes (@BarstoolUIowa) August 22, 2021 Before Beathard, the Jaguars had scored three points. Beathard helped the Jaguars score 18 points in the fourth quarter. No backup Ravens or Cowboys quarterback has been able to come anywhere close to that type of performance.      #2 CJ Beathard's experience While the Cowboys and Ravens' backups have all barely seen the field during the regular season, CJ Beathard has started 12 games in the NFL.  Any NFL experience is good experience. The more experience a quarterback has, the more comfortable they are while running an NFL offense in the heat of the game and the higher the chances of a good output from the team.     12 games of experience is a massive gap early in a player's career. 12 games is almost a full rookie season. Basically, CJ Beathard has already almost completed a rookie season in the NFL. It could take the Ravens and Cowboys' backups years to get this number of starts as a backup. However, with Beathard, the growing pains are largely done.      #3 CJ Beathard has been on the up Jacksonville Jaguars Training Camp CJ Beathard admittedly started slow early in his career. He was 1-9 in his first ten games. However, since then, he has been on the up, going 1-1. 2020 saw him throw for six touchdowns and zero interceptions. It is unclear what lit the fire under Beathard.That said, after his Week Two performance on Monday Night Football and his 2020 stats, CJ Beathard looks like a ship poised for takeoff. If the Cowboys or Ravens do land him, they might be surprised with what they got.     "", '""Getting Back in the Lab Flock WTF"" - Lamar Jackson critical of his own performance against Cleveland Browns  Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson returned to action during Sunday night after missing last week\'s road game against the Chicago Bears due to an illness.  The Ravens\' primetime game against the Cleveland Browns was bizarre at points with constant turnovers for both teams. Lamar Jackson threw three interceptions in just the second quarter, and Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield wasn\'t much better either.        After the game, quarterback Lamar Jackson tweeted that he was going to be \'getting back in the lab\' in reference to his performance on Sunday night.

Lamar Jackson tweets his determination to improve his game Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson started off the season as a darkhorse for NFL MVP consideration. Jackson\'s struggles seemed to begin in Week 10 on Thursday night against the Miami Dolphins. He had just a 60 percent completion and threw for 238 yards with a touchdown and an interception.     Jackson missed the Week 11 roadtrip to Soldier Field due to an illness he had been dealing with all week. The Ravens did squeak out a win with backup quarterback Tyler Huntley. Jackson practiced all week and took the field on Sunday night for the first of two meetings in a three-week span against the Cleveland Browns. In the second quarter alone, Jackson threw three interceptions. He ended the game with a total of four and threw for just 165 passing yards and one touchdown; he rushed for an additional 68 yards.

In his tweet, Lamar Jackson also used hashtags to say it was a great team win and to praise the defensive performance. Acknowledging that although he and the offense had their struggles, the team came together to get the divisional win. Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens are now going to have to get back on the drawing board to find another way to get the ball up and down the field and prevent a repeat of the turnovers that happened last night. Lamar Jackson has thrown 12 interceptions through ten games this season, a career-high for the 24-year-old. Jackson had 18 interceptions in his first three seasons combined before the start of the current season.The Ravens must now get ready for a road game against the Pittsburgh Steelers this weekend. While the Steelers\' struggles are immense right now, their defense can force turnovers, which is something that Jackson and the Ravens will have to figure out.

To the best of their abilities, officials must locate the ball. When judgments are not precise, particularly when a survey alters the result of a game, it adds a significant amount of human imperfection to the sport and frequently causes dissatisfaction. Football fans had issues with the manner football officials spot balls in the league. In spite of how the officials try their best to position themselves optimally, spotting the ball frequently relies on the officials' visual inspection. But there has been a mechanical method for measuring precisely for who knows how long.     What other devices does the NFL use?

"", ""Fantasy Football Start 'Em Sit 'Em 2022 NFL Week 18: Quarterback rankings  The quarterbacks are the highest-scoring players in Fantasy Football. Managers with a fantasy matchup in Week 18 of the 2022 NFL season are likely well aware of this. Any fantasy leagues still playing matchups in Week 18 are surely hosting their championship game. Teams who have made it this far know the importance of optimizing their quarterback position.  Week 18 presents a unique challenge for Fantasy Football, as many NFL teams will be resting some of their starters in some form or another. Teams with nothing left to play for this year may want to give some of their backups a look, while star players on playoff teams that can't improve their seed may choose to rest this week.         This severely affects which quarterbacks to target when setting fantasy lineups.            NFL Week 18 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks: Start 'Em Aaron Rodgers - Green Bay Packers vs. Detroit Lions Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers Aaron Rodgers needs just one more win to clinch a playoff spot for the Green Bay Packers. He gets that opportunity against Jared Goff and the Detroit Lions. The 39-year-old will also be looking to rebound from a three-interception performance when he faced them in Week 9.      The Lions allow the most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks and the game will be played at Lambeau Field. Rodgers is trending towards a big game in Fantasy Football.      Trevor Lawrence - Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Tennessee Titans Jacksonville Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence     Trevor Lawrence has been one of the hottest quarterbacks in recent weeks, finishing among the top ten quarterbacks five times in his last seven games. This included a top-five finish against two solid defenses, the Dallas Cowboys and Baltimore Ravens.  The last time he faced off against the Tennessee Titans, he finished as QB1. He gets to play them again in Week 18 in a winner-take-all game for the AFC South division title.  Dak Prescott - Dallas Cowboys vs. Washington Commanders Dallas Cowboys QB Dak Prescott     Dak Prescott must lead the Dallas Cowboys to victory in Week 18 to keep their hopes alive for an NFC East division title. He will get that opportunity against the Washington Commanders, who have been eliminated from playoff contention.  They will turn to third-string rookie quarterback Sam Howell to replace Carson Wentz and Taylor Heinicke. The Commanders will likely struggle to move the ball with their backups, giving Prescott plenty of scoring opportunities in Fantasy Football. NFL Week 18 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks: Sit 'Em      Baker Mayfield - Los Angeles Rams vs. Seattle Seahawks Los Angeles Rams QB Baker Mayfield While Baker Mayfield has done a relatively solid job filling in for Matthew Stafford as he recovers from injuries, he is still yet to make much of an impact in Fantasy Football. He has failed to record better than a QB12 finish this year. He can be avoided in Week 18 in a difficult road matchup against the Seattle Seahawks, who are in a must-win situation for their playoff hopes.     Russell Wilson - Denver Broncos vs. Los Angeles Chargers Denver Broncos QB Russell Wilson Russell Wilson has recorded two of his three best Fantasy Football performances this year in the last three weeks. Both were against the Kansas City Chiefs in shootouts with Patrick Mahomes. Week 18 is a much different situation against the Los Angeles Chargers. The last time he faced off against them, he was held to fewer than 200 yards and just one touchdown.         Tyler Huntley - Baltimore Ravens vs. Cincinnati Bengals Baltimore Ravens QB Tyler Huntley Tyler Huntley possesses similar rushing upside to Lamar Jackson, but obviously on a much smaller scale. The bigger issue with Huntley is his passing, as he's failed to reach 200 yards in any of his five games this year. He enters a challenging matchup in Week 18 against the Cincinnati Bengals.

But with everything fans have seen this year, there are a few standout teams that will need all the help they can get if they hope to advance to the divisional round.  There's a common theme among the most likely candidates to go one-and-done this postseason: inconsistent offenses.        Baltimore Ravens           Similar to the Miami Dolphins' quarterback problems and injuries, the Baltimore Ravens have played without Lamar Jackson for what feels like a year, but have only been since Week 13. Tyler Huntley is not the worst option at quarterback, but his recent performances indicate Baltimore has a serious issue under center. Huntley is averaging just over 100 yards passing oer game in his four starts (2-2 record), so his ability to rush for the occasional first down could be an X-factor in this divisional rematch. John Harbaugh's teams always give the effort, but the effort and the execution are not the same, especially in a must-win game. Cincinatti Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow will most likely initiate the scoring in this matchup, and it'll be on the Ravens offense with Huntley to keep up. Tyler Huntley scrambles vs. Pittsburgh     Tampa Bay Buccanners Even with a sub .500 record at 8-9, the Bucs won another AFC South Division title in 2022, giving them at least one home playoff game. Having Tom Brady at quarterback, especially in the playoffs, gives Tampa Bay fans more confidence in their squad. This year has given the Bucs everything but complete confidence, though. At times, it feels like Brady is just throwing slants and out routes, with the rushing attack being close to irrelevant. The offensive line has seen injuries, which is exactly what you don't want with a 45-year-old quarterback. An athletic Dallas Cowboys defense could create some issues for Tampa Bay's offense. And we could very well see one of the last home playoff games for debatably the league's greatest quarterback ever in Tom Brady. Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill     Miami Dolphins At one point this NFL season, it wouldn't be crazy to think the Miami Dolphins would make it to the AFC divisional round, maybe even host a playoff game. However, after Tua Tagovailoa's first concussion in Week 5 against the Bengals, this offense has been extremely inconsistent. If not for an unimpressive 11-6 win last week against a Joe Flacco-led Jets team, Miami would still be at home. A record of 9-8 gives the Dolphins a playoff berth and a very tough test at Buffalo for this team in their matchup in the wild-card round. The Dolphins have seemed to become less and less of a threat as the year progressed.

The Colts\' 26-11 loss to the Jaguars was one of the worst losses in franchise history. Although Wentz played a patricularly poor game, the entire team failed to perform adequately. Seeing Luck at Lucas Oil Stadium was likely hard for Colts fans. They were happy to see him looking healthy and happy. They couldn\'t help but wonder how things would\'ve turned out differently if the three-time Pro Bowler was still the quarterback, however.

Seeing Luck on the national stage was a treat for football fans everywhere. During Luck\'s time at Standford, he was one of the most highly-touted college prospects in history. He received comparisons to the likes of Peyton Manning as a ""can\'t miss prospect.""Luck may have only played six seasons in the NFL, but he left a memorable impression on many during his time in the league. He holds a career record of 53-33, throwing 171 touchdowns and passing for 23,671 yards in just 86 appearances.     ', '""He\'s the best prospect"" - Former Stanford coach draws parallels between Andrew Luck, USC QB Caleb Williams\xa0  Caleb Williams is projected to be the first overall pick in 2024. The USC Trojans quarterback likely would have been a serious contender to Bryce Young for the first overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, if he were eligible.  With the NFL beckoning, the 21-year-old has been compared to several superstars of past and present. Former Stanford Cardinal head coach David Shaw too weighed in on the QB\'s prospects going forward.         Given his stellar performances heading up to the new season, Shaw was quick to compare the future star to a QB he coached in the past.      What did David Shaw say about Caleb Williams? David Shaw served as Andrew Luck\'s offensive coordinator and head coach during his collegiate career with the Stanford Cardinal. Speaking with Daniel Jeremiah and Bucky Brooks on the Move the Sticks podcast, Shaw stated: ""There\'s only one 10 out of 10 that I have seen. That\'s Andrew Luck. When Trevor Lawrence came out, I thought he was the best since Andrew. Caleb Williams is the best since Andrew. If he\'s not a 10, he\'s a 9.999999. His improvisational skills are to the level of Patrick Mahomes. You get mesmerized watching this guy play. Shaw went on to shower further praise on the USC QB comparing his intangibles to the former Colts star.     ""He\'s special. To me, it\'s Andrew one in this generation and Caleb Williams two. I don\'t know if there is a close number three. This guy is different. His accuracy, his athletic ability, his strength... This guy has got a natural make-or-miss ability and what I love most about him, that the great ones all have, he plays the game with a sense of calm. He knows he\'s better than you."" How does Caleb Williams\' college career compare to Andrew Luck\'s? Caleb Williams joined the Oklahoma Sooners as a five-star prospect in the 2021 recruiting class. He took over the starting role midway through his true freshman season.  Williams made 11 appearances, seven of which he started. He threw for 1,912 yards, 21 touchdowns and four interceptions. Through that stretch, he completed 64.5% of his passes while adding 442 rushing yards and six touchdowns to his name.      Caleb Williams\' performances earned him a spot on the second-team All-Big 12. Williams, though, decided to move on and join the USC Trojans via the transfer portal the following season.  During his first year with the Trojans, he completed 4,537 passing yards, 42 touchdowns and just five interceptions. Williams completed 66.6% of his passes while running for 382 yards and 10 touchdowns on 113 carries.  He was named the Heisman, while also being named a unanimous All-American, Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year and first-team All-Pac 12. Andrew Luck too was a five-star prospect coming out of high school in 2008. The QB joined the Stanford Cardinal and after redshirting his true freshman season, Luck took over the starting role in 2009.  He threw for 2,575 yards, 13 touchdowns and four interceptions in 12 games. Luck completed 56.3% of his passes while adding 354 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 61 carries. He followed that up with 3,338 passing yards, 32 touchdowns and eight interceptions the following season. Luck completed 70.7% of his passes while running for 453 yards and three touchdowns on 55 carries.      Former Indianapolis Colts QB Andrew Luck He was named the Heisman runner-up while also being named a first-team All-American, Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year and first-team All-Pac 12. Luck had another impressive season in 2011, throwing for 3517 yards, 37 touchdowns and ten interceptions. He completed 71.3% of his passes while adding 150 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 47 carries. He was once again named the Heisman runner-up, a first-team All-American, Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year and first-team All-Pac 12. In 2012, Luck got the chance to live out his NFL dreams after being selected first overall by the Indianapolis Colts.     ', ""Top 5 NFL QBs over 30 heading into 2022 season  The NFL is a young man's game. The wear and tear on a football player's body not only stops them from playing at a sustained high level, year in and year out, but can shorten careers just as quickly.   Over the past several years, the NFL has a seen some of its most significant quarterbacks retire due to performance (Drew Brees) and injuries (Andrew Luck). The most important position on the football field is also one that can end just as quickly as it began.        PFF@PFFRyan Fitzpatrick is retiring from the NFL after 17 seasons What a career 396063344Ryan Fitzpatrick is retiring from the NFL after 17 seasons What a career 👏👏 https://t.co/6qdvsLaD83           Heading into the 2022 season, the quarterback position has never been this loaded with talent under 30. Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have established a budding rivalry for AFC dominance. At the same time, Justin Herbert, Kyler Murray, and Lamar Jackson continue to demonstrate their multi-level skills on a week-by-week basis, making their teams perennial contenders for the Super Bowl. However, the old guard of the NFL quarterback class is still alive and ready to lead their teams to one more shot at glory. These veteran signal callers have had plenty of accomplishments but heading into the 2022 season, they will be looked upon to not just be a part of a team's success, but to be the catalyst for that.     Here are the top five NFL quarterbacks over 30 heading into the 2022 NFL season.  #5 - Matt Ryan, 37 years old - Indianapolis Colts New York Jets v Atlanta Falcons Matt Ryan started over 200 NFL games, all for the Atlanta Falcons, winning an NFL MVP in 2016 - the same year he led the Falcons to the Super Bowl. While Ryan has never won the big game, he is perhaps in his best position since the 2016 season, now as the starter for the Indianapolis Colts.      The Colts have been looking for a quarterback since Andrew Luck's early retirement, and Ryan is the best of that bunch. Heading into the 2022 season, Ryan will surely pass for over 60,000 yards passing and has a chance to reach 400 career touchdown passes.  #4 - Russell Wilson, 33 years old - Denver Broncos Denver Broncos Introduce Quarterback Russell Wilson Russell Wilson will be heading to Denver this year not just in an attempt to make the Broncos into a serious contender for the Super Bowl, but also to prove that he can win by playing the game the way he wants to play.      Much has been made of his former head coach Pete Carroll wanting to play tough defense and run the ball, over handing the keys to Wilson. This season, Wilson will be given the keys and everything else he needs to get the Broncos out of quarterback purgatory and to challenge in the very tough AFC West.  #3 - Matthew Stafford, 34 years old - Los Angeles Rams Super Bowl LVI - Los Angeles Rams v Cincinnati Bengals Matthew Stafford silenced his doubters, leading the Los Angeles Rams to the Super Bowl last season. In doing so, Stafford proved himself to be not just a gun-slinger-type quarterback who couldn't win.      He also showed himself as one of the best leaders and quarterbacks in the NFL. His connection with Super Bowl MVP Cooper Kupp was something defenses could not figure out, and he helped revitalize the career of Odell Beckham Jr.  Heading into the 2023 season, Stafford will be looking to do the same with former Chicago Bear, Allen Robinson, in an attempt to win another wide-open NFC.

At 38 years old, Aaron Rodgers looks completely comfortable behind the line of scrimmage and his relationship with head coach Matt LaFluer seems to be on solid ground.  Rodgers and the Packers have always looked like contenders to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl and the quarterback has put up fantastic numbers, aging like fine wine.  In the past three seasons, Rodgers has thrown for over 4000 yards each year, with 110 total touchdowns and only 11 total interceptions. While the Packers and Rodgers are missing that elusive second ring, they enter the 2023 season as NFC North favorites.      #1 - Tom Brady, 44 years old - Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl LV The greatest quarterback of all time decided that he wasn't ready to hang up his cleats just yet and is returning for the the 2023 season. The Buccaneers have surrounded Brady with the talent he needs to lead the team to another championship.  Brady stands at the top of almost every NFL record there is for a quarterback, but his most impressive feats have been his playoff performances. With seven NFL championships and 10 visits to the Super Bowl, Brady remains one of the all-time best playoff performers in any sport.      Whether it's his lifestyle or situation, no other athlete has been able to play at this high a level at this advanced an age. If you were to create a list of the best NFL players over 40 heading into the 2023 season, there would only be one name on that list.       "", ""How have the Jaguars fared in London? Exploring Jacksonville's performances on the international stage  The JacksonvilleJaguars will be back in London again in the 2023 season, this time for two games.  They will meet the Atlanta Falcons in Week 4 and the Buffalo Bills the following week at Tottenham Hotspur stadium. Jags owner Shad Khan is the reason why the franchise makes so many trips to Europe. Khan also owns Premier League team Fulham which is situated in the capital.        So, how have Jacksonville fared across the pond?           A mixed bag for the Jacksonville Jaguars in the UK It all started in 2013 at Wembley, as the Jags hosted the NFC champions from the previous year. It did not end well for Jacksonville as they were embarrassed losing 42-10 to the San Francisco 49ers. They were 28-3 down at halftime, as Colin Kaepernick went 10/16 for 164 yards and a TD. The Jags were cooked on the ground giving up 221 rushing yards, a third one of which was Kaepernick. Chad Henne's 46.7 QBR rating was not enough for the Jags. 0-1 in London. Yet another bad outing for the Jags in 2014 at Wembley. They were beaten 31-17 by the Dallas Cowboys. The Jags found themselves down 24-7 at the half and could only muster up consolation points. Tony Romo had an elite game, going 20/27, for 245 yards and 3TDs. This game was never close, as the Blake Bortles era began in Duval. 0-2 in London     Finally, it happened. The Jags fans from across the world could go home happy with a 34-31 win in 2015. E.J. Manuel and the Buffalo Bills were not the toughest opponent as Bortles slightly outplayed him to guide the Jags to a late win. Young receiver Allen Robinson had a big day with 6 catches for 98 yards and one TD. 1-2 in London. The Jags would for the first time play a divisional game in London, and they would be victorious. Blake Bortles' 19/33 pass attempts for 207 yards and 2TDs was enough to outduel Andrew Luck and the Indianapolis Colts. The Jags gave up 21 points in the fourth quarter to make things nervy, but they survived the scare in the end. 2-2 in London. Hard to believe but the Jaguars had now managed three straight wins overseas. This was by far the most comfortable so far. They had scored 23 at the half and continued their hot hand, getting 21 points in the second half. Joe Flacco would be benched at one point as the Baltimore Ravens surrendered. Blake Bortles had one of the best games of his life finishing with 244 yards and 4TDS. 3-2 in London.     All good things must come to an end and so the win streak in London was no more. Carson Wentz was too much for the Jaguars defense. The Eagles ran the ball 28 times for 133 yards at 4.8 yards per carry. A record crowd at Wembley to date for the NFL international series sent Jaguars fans home unhappy. 3-3 in London. Jacksonville could not stop running back Carlos Hyde in their second divisional outing in London, which came in 2019. Hyde had 160 yards on 19 carries. Gardiner Minshew was never able to get going as he threw 47 passes with only three points to show. To add more misery, Minshew was sacked four times in the 26-3 loss to the Houston Texans. 3-4 In London. No one could have foreseen what was going to happen to the world in 2020, obviously, covid prevented the Jags from making the trip to London. They would return in October 2021 and go home happy.     Trevor Lawrence won his first game abroad in his rookie season. It wasn't such an easy day for Miami Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa. This was the first time an NFL game had been at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium. 4-4 in London. And now to the most recent Jaguars trip to London. You had to have a serious off day to lose to the 2022 Denver Broncos, but that's what happened at Wembley. Russell Wilson had his average 2022 game throwing a TD and a pick, but Lawrence was bad that afternoon with a 10 QBR. Travis Etienne's 156 yards on the ground were not enough for the Jaguars. 4-5 in London.     "", ""NFL Divisional Round Picks\xa0  With the second weekend of January upcoming, it also means that it's time for the divisional weekend of the NFL playoffs. Hopefully, this weekend's games will have as many upsets, close games, and double drinkers as there was during last weekend's wild-card games.  However, the road teams may have a harder time pulling off some upsets this weekend against the dominant top seeds in both conferences. Here's what I think will happen in the divisional round.        SATURDAY           Colts vs. Chiefs, 4:35 p.m., NBC  Both the Colts and the Chiefs will be heading into Saturday's game with potent offences, led by quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Patrick Mahomes, respectively. The Colts also are coming off a strong defensive performance in their convincing wild-card win over Texans. The Chiefs, however, have a more explosive offense than the Texans, and that should be too much for the Indy defense. Chiefs 35-13.  Cowboys vs. Rams, 8:15 p.m., FOX  The second game on Saturday will feature two of the hottest teams in the NFC heading into the postseason. In my eyes, this game has the best chance for an upset this weekend, as both of these teams are pretty even on paper. In the end, Jared Goff, Sean McVay, and the innovative Rams offense will be the difference in this divisional matchup. Rams 28-25.  SUNDAY  Chargers at Patriots, 1:05 p.m., CBS  The Los Angeles Chargers aren't your typical five-seed, having barely missed out on a first-round bye. The New England Patriots aren't your typical Pats team, as questions about Tom Brady's playing ability and age have lingered all year and their defense has struggled all year, with the focus being the league-worst pass rush.     However, there are no questions about Brady's postseason success, and his success and playmaking ability should earn the Pats to yet another AFC championship game. Patriots 30-10.  Eagles at Saints, 4:40 p.m., FOX  For the second straight postseason, the Eagles will be trying to make the Super Bowl with their backup quarterback, Nick Foles. It went pretty well last year, and it's off to a good start this year, with the help of the field goal uprights at Solider Field. However, this week, Philly will be facing an offensive juggernaut in New Orleans, led by quarterback Drew Brees, a 40-something quarterback playing like he is in his twenties. Though the Eagles have been a pretty good underdog story this year, their season will come to an end at the hands of the Saints, who are playing like the Super Bowl favorites that Vegas thinks they are. Saints 40-24.      "", '3 draft prospects Colts must consider as their next franchise QB ft. Bryce Young  After a 4-12-1 season and disappointing quarterback performances, the Indianapolis Colts have the No. 4 pick in the upcoming draft. Indianapolis is most likely set to make a major splash with the selection of a quarterback.  The Colts are in need of an elite quarterback, having been without one since Andrew Luck retired in 2019. Bryce Young looks like the next possible option at quarterback for the Colts after the Philip Rivers and Matt Ryan experiments failed.        Bryce Young           Bryce Young vs. Vanderbilt this season Alabama Crimson Tide quarterback Bryce Young might just be the No. 4 overall pick in the draft. Young is a talented, agile quarterback with a powerful arm and outstanding accuracy. He can stretch the field with his deep throws, run the ball with surprising efficiency and has the football IQ to make the correct read and throw a majority of the time. Young established himself as one of the best quarterbacks in college football, leading Alabama to a national title in 2020.     His poise in the pocket, ability to make quick decisions and experience playing in big games will make him a great candidate to lead this team. Young is the perfect fit and could be a great asset to the team. With superstar running back Jonathan Taylor and the Colts’ offensive line giving him the time he needs to make the correct reads, drafting a quarterback with Bryce Young\'s potential seems like the best move. Dov Kleiman@NFL_DovKleimanLooks like #Colts owner Jim Irsay let the cat out of the bag about the #Colts Draft plans.""The Alabama guy doesn\'t look bad, I\'ll tell ya.""The Colts currently pick at number 4.

Stroud in the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl The talent that has been displayed by the Ohio State quarterback, especially in this year\'s game vs. No. 1-ranked Georgia, makes you hesitant to select any other quarterback but C.J. Stroud in this draft.Coached by Ryan Day in college, when Stroud was starting for the Buckeyes, he went 21-4. Those only losses came against rival Michigan twice, Alabama in the national championship game, and Georgia in the semifinals this season. Despite the reputation of losing in big games, the performances have been pretty impressive from a scouting standpoint.     The surrounding help in Indianapolis may not be the same as it was at Ohio State, as the receiving core in Columbus was at an NFL-caliber level. But the Colts do have a great offensive line and a couple pieces on offense that could make an NFL team led by C.J. Stroud a scary opponent. Michael Pittman and Alec Pierce have also shown the upside of being solid wide receiver options as well. Jonathan Taylor also isn\'t the worst option to have at running back. Dorian Thompson-Robinson Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl: Pittsburgh vs. UCLA     You may not see Dorian Thompson-Robinson on top of a lot of draft boards. But from what he showed at UCLA, the talent is undeniable and would definitely be worth taking a risk. Sure, he may not be as good as other quarterbacks in this draft. He may not have the size or arm strength, but every time Thompson-Robinson was healthy, he was a threat to absolutely tear apart defenses. It could be a boom-or-bust situation. His dual-threat capability and lead-by-example style of play makes him one of at least the top five quarterback options. He can also hurdle defenders like it\'s nothing.

This ability recently came into question on ESPN\'s morning show, Get Up.           Former NFL quarterback and analyst Dan Orlovsky didn\'t mince words when he called out Wilson\'s style of play and how it could negatively affect the offensive line. Orlovsky pointed out that O-lines hate when ""quarterbacks hang on to the ball. It leads to sacks and makes their performance look worse."" He said: ""One of the things he\'s known for as a player is holding on to the ball too long because he\'s trying to create big plays. One of the things I know offensive lines hate is quarterbacks who hold on to the football too long. It leads to sacks and makes their performance look worse. I just think how quickly they both get ahold of that is going to pay off. It\'s going to be a very interesting thing for us to pay attention to how well they mesh throughout the season.""

Not many teams are… All that extra time holding defensive linemen could also lead to injuries and animosity towards Wilson. The quarterback may have to make some adjustments, which could improve his game in the long run. After all, Tom Brady has built a career around short-yardage passes. Peyton Manning, another great quarterback, also had a quick release. However, his was out of necessity due to poor protection throughout many years in Indianapolis. Hopefully, with a new team and better support around him, Wilson will excel and reinvigorate a Broncos team that has had poor luck at the position in the last few seasons.Wilson could benefit from learning how to get rid of the ball quicker. Not only will it eat yards and time off the clock, but it could help his offensive line stay healthy in the long run. It may also lead to a better locker room experience. Unsure about a trade offer?

A contrarian look to national viewpoint on Trojans signal caller  Caleb Williams is the consensus favorite to win the Heisman Trophy for the second consecutive year. Former Ohio State Buckeyes running back Archie Griffin remains the only player to win the prestigious award multiple times.  Williams has received plenty of hype since making his collegiate debut in the 2021 season. The USC Trojans quarterback is considered the top prospect in the 2024 NFL Draft and has been labeled the best quarterback prospect since Andrew Luck.         Take a look at whether or not Williams is deserving of such praise:       How has Caleb Williams performed in his college career? Caleb Williams joined the Oklahoma Sooners as a five-star prospect in the 2021 recruiting class.

His performances earned him a spot on the second team All-Big 12. Following the season, Williams followed coach Lincoln Riley and joined the USC Trojans via the transfer portal. As a sophomore, he threw for 4,537 yards, 42 touchdowns and just five interceptions. Williams completed 66.6% of his passes while running for 382 yards and 10 touchdowns on 113 carries.

', 'Kansas City Chiefs\' Week 11 Dallas Cowboys important game  The biggest game of this upcoming weekend is easily the matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys may have started the season with a loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers but have emerged as contenders in the NFC throughout the season.   A loss to the Denver Broncos two weeks ago has apparently lit a fire under the team, as they went on to have a dominant performance over the Atlanta Falcons last weekend.        The Chiefs have struggled with turnovers this season and the Cowboys\' defense features one of the best cornerbacks in the league, Trevon Diggs, who leads the league with eight interceptions.           While every game is a must-win at this point in the season, the Chiefs\' plan to win one game at a time is now at an all-time high and could determine their path moving forward this season. Kansas City Chiefs@ChiefsThe battle for the Preston Road trophy begins now 🏆 Check out our newest DTK podcast to hear the history behind this unique competition between the Cowboys and the Chiefs ➡️ chfs.me/3x3x0wE6:12 AM · Nov 18, 202133438The battle for the Preston Road trophy begins now 🏆 Check out our newest DTK podcast to hear the history behind this unique competition between the Cowboys and the Chiefs ➡️ chfs.me/3x3x0wE https://t.co/qkeEfXSviE 3 reasons why the Chiefs matchup against Cowboys is their most important game of 2021     #1 - Playoff Contention Just a month ago, it seemed that the Kansas City Chiefs hopes of making a playoff run were all but gone. Then came three consecutive wins against the New York Giants, a Green Bay Packers team without quarterback Aaron Rodgers and then a dominant performance over the Las Vegas Raiders. Now, the Chiefs have put themselves back into the playoff conversation and shown that they can be the team that they were the past two seasons. A win over the Dallas Cowboys would keep their playoff dreams alive, whereas a loss would most likely put them back in the ""bubble"" of teams who are on the outside looking in.

The Chiefs\' lead in the AFC West is just one game as the Los Angeles Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders are tied at 5-4 and the Denver Broncos are at 5-5. If the Chiefs lose to the Cowboys and the Chargers pull off a win over the Steelers, who may be without quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for a second week in a row, they would lose the title. The Raiders will play the Bengals, who struggled before their bye week, and the Broncos are currently on their bye week. A win would keep the Chiefs ahead in a tight division race. #3 - Turnover struggles Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has thrown ten interceptions this season, which is much higher than his career average. Mahomes had a much better game against the Raiders on Sunday night, where he threw for over 400 yards, five touchdowns and no interceptions.      While it appears Mahomes and the Chiefs are cleaning up their turnover issues, this week will be the biggest test in terms of opponents and whether they can make a run this season.The Cowboys defense has been one of the best in the league this season and definitely the toughest defense the Chiefs have faced this season. If they can\'t find a way to win, the Chiefs will have an uphill battle making a deep run this season.     ']"
33,Jay Cutler,"[""How many Mr. Olympia titles does Jay Cutler have?  Jay Cutler is often termed one of the top most professional bodybuilders in the history of bodybuilding. Jay was born in Sterling, Massachusetts on August 3, 1973. He has competed in 13 editions of Mr. Olympia, one of the most prestigious events in bodybuilding.  Jay Cutler has won the Mr. Olympia title four times in his career. He was crowned Mr. Olympia in 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010. His first participation in Mr. Olympia was in 1999, where he secured a 14th-place finish with 204 points.        Cutler achieved his first-ever Mr. Olympia title victory in 2006. His never-back-down performance despite finishing in second place for several years was fruitful as he finally defeated longtime rival Ronnie Coleman. Jay scored a total of 22 points. The prize money earned by Cutler for winning the 2006 Mr. Olympia was $155,000.  Jay's second Mr. Olympia title win came the following year in 2007. He won the competition by scoring 28 points and earned $155,000. Victor Martinez of the Dominican Republic finished in second place behind Cutler. The Massachusetts-born bodybuilder faced a stumbling block in his streak as he finished second in the 2008 Mr. Olympia competition. Dexter Jackson won that year. Once again, Jay made a comeback in 2009 by winning Mr. Olympia that year.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     His victory in the 2009 Mr. Olympia in a non-consecutive year was appreciated very much as the other two bodybuilders to achieve that feat were Arnold Schwarzenegger and Franco Columbu. This time the prize money won by Jay was $200,000. Cutler won his fourth and final Mr. Olympia title in 2010. Along with the title, he won $200,000. Jay competed in two more editions of Mr. Olympia in 2011 and 2013. In the 2011 edition of Mr. Olympia, Jay finished as a runner-up and earned $100,000. Cutler's last-ever Mr. Olympia competition was in 2013, where he finished in sixth place and won $30,000.  Jay Cutler's early career days From the age of 11, Jay Cutler worked in his family's concrete construction business called the Cutler Bros Concrete, according to Fitness Volt. When Jay was 18 years old, he started training during his time at Wachusett Regional High School. Cutler graduated from Quinsigamond Community College in 1993 with a degree in criminal justice because he planned on working as a Corrections Officer for a maximum security prison. Jay was inspired to step into bodybuilding after meeting Marcos Rodriguez.     Jay Cutler (Image via Generation Iron) He won his very first title the same year he graduated from college. Cutler's first win came in the 1993 Iron Bodies Invitational, but his first-ever contest was the 1992 Gold's Gym Worcester Bodybuilding Championships, according to Fitness Volt. He finished as the runner-up in that competition. Cutler's second title in 1993 was the NPC (National Physique Committee) Teen Nationals (Middleweight). At the age of 22, he won the 1995 NPC U.S. Tournament of Champions. He was the overall champion in that competition. In 2000, Jay Cutler won the IFFB Night of Champions.        Between 1995 and 2000, Jay Cutler competed in the 1996 NPC Nationals, 1998 IFBB Night of Champions, 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger Classic, 1999 IFBB Ironman Pro Invitational, and 1999 Mr. Olympia. From 2000 onwards, Culter entered his prime and would eventually go on to win several titles, including four Mr. Olympia titles.

He is one of the best Mr. Olympia performers, with seven consecutive titles from 2011-2017. In his time, Heath displayed some of the best poses in the game.  The latest episode of the Cutler Cast featured the seven-time Mr. Olympia. In conversation with four-time Mr. Olympia champion Jay Cutler, Heath revealed that he has never abused performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) during his reign in the sport and was always conservative about the use of drugs.            Heath on his PED use Heath competed with several massive names, including Dexter Jackson, Coleman, and Jay Cutler. He won multiple Sandow trophies in a row, tying the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger at seven. Heath, during the podcast, mentioned that his conservative use of PEDs came after his competing and winning naturally. ""I’m just going to say it here: I was never pushing PEDs like right away. I was competing naturally and beating guys that weren’t.""     Viewing a picture of him and Cutler together, Heath mentioned that people would repetitively nag him about his PED-use cycle. ""When I met you – that picture – when I show people that picture, they’re like, ‘what kind of stuff were you on.’ Like do you really want to know what ... I was eating. That’s the difference. I have those genetics.""         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Heath pointed out that his passion for basketball most likely helped him gain some serious mass in his legs.     ""I do think playing Division I basketball and running all the time and doing all that work ... the stimulation of being a defensive ... like I was always in the defense. Imagine being in a squat like a defensive stance non-stop."" Heath then drew a parallel between his defensive skills in basketball and his bodybuilding journey: ""We do that for a bodybuilding show being in that same stance doing lunges and all that."" Mr Olympia Phil Heath poses during a media call ahead of the 2012 IFBB Australian Pro Grand Prix XIII (Photo by Robert Cianflone/Getty Images)     During his reign as Mr. Olympia, Heath was known for his fragile skin, giving his muscles a unique definition and an edge over the other athletes. ""I think bodybuilding was the perfect sport but my skin texture is what people don’t realize — that’s what really set me apart from everybody and the person who said that was the late Peter McGough"" For the untrained eye, McGough was a legendary journalist in the sport. He provided bodybuilders with incredible insight and was a close friend of Heath\'s.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Heath criticized the turn the sport has taken today about PED use. He said athletes sacrifice muscular definitions to build bigger physiques through drugs which are quite detrimental to skin texture. ""The guys today don’t have that probably because of shot injections, probably because of their training, but as far as the poundage ... I never got intimidated by watching someone like yourself or Ronnie [Coleman] thinking that that’s what I have to do to be champion.""Nicknamed \'The Gift,\' Heath is a giant in the sport. He last competed in 2020, but in November last year, Heath promised a comeback in 2023. We cannot wait to see what the year holds for him.

The Egyptian bodybuilder finished fifth while Iran’s Hadi Choopan clinched the trophy. Following this, several veterans and experts came forward to analyze why the former two-time champion lost.  Bodybuilding icon Jay Cutler became the latest to address the surprising result of the 2022 Mr. Olympia. The four-time Olympia winner was recapping the event with Serbian bodybuilder Milos Sarcev when he discussed Ramy’s fall. Pondering over how the bodybuilder finished fifth, Cutler said that everyone was “wrong” in their predictions.        Cutler stated that Big Ramy could push back next year, even though the Egyptian did not produce the expected performance this time. Speaking about the 2022 Mr. Olympia result with Milos Sarcev on the Cutler Cast YouTube channel, Jay said: “I still think Ramy can push back [next year], if he gets back to being full and hard.” Addressing the predictions he made ahead of the competition, Cutler said that Ramy did nothing to retain his title. He added: “We were all wrong about Ramy. Ramy did not produce like we expected. I mean it just goes to show man, like we talked about all these guys, and I talked in the beginning I think on and off camera that Andrew Jacked could come in and win the first time. ""We talked about Derek Lunsford — could he be second, maybe not win it because we had this thing about Mr. Olympias never winning it on the first time once, except for the first time in 1965. Everyone on the planet thought Ramy was going to come in a repeat and win his third.”             View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post  Jay Cutler and Milos Sarcev on Big Ramy\'s Olympia form Milos Sarcev also revealed that he was surprised by Ramy’s performance at the event. He pointed out that the Egyptian won the competition in 2020 and 2021 with the same problems that also arose this time. Discussing Ramy’s fall, Sarcev said: “You [Cutler] said you were concerned about his back to the sense that [you thought] he might not even win. In a sense, you were right. But he won with the same problems last year, so you would assume they are not going to penalize him now if they didn’t last year and if he’s a little bigger and just as conditioned or better — then he would be the rightful winner.”     Following this, Jay Cutler stated that Big Ramy’s lats were his biggest problem on stage. He said: “The lats obviously, but I thought the biggest issue with Ramy was number one, his condition, but more importantly, he couldn’t open up his back. What was going on with his back?” Sarcev replied: “Now they [judges] are going to look, they’re going to scan his triceps,” Milos Sarcev said. “I would say [his back had] issues.”   With the above comments, Jay Cutler joined a list of bodybuilders who said they felt let down by Big Ramy’s form at Mr. Olympia. Recently, Ramy’s close friend/training partner Dennis James revealed that the defending champion looked “flat” hours before the competition. Bodybuilding legend Arnold Schwarzenegger was another who addressed Ramy’s poor performance.

One such athlete is Dexter jackson, who won the 2008 Olympia.  Despite only winning one Sandow trophy, Jackson has gained the status of legend in the game. This is mainly due to his position as the athlete with the most professional men\'s bodybuilding titles. In his heyday, Jackson competed against some prolific bodybuilders such as Ronnie Coleman and Jay Cutler.        In a recent video uploaded to his YouTube channel, Dexter revealed that he learned a thing or two from his former rival Jay Cutler. According to Dexter, Cutler helped him realize the woes of staying fit post-retirement: ""One thing that I learned from Jay Cutler: Jay told me, he said, ‘One thing you’re going to have how to say it – the hardest thing in life is staying in shape post-retirement.’ "" Jackson revealed that he lived a sedentary lifestyle post-retirement until he looked in the mirror one day: ""I remember, when I first retired and I took about a few months off, you know… sitting on the couch all the time, I pulled them clothes off one day, boy, I looked in that mirror, and I was like, ‘Oh hell no!’ So, that’s what motivated me to get back in the gym and get to work.""     As of now, Dexter Jackson, at the age of 53, still looks like a professional bodybuilder. It is rumored that he may be heading to compete in the Masters Olympia later this year.

He reiterated the importance of a good and balanced diet in maintaining shape. He said:     ""Because I still weighed about what I weigh now, about 205, 210 but I wasn’t in shape. So I was only eating like twice a day. Now, I took my meals up to four meals a day. It’s amazing how the body responds when you give the body more fuel and more food and all that stuff and just the difference in how you look, you know what I’m saying."" Seeing his amazing physique at his age, Jackson added that many people asked him if he was on steroids or performance enhancers. He revealed that he is avoiding all the drugs in pursuit of living a longer life: ""A lot of people saying, ‘Oh boy, you back on shit again.’ Man, no, them days are over. I’m trying to live another 50.""     Through his social media platforms and his YouTube channel, Jackson is known for imparting knowledge surrounding bodybuilding and fitness. In classic fashion, Dexter added that he is looking forward to teaching people how to live a longer life: ""I’m going to teach you guys how to live a long life. I taught you already how to have a long bodybuilding career, now I’m going to teach you how to live another 50 on top of that. ""According to Dexter, something is breqing in the background - some tips for his audience to live healthier lives.

Samir Bannout, a former Olympia winner, had a similar opinion on the weak field for the 2023 Arnold Classic. Bannout even made a joke about entering the competition himself due to the lack of competitors. Hunter Labrada and Derek Lunsford were his two suggestions for guests.     Although Arnold Schwarzenegger raised the prize money for the winner of the Men\'s Open category to a record $300,000, not many elite bodybuilders have registered.

Since Joe Weider\'s yearly Olympia Fitness and Performance Weekend, the competition has grown to become the second most prominent bodybuilding event since its establishment in 1989. However, it appears that a lot has changed. The tentative lineup for each division for the upcoming contest was released by the organizers last week. Brandon Curry, who won the 2022 Arnold Classic, does not appear to be participating in the upcoming competition, allowing for the emergence of a new winner. Shaun Clarida, a two-time 212 Olympia champion, and Kamal Elgargni, a former 212 Olympia champion, have joined the Open division roster. William Bonac and Samson Dauda will also be present. Shaun Clarida intimated that he would have to out-pose Samson on the Arnold stage while talking about the Dauda clash, adding that he\'s looking forward to the call-out.     Blessing decided to withdraw from the competition after a lackluster performance at the 2022 Mr. Olympia so that his body could rest and heal.

Tim Tebow and Jay Cutler  Sometimes, NFL comebacks can inspire just about any human being because of how unlikely it was, in hindsight, for them to have been successful. Alex Smith's miraculous return in 2020 - one that followed rumors that his leg could be amputated altogether after a compound fracture in the fibula and tibia of his right leg - comes to mind as one of those.            Rob Gronkowski's recent Super Bowl-winning return the same year was a feel-good story in its own right, highlighting the human element of the sport, due to his friendship with Tom Brady and on-field connection.           TB12@TomBradyEgoIn 2018 Rob Gronkowski would’ve retired if he was traded to Lions because he didn’t want to play with any QB other than Tom Brady. 2 years later Gronk is coming out of retirement to play with Tom in Tampa BayGet you a friend who is as loyal to you as Gronk is to Brady2420389In 2018 Rob Gronkowski would’ve retired if he was traded to Lions because he didn’t want to play with any QB other than Tom Brady. 2 years later Gronk is coming out of retirement to play with Tom in Tampa BayGet you a friend who is as loyal to you as Gronk is to Brady https://t.co/PBe1gC92Zn The aforementioned returns brought either titles or tears to the eyes. With that said, it's fair to say that not all NFL comebacks go as swimmingly. Frankly, some fall flat in spectacular fashion. That is our focus here. Here are 5 NFL comebacks that didn't work out      Tim Tebow's NFL return was short-lived and sad Tim Tebow Urban Meyer's attempt to resurrect the career of Tim Tebow was not one that lacked an understandable pretense, but it was one that failed spectacularly in execution.        Meyer and Tebow won two National Championships together at Florida, with one of them featuring the lefty signal-caller starting under center. Tebow won the Heisman in the season sandwiched between those titles. It was undeniable that the partnership between the coach and QB was always one that benefitted all parties. It was always going to be a challenge transitioning from a great QB at the college level to a tight end, but Tebow didn't make it to the beginning of the regular season before the experiment ended.  Kelvin Benjamin didn't last long on the Giants in 2021     Kelvin Benjamin While Tim Tebow at least made it to August last offseason, Kelvin Benjamin couldn't even make it to the end of July in his own failed NFL comeback bid with the New York Giants. Wesley Steinberg@WesSteinbergThe #Giants have cut TE Kelvin Benjamin. Video surveillance footage showed Benjamin had been stealing food from the facility to take home. Benjamin was told by Gettleman and Judge before storming off and leaving camp.2794842The #Giants have cut TE Kelvin Benjamin. Video surveillance footage showed Benjamin had been stealing food from the facility to take home. Benjamin was told by Gettleman and Judge before storming off and leaving camp. https://t.co/cuYI2iWDP7 Benjamin, who like Tebow has never played TE at the highest level, tried to transition to a new position after seeing his speed decline in the years since he last excelled in the NFL. That didn't work, and resulted in a predictable roster cut from the Giants' front office that had already added Kevin Rudolph to the Big Blue TE room in 2021.      Adrian Peterson didn't make waves in his 2021 NFL return Adrian Peterson For so long, Adrian Peterson was one of the most dominant workhorse running backs in the NFL history. In 2012, he won the quarterback-dominated MVP award.  He was the last RB to do so, and given the shifts in how the game is played, may end up being the final rusher to win the award. His decline predictably came in his early 30s, with the 2015 season being the last time he was at that level.        Peterson did have a strong 2018 season, but he declined considerably in the following years in Washington, and in Detroit during the 2020 pandemic-stricken season. No one gave him a deal ahead of the 2021 season. Eventually, in the wake of Derrick Henry's injury, Peterson got a chance this past November with the Titans, but he bombed. His NFL comeback flailed even further in Seattle, where he amassed 16 rushing yards on 11 carries.  Antonio Brown had a great NFL comeback until he walked out on his team     Antonio Brown After the stunts Antonio Brown pulled on the Las Vegas (then Oakland) Raiders, the long-time Steelers WR1 was lucky to have ever gotten another chance in the NFL. Luckily, his friend Tom Brady had his back. Twice.    After he was abruptly released by the Raiders in 2019, Brown found a new home with the Patriots, but he was cut after just one game due to allegations of sexual and personal misconduct levied against him.      A year later, Brady brought him to the Buccaneers and the two won the title in Tampa together. Brown's return bid went swimmingly until it didn't. During the 2021 season, all goodwill dissipated when the mercurial wideout walked out of a game against the Jets at MetLife Stadium. That impulsive act cost him his career with the Bucs, and might have been the last straw in his NFL career.  Jay Cutler's NFL comeback attempt was pointless Jay Cutler Jay Cutler's retirement from football was short-lived. But he probably wishes he could have a few mulligans and undo his actions during the 2017 offseason. That's when he chose to unretire, ditch his newly rewarded Fox Sports analyst role, and sign with the Dolphins.     Miami needed a fill-in QB, but the version of Cutler that they got wasn't needed for anything other than mediocrity. Which is exactly what the Dolphins got that season with a 6-8 record when Cutler started.These days, you can find Cutler in the backpage headlines for hooking up with his good friend's wife. It's been a fall from grace for Cutler since his lone Pro Bowl season in 2008 with the Broncos, and his 2017 NFL comeback bid with the Dolphins certainly didn't cushion it.

But he will have a tough time beating fellow contenders Samson Dauda, Andrew Jacked, and Mamdouh \'Big Ramy\' Elssbiay, a former two-time Mr Olympia champion.  Dauda is sure he can beat Walker by playing his own game since he thinks he has a stronger overall package. Jay Cutler, a former four-time Mr Olympia champion, provided his opinion on the upcoming competition a few days ago. Although he thought Walker had a good chance of winning, he believes Ramy may surprise everyone if he plays his best game.  Walker, Jacked, and Dauda will be the top competitors for the prize, according to bodybuilding expert Milos Sarcev. He acknowledged Walker\'s apparent freakiness but contended that shape and appearance should come first.  Nick Walker wants to maintain a physique like Jay Cutler     Nick Walker just revealed his top workout advice on YouTube. He applauded Jay Cutler for keeping up his toned figure even after quitting football. When the time comes for him to hang up his posing trunks, he intends to continue in his footsteps. ""I like the way Jay Cutler took his approach. He’s nowhere near his size but he ain’t small. He enjoys training and eating healthy. I enjoyed doing that before I competed. What am I going to do when I’m done completing? The same sh*t.""         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     When Nick Walker was placed fourth at the Chicago Pro in 2020, he initially garnered attention for his abnormal muscular growth and bulk. The following year, Walker put together an incredible campaign that began with a convincing victory at the 2021 New York Pro. Before proceeding to the Mr Olympia contest, where he debuted with a fifth-place finish, he picked up another victory at the Arnold Sports Festival in 2021.

They provide us with a foundation as they support athletic performance. But people usually ignore lower body workouts and focus on the upper body muscles. However, this wasn't the case with bodybuilder Jay Cutler. He always focused on every muscle in his body and achieved great success in the industry as a result. His workout inspired many people. He even defeated eight-time Mr. Olympia winner Ronnie Coleman in 2006.            Cutler continued to work hard and put in all his efforts to stay in shape and healthy. He is also known for having four Mr. Olympia title wins to his name. Cutler retained his name at the top three more times (2007, 2009, and 2010).      High-volume leg workout of Jay Cutler 1.) Reverse Hack Squats This exercise is vital for a strong foundation as it strengthens thigh muscles. However, it also improves hip and ankle agility, which has other benefits that help with other lower body lifts like heavy deadlifts.         2.) Leg Extension This exercise is all about quadricep resistance weight training. It's performed using a machine known as the Leg Extension Machine. It also contributes to reinforcing the lower body.         3.) Belt Squat Belt squats are the simplest way to employ movement. Bodybuilders use a normal dip-belt with a load slung between their thighs. The issue comes with clearance, so it has been seen that individuals practice these by standing on two boxes or using benches so that the weight can dip below their foot level and they can get better results from it.     4.) Standing Leg Curl This exercise is also known as the Hamstring Curl, and it is performed to isolate the hamstrings. It involves bending the posture of the knees and moving the heels towards the butt while the rest of the body stays static. The quads are pressed in the opposite direction of the pad, notably decreasing the possibility of other muscles compensating for it.         5.) Seated Leg Curl This exercise is also known as a seated hamstring curl, and is performed with a weight machine to work the muscles in the back of the thigh. The muscle can be more effectively strengthened by being seated rather than being positioned inclined.         Conclusion Jay Cutler is one of the most prominent bodybuilders that has passed really well into the aura of social media. He is an influential personality and one of the best voices in the sport of bodybuilding. He also runs a successful podcast, the Cutler Cast, where he interacts with people in the bodybuilding industry and gives bodybuilding advice. His workout videos and interactive sessions are a vital source of energy for those looking to become a great bodybuilder.

After carving out a successful career as a professional in the sport, he has taken up the role of a mentor in recent years by using his various platforms to help younger athletes in the game.  The 2023 Arnold Classic concluded with a bang as Samson Dauda took the title home. However, it has raised a few questions regarding the judging on the show, with many believing that Nick \'The Mutant\' Walker deserved the first place. In a recent episode of Jaywalking, Cutler had some words of advice for the young bodybuilder.        ""If I could say anything, I did mention this to Nick, is you got to work with your strengths. His strengths is definitely outmuscling people. Unfortunately, he’s not going to overly shape a Samson or a Derek Lunsford.""         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Nick Walker definitely brought the most well-conditioned package to the Arnold Classic. This fact was even admitted to by the champion Samson Dauda and his coach. However, his symmetry and proportions were a little off.     Cutler added that the top three positions could\'ve gone either way: ""The top three could’ve gone anyway in my opinion ... I had predicted Nick, and I thought nick could’ve won it. He could have but Samson looked incredible. Andrew made a huge impact, huge improvements. From the judges’ talk, Nick didn’t appear as full and round as maybe the Olympia, which he says he was better. I talked to him yesterday."" Although Cutler believes Walker could have gone home with the title, he takes nothing away from crowned champion Samson Dauda: ""I feel Nick is constantly improving. His shape has improved tremendously. He was the frontrunner going in. It didn’t go his way. He missed out on a huge payday to an unbelievable Samson. That was huge for him. He’s massive. Milos said he weighed around 290. Obviously, he’s a little taller.""         Jay Cutler believes there is an incoming ""threat"" of ""taller guys"" with the introduction of Samson Dauda and Andrew Jacked The Open division of bodybuilding has historically seen athletes with average heights win more titles. This is primarily due to the issue of proportionality with taller athletes. However, Cutler believes there may be a surge of success for taller athletes in the near future, especially seeing the success Dauda and Jacked saw at the Arnold Classic.     ""But is this the threat of the taller guys coming in now with him and Andrew Jacked who really people question he could’ve won or came in second or third.""         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Cutler praised Andrew Jacked for his performance at the Classic against some of the best bodybuilders in the world. ""Andrew didn’t have the overwhelming wow factor that he had in the earlier shows and I think because he was in such great condition standing next to those guys. It’s a different lineup. You can say so-and-so placed at the Olympia so I got past them and now I’m in this position. That’s not true though. It’s show to show. That can change dramatically.""With Mr. Olympia approaching, the top three finishers at the Arnold Classic will be looking to make significant improvements to try and dethrone Hadi Choopan.

Jay Cutler is one of the most accomplished bodybuilders in recent memory. Since his retirement in 2013, however, he hasn't lifted in any capacity in the last nine years. Many of his fans must therefore be wondering what he's up to now.  Given the solo nature of bodybuilding, it's tougher to remain involved with the sport beyond retirement than it is for other sports. Players of basketball, football, baseball, and the like can enter coaching or broadcasting—two things that are less common in bodybuilding.        Cutler has not competed in a while and has turned his focus to his company, Cutler Nutrition, which is a bodybuilding supplement business. However, he also has promotions and other business ventures on social media. Arguably, he's been just as successful since he retired, if not more.    Additionally, he and a partner, Pat LaFreida, teamed up to make one of Cutler's dreams come true. They own CUTS: Monthly Subscription Boxes of Fresh Protein, a company that puts meat right on subscribers' doorsteps.     Since stepping down from professional competition, the bodybuilder has become a bit of a capitalist, working mainly on the business side of things. Despite not competing, however, Jay Cutler has not stopped working out. Even at the age of 48, he spends a lot of time in the gym. It's been many years since he competed, but he still looks like he could go out there and give it another shot. At some point, bodybuilders are no longer able to participate in the activity they loved so much in their prime, but Cutler has not given up his favorite pastime just yet. It seems that, for as long as he is able, the former star bodybuilder will continue to work on his business ventures and his body.  Jay Cutler's prime: How good was the bodybuilder? Cutler is a four-time Mr. Olympia. He won in 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010. He finished second in 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2011. In his final Mr. Olympia competition, he finished sixth.     His 2001 placement was revoked when he was banned on account of illegal diuretic substances, but he sued to have the placement reinstated. The bodybuilder in 2022 (Image via Men's Health) He is just the third-ever Mr. Olympia to win in non-consecutive years. Many bodybuilders who lose aren't able to regain their form so easily and win another one later. He also won consecutive Arnold Classics in 2002, 2003, and 2004. He placed second to Ronnie Coleman in the Mr. Olympia competition four times before he was able to break through and win one.        Here are his incredible stats from his competing days, per Wikipedia: Height: 5 ft 9 in (175 cm)Off-season weight: 290–310 pounds (132–141 kg)Competition weight: 260–274 pounds (118–124 kg)Upper arms: 22 in (56 cm)Chest: 58 in (150 cm)Thighs: 30 in (76 cm)Waist: 29 in (74 cm)Calves: 20 in (51 cm)Thanks to his amazing performance during his competitive years and shrewd business acumen following his retirement, he is one of the richest bodybuilders in the world. He presently has a net worth of about $30 million.

34,Dwayne Haskins,"[""3 takeaways from Dwayne Haskins' performance in the Hall of Fame Game  Whether or not Dwayne Haskins has a future in the NFL is likely to be decided in the 2021 NFL preseason.  Sure, it's a lot of pressure, but it's the reality of the situation. Haskins was selected 15th overall by the Washington Football Team in the 2019 draft. What followed was a tumultuous two seasons with the Football Team.        In his two years in Washington, Haskins had 2,804 passing yards and 12 touchdowns, sub-par numbers at best. What was even more unsettling was that Haskins threw 14 interceptions. His production was underwhelming, to say the least, but it's not what ultimately got him released.           The final nail in his coffin at WFT was reportedly a poor work ethic and a lack of leadership skills. Luckily for Haskins, the Steelers had an ongoing battle for the backup quarterback spot and felt signing Haskins to compete for the role was worth the risk. In Thursday's preseason opener in Pittsburgh, all eyes were on Haskins. It was his first chance to change the narrative surrounding his skills as an NFL quarterback. With the dust settled on Thursday's game, here are three takeaways from Haskins' performance on the night. 3 takeaways from Dwayne Haskins' showing  #1 - He has a real shot at the number two quarterback job     The battle to back up Ben Roethlisberger is a three-man race between Haskins, Mason Rudolph and Joshua Dobbs. Rudolph is the favorite to win the job as he's been Roethlisberger's backup quarterback for the past two seasons. That said, the backup quarterback job is still very much undecided. The position battle will ultimately be decided by the top performer in training camp and preseason action. For this reason, Thursday night's first preseason game was of huge importance to Haskins, Rudolph, and Dobbs. All three quarterbacks played a good amount of snaps against the Cowboys. Rudolph finished 6/9 with 84 passing yards and one fumble. Meanwhile, Haskins was 8/13 with 54 passing yards. Dobbs played the fewest snaps but also had the game's only passing touchdown. He ended the game 4/6 with 37 passing yards, one touchdown and one fumble. Looking solely at the stats, Haskins' performance wasn't worth noting. Dig a little deeper, and it was clear Haskins had his moments.     Dwayne Haskins’ best throw of the night. Linemen’s right leg is between Haskins’ base he and can’t step up.His ability to improvise arm angles and arm strength are on display as he’s able to nicely place the ball in front of the receiver. Great throw!Looked confident tonight. pic.twitter.com/CLm5DEwLR6— Zareh Kantzabedian (@ZKantzFF) August 6, 2021 He commanded the offense, was poised, and made some good throws. His decision-making was also more reliable than that of Rudolph or Dobbs. Just one above-average preseason game won't win Haskins the number two quarterback job, but it does make it clear that he has a real shot. #2 - He's much more careful with the football Part of what made Haskins such a liability on the field with the Washington Football Team was his proneness to turning the ball over.     As previously mentioned, Haskins has 14 interceptions in the 16 regular-season games he's played in his career. That's not the only problem, though. Haskins has 12 career fumbles, six in both the 2019 and 2020 seasons. Twelve fumbles in only 16 career games played makes for one of the highest fumble rates in the NFL. With turnover issues of that magnitude, it was important to see how Haskins would take care of the ball in the Steelers' preseason opener. Haskins had zero turnovers Thursday night. He was about as careful with the football as he's ever been. Ironically, Haskins was the only Steelers quarterback to not fumble the football. It's important to keep in mind that this was only one game. Yes, Haskins was much more efficient, but this is something he needs to do consistently to be a productive quarterback. How he takes care of the ball in preseason game number two will be intriguing to watch.     #3 - The upside is still evident Although it never worked out in Washington, it was always clear that Haskins has the potential to be a good quarterback. Look no further than his 2018 season with the Ohio State Buckeyes to see how good Haskins can really be. He threw for 4,831 yards and had 50 passing touchdowns.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Dwayne Haskins, Jr. (@dh_simba7) He flashed some of that same potential on Thursday night. When Haskins is dialed in, his upside is tremendous. The problem throughout his NFL career is that he hasn't always been dialed in.Some of the on-the-field struggles Haskins faces can be fixed through good coaching. However, concerns about Haskins' work ethic and leadership can only be fixed by himself. If he can get himself right in those departments, he'll have a bright NFL future because his natural talent is very much still there.     "", ""3 major talking points from Dwayne Haskins' performance as he fights for a roster spot  The Pittsburgh Steelers played their final preseason game Friday as they faced off against the Carolina Panthers. The game had many implications regarding players trying to secure a spot on the roster this season. One specific player had a tremendous amount of pressure to perform well. That player being: Dwayne Haskins.  In today's press conference, Coach Tomlin said that Dwayne Haskins will start at QB against the Panthers on Friday. pic.twitter.com/zk7jcIUIF5— Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) August 25, 2021        The Steelers were defeated by the Panthers in dominating fashion. The final score was 34-9 as Pittsburgh looked woefully unprepared, and the offense that Dwayne Haskins was leading appeared to be nonexistent.           Here's a look at three takeaways from the Steelers' final 2021 preseason game. Dwayne Haskins will not be the backup QB Haskins, 24, finished with a staline of 9-for-16 completed passes for 108 yards, a touchdown and an interception. The Steelers offense struggled mightily and conjured up a touchdown on their final drive as a result of garbage time. His touchdown score was merely stat padding as his play throughout the game didn't match the numbers he finished with. Dwayne Haskins got a start against the #Panthers No. 1 defense tonight. He's 3-of-7 for 24 yards with an interception and the Steelers have 32 yards through 20 minutes of football.— Grant Paulsen (@granthpaulsen) August 28, 2021     Mason Rudolph has underperformed throughout all of training camp, but his experience with the Steelers, coupled with Haskins' inability to perform outside of practice, will grant the former the backup position this upcoming season. Haskins may not make the Steelers roster After a disastrous stint with the Washington Football Team, the former first-round pick failed to show any improvement during his time with the Steelers. IN his two years with Washington, he threw for 2,804 yards along with 12 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. Dwayne Haskins' talent is undeniable, however hhe consistently fails to comprehend NFL playbook's and it's on full display every time he walks on to the field. Mike Tomlin doesn't tolerate players that are unprepared come game time. Meaning, Dwayne Haskins' brief tenure with the Steelers could very well be coming to an end in the coming days. The Steelers still need to find Big Ben's successor     Mason Rudolph clearly isn't the answer to succeed Ben Roethlisberger when all is said and done. There was hope that maybe Haskins could be that answer, considering he was the 15th overall pick in the 2019 NFL draft.Unfortunately, the Steelers' attempt to make another man's trash their treasure failed. With Roethlisberger entering season 18 at the age of 39, it's imperative that the front office find his replacement.Haskins could still potentially be that guy. But as of now, his play has proven otherwise and it remains unclear if he'll even make the roster this season.     "", ""NFL: What is next for Dwayne Haskins?  News broke on Monday that the Washington Football Team had released quarterback Dwayne Haskins, an expected move after his performance against the Carolina Panthers in what was a must-win game for Washington to secure a spot in the playoffs.  Haskins had his ups and downs in the 2020 season, as the second-year QB started the first four games of the season, going 1-3. He was benched and demoted to third-string QB after that and Kyle Allen was named the starter, with veteran Alex Smith as the backup.        Washington Football Team QB Dwayne Haskins Jr. took a sack on this play.You’ve got to be kidding me...#WashingtonFootball pic.twitter.com/78arXCmU0x— WFT Analysis | #BeatPHI (@WFTanalysis) December 28, 2020           Shortly after that, Allen suffered a season-ending leg injury, giving head coach Ron Rivera a difficult decision to either start Smith or Haskins. Eventually, Smith became the starting quarterback with Haskins being his backup. It wasn't expected for Haskins to ever see the field again unless Washington couldn't make it to the playoffs, but the day came when Smith was injured against the San Francisco 49ers and Haskins took over for the next two and a half games. His performance was average at best but was simply not good against the Panthers last week.      Will Dwayne Haskins ever see the field again? Many believe that Haskins' career as an NFL QB is simply done for. But since his rookie season, he has shown signs of being a star quarterback for a team willing to take a risk. Haskins is considered an old-school quarterback and not as mobile as many up-and-coming QBs in the league currently. That was one reason why he wasn't taken ahead of New York Giants' quarterback Daniel Jones in the same draft class. The fact of the matter is that Haskins needs to sit for a whole season behind a seasoned veteran, similar to Alex Smith. Teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers, New England Patriots, Atlanta Falcons, and even the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could sit a young guy who needs to mature over time to show what he can do on the field again. Wishing the best for @dh_simba7 You are only 23! Learn from this and bounce back— Robert Griffin III (@RGIII) December 28, 2020     He may not have worked out in the system that Washington has created, but Haskins could work out elsewhere. The situation brought to Haskins reminds us of Josh Rosen, who was drafted in the first round and then cut after one season with the Arizona Cardinals.Since then, he has been around a few teams and on practice squads. But Haskins certainly has more talent than Rosen, it's simply a matter of time and maturity for the former Ohio State quarterback.     "", 'NFL: Washington\'s Steven Montez likes a demeaning tweet about teammate Dwayne Haskins  Things have gone from bad to worse for Washington Football Team\'s second-year quarterback, Dwayne Haskins.   Since the start of the season, he has been shaky with his performance as the starter. And after his start against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 4, Haskins was thrown under the bus by his own teammate on Twitter.        Undrafted rookie quarterback Steven Montez recently liked a tweet from a passionate Washington Football fan, who called Haskins \'garbage\'.           Washington backup QB Steven Montez likes tweet calling Dwayne Haskins ""garbage"" pic.twitter.com/ByAsRyQRK3— Main Team (@MainTeamSports) December 22, 2020 It\'s safe to say that most fans also agree that Haskins simply has not been competent enough during his run with Washington. Against the Seahawks, Haskins completed 38 of 55 passes for 295 yards with one touchdown and two passes. While he certainly made an effort to give Washington a win, it ultimately went in vain.  What is plaguing Dwayne Haskins?     Dwayne Haskins was benched and considered the third-string quarterback after his Week 4 performance against the Baltimore Ravens. He was placed behind Kyle Allen and veteran Alex Smith at that time.  After Kyle Allen\'s season-ending injury, Haskins was promoted to back up veteran Alex Smith, who has won four of five games as the starter. However, Smith strained his right calf against the San Francisco 49ers, rendering him unable to return to that game.  It seemed like the coaching staff wanted to be cautious with his calf, considering his horrendous injury back in 2018 on the same right leg.With the playoffs around the corner coupled with Smith\'s questionable performance in Week 16 against Carolina Panthers, Dwayne Haskins could be up for another start. But his recent off-field issue with violating the COVID-19 protocol, again could give another QB like Steven Montez a chance to take the helm for Washington.     ', ""NFL: Dwayne Haskins released by Washington  The pain has finally ended for Washington Football Team fans, as quarterback Dwayne Haskins was released on Monday by the team.  After an abysmal performance by Haskins against the Carolina Panthers in Week 16 -- which was a must-win game for the team to secure a playoff spot -- Haskins was let go due to his on-the-field struggles and off-the-field problems.        Washington has released QB Dwayne Haskins, per me and @TomPelissero.— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) December 28, 2020           Haskins completed 14 of 28 passes on Sunday, along with two interceptions for a total rating of 36.9. He was benched late in the fourth quarter for backup Taylor Heinicke, who later gave Washington some hope by throwing a touchdown to running back J.D. McKissic, making it a one-score game for the team.  What is next for Dwayne Haskins? The former first-round draft pick had high expectations to develop into the franchise quarterback the team had drafted in 2019. Considering he went through three head coaches and played for Jay Gruden's staff that reportedly did not want to pick him from the beginning, his future was bleak with the team.     We have released QB Dwayne Haskins pic.twitter.com/KRrWxWra7E— Washington Football Team (@WashingtonNFL) December 28, 2020 Coming into the 2020 season with new head coach Ron Rivera, who had shown promise for Haskins to lead the offense, the Ohio State product was a letdown after the first four games of the season. He was not only benched, but demoted to the third-string QB before being given another chance to start in recent weeks. While some Washington fans wished for some sort of compensation through a trade rather than just releasing Haskins, this move benefits both parties. Washington will no longer have to deal with the immaturity he brought with him to the organization, and can focus on the crucial Week 17 game against the Philadelphia Eagles.     Haskins could end up on a team where he can compete for the QB1 job. Physically, he has plenty left in his system to prove who he is on the field, but that place is not in Washington. A team like the New England Patriots or Pittsburgh Steelers could turn around Haskins and make him into a worthy starting QB.4th down sack - Looks like Haskins works the concept to his right off the snap, but had Cam Sims open to his left. After nothing was open, he began to scramble and never saw Sims, who was still open.

Former Washington QB showing great improvements in preseason  Is Dwayne Haskins the best choice as QB2 in Pittsburgh?  Less than nine months ago, QB Dwayne Haskins was released by the Washington Football Team after being the 15th overall pick in 2019. After a decent rookie year, he was named the 2020 starter by head coach Ron Rivera after coming to camp leaner and playing well in the preseason. Dwayne Haskins was benched prior to Week 5 due to a poor work ethic and performance on the field. After breaking COVID-19 protocol several times with the team in playoff contention late in the season, Haskins was released before the end of the season. Rivera stated he was cut because of his poor decision-making and not meeting off-field team standards. The Pittsburgh Steelers signed him to freshen up their competition for QB2 and Ben Roethlisberger\'s eventual replacement. Mason Rudolph has been the backup since 2018 but has yet to secure the spot long-term. Joshua Dobbs is in his second stint with the Steelers and has potential that has never fully been unlocked.

He later called his release and blown chance in the NFL a ""blessing"" and that playing for his hometown team felt more like a ""burden"".

Instead, he started off hot out of the gate in camp with accuracy, TDs, high yardage and big plays. He even led all of the Pittsburgh QBs with 20+ yard completions. As camp proceeded, he eventually cooled off but remained in the battle. In his first 2021 NFL preseason game, Dwayne Haskins went 8/13 for 54 yards (4.2 yards per attempt) as the backup to starter Mason Rudolph. He completed three of his four passes on 3rd down, but never converted. He was credited by head coach Mike Tomlin for being smart on the field, but came up short in the moment.     In Week 1, Dwayne Haskins went off with 16/22 for 161 yards and a TD while scoring on four of his five drives as the backup to Rudolph again. Mike Tomlin praised him for being ""in command"" of the offense by going through his reads well and making good decisions under pressure. Haskins called the game the most fun he has had since being drafted in the NFL. One of his major blunders was a miscommunication on a play and he ran right into the defense while his blockers went the opposite way. Still, he has the edge on Mason Rudolph through two games. Ben Roethlisberger will play in Week 2 versus the Detroit Lions and it\'s unclear who the backup will be. Haskins and Rudolph should split the load, though. Dwayne Haskins performs like a \'jazz player\' in bid to earn Steelers\' No. 2 QB job https://t.co/tUYteNw77E #Steelers pic.twitter.com/km1WWtkwvd— Steelers Depot (@Steelersdepot) August 13, 2021     At this rate, Dwayne Haskins is poised to beat out Mason Rudolph, who could end up being traded in the process. But is he the best fit as Roethlisberger\'s backup? Mason Rudolph plays similar to Ben\'s style, but for the Steelers, Dwayne Haskins is the best option for them. He has the intangibles that Rudolph doesn\'t, but has taken a hit to his mental skills on the field with a shaken confidence. That seems to have been repaired by Pittsburgh, and he\'s shown the same potential he had as a top draft prospect. Haskins is less than a few months into playing in this new system, one new to all of the QBs, and already has the edge in it. We haven\'t seen how Ben Roethlisberger will play in Matt Canada\'s new offense, but Haskins has taken to it better than Rudolph and Dobbs. Haskins won\'t start the regular season barring a major injury to Ben, but if he can continue his success with the offense throughout practice during the season, 2022 could be Dwayne Haskins\' redemption as a starter in the NFL.

This season, he has posted 3,340 yards, 37 touchdowns, and only six interceptions. In both seasons, he finished in the top four in Heisman voting.

While many of those guys go on to become stars at the next level, quarterbacks from that school just don’t tend to pan out for some reason. Drafted by the Baltimore Colts fourth overall in 1982, former Buckeye Art Schlichter played only 13 NFL games and is now known as one of the biggest draft busts of all time.     We\'ve also seen tons of other Buckeye QB legends like Troy Smith—the last player from the school to win the Heisman Trophy—Bobby Hoying, Cardale Jones, Dwayne Haskins, and J.T. Barrett fail to emerge as impact NFL players. However, Justin Fields just might’ve broken the “Ohio State Quarterback Curse.” The current Chicago Bears star, who’s in his second pro season, has over 1,000 rushing yards this year, as he has joined Michael Vick and Lamar Jackson as the only quarterbacks in NFL history to accomplish such a feat.

Another disappointing performance sparks debate on reigning MVP\'s future  Another week, another underwhelming performance from future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers.  It\'s hard to find a more accomplished player in NFL history than the man under center in Green Bay.        Whether it\'s owning an NFL record, winning the MVP award, or taking home the Lombardi trophy, Rodgers has done it all.           They don\'t call him the \'Baaaad Man\' for no reason. However, Aaron Rodgers\' last handful of performances have been anything but what NFL fans have grown accustomed to from the reigning back-to-back MVP. As a direct result, the Packers are 0-3 through the last three weeks of football - the first time Green Bay has had a losing streak under head coach Matt LaFleur. The losing streak started when Green Bay faced off against the New York Giants in London. The Packers quarterback threw for 222 yards with two touchdowns, completing 25 passes on 39 attempts. Not a bad statline by any means. It wasn\'t the numbers that were off with Rodgers\' performance; it was how he played when all the chips were on the table. Not only did Rodgers lead the Packers to zero points in the fourth quarter, but the offense didn\'t add a single point through the entire second half.     What started as a 20-10 lead heading into the fourth ended in a 22-27 defeat. The following two weeks haven\'t been much different. The All-Pro quarterback has logged a combined three touchdowns and zero interceptions against the New York Jets and Washington Commanders. Meanwhile, he\'s only been able to score one touchdown in the fourth quarter and has fallen flat in the biggest moments down the stretch. All of this begs the question - should the Packers\' legendary QB call it a career?  How long does Aaron Rodgers plan on playing? Aaron Rodgers for Green Bay Packers v Washington Commanders     At 38 years old, there\'s nothing left for Aaron Rodgers to prove. He\'s not only well past the average retirement age of his position, but has played at an extremely high level for over a decade. Not to mention, he isn\'t exactly enticed by the thought of playing football in his 40s. When asked if he planned on playing football at the age of 45, like his fellow NFL constituent Tom Brady, Rodgers responded with three simple words: ""No, I don\'t."" So, should Aaron Rodgers walk away from the game after this season? It\'s important not to get too ahead of ourselves here. The last couple of weeks have looked rough for the 38-year-old, but let\'s not forget who the most recent winner of the MVP award is. In fact, you\'d have to leave the 2020s to find the last time Aaron Rodgers wasn\'t the NFL\'s Most Valuable Player. A month of underwhelming football isn\'t enough to trump that.     It\'s also worth mentioning that the four-time first-team All-Pro isn\'t playing particularly bad football; he just isn\'t playing his brand of football. Most quarterbacks would sleep well at night if they had nine touchdowns with only three interceptions to their name. The 66.8 completion percentage (12th) and 94.9 quarterback rating (10th) aren\'t bad either. It\'s just not the level we\'re used to seeing from him. But are things bad enough to make the \'Baaaad Man\' consider retirement? Rodgers still isn\'t sure exactly when he\'ll hang it up, but he does seem to be sure he won\'t be playing for as long as Brady has. In early June, the Packers\' QB1 had stated that he ""thinks about retirement all the time"" during a golf event with Tom Brady.However, as it stands, Aaron Rodgers is contractually bound to Green Bay until 2026 after signing a three-year, $150.815 million extension (beginning after the \'23 season) this offseason.     ', 'Stephen A. Smith calls Rodgers\' performance ""shameful"" after Packers\' blowout loss against Saints  Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers suffered a 38-3 blowout loss against the New Orleans Saints in Week 1 of the 2021 season. No one saw this defeat coming.  Rodgers has perhaps already had his worst game of the year in Week 1. He went 15/28 for only 133 yards and two interceptions as the offense never got going.        Jameis Winston, on the other hand, was stellar, throwing for five touchdowns and 148 passing yards on the way to routing the Packers.           Stephen A. Smith tears Rodgers apart It was indeed a challenging game to watch for Packers fans and one of the team\'s most famous fans, Stephen A. Smith, gave a damning verdict on the reigning MVP\'s performance. Smith called it ""the most shameful performance of Aaron Rodgers\' career"" and even went as far as saying the quarterback didn\'t care about the game or the outcome. Smith did not stop there. He added that the performance was ""atrocious"" and ""embarrassing"" for Rodgers. ""That was the most atrocious performance of [Aaron Rodgers\'] career. He was so awful that embarrassing doesn\'t even begin to describe it.""@stephenasmith calls Sunday\'s game against the Saints the ""most shameful performance of Aaron Rodgers\' career."" 😶 pic.twitter.com/J72NWKlhI8— First Take (@FirstTake) September 13, 2021     Smith not only ripped into Rodgers but also went after head coach Matt LaFleur. Smith said that LeFluer did not have the team prepared adequately, and given it was the opening game of the year, that should not be happening. Even though the Packers are still well and truly in the running to win the division, this type of loss could have long-lasting effects on the team. Rodgers played so poorly on Sunday that the much-maligned Jordan Love was given snaps after the former MVP was benched. Now, this is more likely to do with the fact that the scoreline was already out of hand, and the Packers didn\'t have much to lose. Then there are the Saints. Clearly, without Drew Brees, they will not be the offensive powerhouse they have been in the past few years, but they can still pack a punch with wideout Michael Thomas. Jameis Winston looked as good as ever, but most are still unsure exactly where the Saints sit in the NFC race, unlike the Packers, who many believe will be there come the postseason. However, after a result like this, questions have to be asked, and the fact that a performance like this happened in Week 1 is troubling.     Despite the poor outing, it is only one game, and the Packers will look to get back on the winners\' list next week when they face the Detroit Lions.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 2 TV Schedule     ', ""3 worst games of Aaron Rodgers' career with the Packers  Aaron Rodgers has been one of the best quarterbacks for the Green Bay Packers for the majority of his long-standing career. On top of being the glue that has held the Packers together for his 15-plus years on the team, he boasts a 3x MVP record on top of a 3x passer rating record.  Both those records included the 2020 season when it seemed like the Packers could not be stopped. Being the best at something doesn't necessarily mean that doesn't come with bad days, though. Has Aaron Rodgers had worse outings in a Green Bay shirt than the Week 1 performance against the Saints? After last Sunday's atrocious performance, here's a look at Aaron Rodgers' worst performances with the Packers.        Down but not out: The best of Rodgers' most non-Rodgers-esque performances in a Green Bay shirt            #1 Green Bay Packers vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Sept 28, 2008 Aaron Rodgers could not seem to get anything going during the game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers back in 2008. Rodgers has only thrown three picks in a game three times in his career. This was one of those games. The Bucs defense was relentless. On top of Rodgers throwing three interceptions, he barely completed half of his attempts. A 14-27 completion day is not an Aaron Rodgers day. The star quarterback was sacked three times in that game as well. Rodgers' passer rating that day was 55.9 and his QBR was 13.4. The Bucs defense included notable names like Aqib Talib and Ronde Barber. The defense amounted to three sacks and two defensive TDs.     #2 Green Bay Packers vs Buffalo Bills, Dec 14, 2014 Rodgers had an even worse game when the Packers took on the Buffalo Bills in December 2014. Usually, that is when the Packers are in full-blown playoff mode, but Rodgers couldn't escape the pressure from the Bills. Rodgers had only thrown three interceptions the entire season before the game. The Bills' resolute defense led Rodgers to add two more interceptions to his season total. Rodgers also only completed 17-42 pass attempts that night. His embarrassing passer rating was 34.3 and his QBR was an all-time low of 12.4. The Bills defense amounted to one sack, two tackles for loss, 10 QB hits and one defensive touchdown. Notable names Stephon Gilmore, Mario Williams and Baccari Rambo made sure Rodgers felt their presence that day. #3 Green Bay Packers vs New Orleans Saints, Sep 12, 2021 This takes the list to Rodgers' worst game to date. The New Orleans Saints embarrassed the Packers worse than anyone ever has with Rodgers at the helm.     Rodgers did not seem to look like his usual self in Week 1 this year.

"", 'Anthony Davis reveals conversation with Green Bay Packers\' Aaron Rodgers fuelled his performance once again: ""Hey, AD, man, I need thirty tonight""  Anthony Davis just dominated for the LA Lakers against the Milwaukee Bucks’ twin-tower combo of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Brook Lopez. AD, who was unquestionably the best player in the game, finished with 44 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and three blocks.  After the game, he told the media of the familiar inspiration for his recent monster performances over the past three weeks:        “You guys know how I feel about the Pack [Green Bay Packers and him [Aaron Rodgers] so seen him before the game, ‘Hey, AD, man, I need thirty tonight.’ He say I want 30, not 40 [laughs]. It’s always good for him to come out here and watch the Lakers play, watch me play. He’s a fan, I’m a fan of his.”      Spectrum SportsNet@SpectrumSN.@AntDavis23 (44 PTS, 10 REB, 4 AST, 3 BLK) spoke post-game about the #Lakers team effort and setting the tone for the road trip.27737.@AntDavis23 (44 PTS, 10 REB, 4 AST, 3 BLK) spoke post-game about the #Lakers team effort and setting the tone for the road trip. https://t.co/EMV6ZsRjjl     Anthony Davis is from Chicago and is supposedly a Chicago Bears fan, but has been a loyal follower of Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers. Over the years, he’s credited the superstar quarterback for giving him the inspiration to dominate the NBA. Rodgers’ magic words certainly worked tonight as the Bucks, even with Antetokounmpo and Lopez around, were hardly able to contain Davis. AD shot 18-27 from the field, including numerous timely baskets that kept Milwaukee at bay throughout the game. Besides causing trouble for the Bucks on offense, Anthony Davis was also the Lakers’ lynchpin on defense. Not many can make Giannis Antetokounmpo hesitate when he drives to the basket, but Davis certainly did that on a few occasions. Over the last three weeks, AD has reminded everyone in the NBA that he’s arguably the best player in the league when healthy and engaged. Davis, if he can sustain this performance, should unquestionably be a hot name in the MVP race.      Anthony Davis took what the Milwaukee Bucks gave him The Milwaukee Bucks threw everything at Anthony Davis and the Lakers superstar still dominated. The biggest criticism during Anthony Davis’ rampaging run has been the lack of interior presence to keep him from dominating. Against the Bucks, Davis faced arguably the NBA’s premiere inside stoppers in Giannis Antetokounmpo and Brook Lopez. “The Greek Freak” is a former Defensive Player of the Year winner and is probably the game’s most versatile defender. Milwaukee also has Lopez, who is making a strong case for being the best defender in the NBA this season.     Here’s what Anthony Davis had to say about how he attacked the Milwaukee Bucks’ defense: “I’m always confident in every shot that I take. Just knowing how they play, Brook [Lopez] being down on the floor, Giannis [Antetokounmpo] being down on the floor, it wasn’t probably going to be a get-to-the-rim game, so just trying to shoot over the top. And then after you make a couple, they start to close out.”         Davis’ jumper has deservedly been maligned over the past two years. He was so bad that opponents weren’t even going to contest him around the perimeter. At the start of the season, AD mentioned having a little problem with his wrist and that he was thinking too much about his shot.Anthony Davis has figured it out and is looking unstoppable even with the best defenders arrayed against him.     ', '""Aaron Rodgers is washed, as in defunct"" - Skip Bayless believes Packers QB is finished after loss vs. Titans  Four days after defeating the Dallas Cowboys, Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers lost to the Tennessee Titans 39-24 on Thursday night. Although the 38-year-old quarterback was able to stage a comeback on Sunday against Dallas, that wasn\'t the case on Thursday night at Lambeau Field.  On Friday morning, Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe discussed the Packers and Rodgers on FOX Sports\' Undisputed.        Bayless said that after the game, he felt that Rodgers is now \'washed up\'. He thought that after the win over the Cowboys, perhaps the Packers would go on a run, but just four days later, they appeared to be done.           ""I am here to officially announce that Aaron Rodgers is washed up, as in defunct, as in after the game. I have never seen him so humble. As in humbled. Yeah. As in resigned to his fate. Oh, no player knows what just happened. Yeah, it just ended right before his very eyes. And for once he was saying, \'I just couldn\'t make the throws. I don\'t know why. I just couldn\'t make them\', he said. ""After the Dallas game on Sunday evening, I felt like I threw the ball just about exactly where I wanted to against the Dallas Cowboys. So, Mr. Sharp, yes. As you well know, I see the NFL world through the metallic blue prism of the Dallas Cowboys.""     Bayless noted Rodgers\' observation about not being able to make the throws on Thursday night against the Titans. This was just days after he found rookie wide receiver Christian Watson in the end zone three times. It was also days after he was able to give running back Aaron Jones the ball time after time to run all over the Cowboys.

The Eagles have just one loss, which came on Monday night against the Washington Commanders. The likelihood of the Packers figuring things out again in time to face the Eagles is doubtful. Green Bay is now 4-7, four games behind first-place Minnesota Vikings in the NFC North. ESPN analyst calls for Packers to trade Aaron Rodgers The Packers are 4-7 and Aaron Rodgers doesn\'t appear to be the same quarterback who has won the NFL MVP in the last two seasons. Although he said after the loss to the Titans that they can power through and win the last six games, that is a tall task.         ESPN analyst Bart Scott said on ESPN\'s First Take, on Friday morning, that he still believes that the Green Bay Packers should trade quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Scott suggested that the Packers should have parted ways with the quarterback before they signed him to a lucrative contract extension this offseason. ""I said this about a week ago on this show, they should trade him. And you look at what the Denver Broncos got for Russell Wilson. This is a failure on all levels. Mark Murphy, Matt LaFleur, and then I put Aaron Rodgers responsible third. Because if you\'re going to double down on Aaron Rodgers, it is no way you allow Davonte Adams to leave that building.""

This could be another reason why Green Bay has been ineffective this season.

Ever since it was revealed that the New York Jets quarterback is a massive ""Swiftie"" as they\'re called, it\'s all anyone can talk about.  On The Pat McAfee Show, the team discussed Swift\'s recently-reported split from the 1975 frontman Matty Healy, who she allegedly dated in the wake of her breakup with actor Joe Alwyn.                     McAfee said: ""Matt Healy, who I saw kissing a security guard at his concert I believe just like two days ago. Public, very public kiss on a man\'s face. So now, Taylor, gonna write an album I assume about Mr. Healy and this tour is just going to go on to do $10 billion and just maybe never stop. Is she gonna be able to tour forever? What does Taylor Swift do next, AJ Hawk?""     Hawk, who played with Rodgers in Green Bay, suggested the two should meet up: ""What does she do? I don\'t know. She had a high profile quarterback go to at least two of her three shows."" This was met with a raucous response, and McAfee prodded further. Hawk continued: ""I\'m saying he should throw his name in the hat. Let her know he\'s interested.""        McAfee added: ""Bro, he\'s got too many favorite songs to just list of one or two from Taylor Swift as he was jogging off field the other day on Friday at the end of the OTAs. He said, \'Is there another Taylor Swift concert this weekend at MetLife?\' He does seem to be a little bit uh, tripping b*lls."" Hawk seems to want them to get together since they are both single.  Aaron Rodgers is a massive fan of Taylor Swift As is the unfortunate custom in today\'s society, odds have been placed on who Swift will date next.

Just like almost any other year, the Green Bay Packers took the lead early and coasted for the rest of the contest. But after trading Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders and the subsequent Week 1 loss, there are still some questions being asked of them.  It\'s going to take more than a victory against the Chicago Bears to get Stephen A. Smith to take notice. Speaking on First Take, he effectively wrote off the performance. Here\'s how he put it:        ""You\'re going against the Chicago Bears. If they were going up against a better team, I would feel more enthused about what I saw. But the fact that it was against the Chicago Bears, who clearly ain\'t ready, okay? They are in rebuilding mode whether they want to tell us or not. That\'s why I\'m not that excited about what I saw.""                  The Bears have had an odd start to the season and now stand at 1-1. Despite a surprise win during difficult weather conditions against the San Francsico 49ers, they\'ve not looked great on offense. They don\'t have the best weapons for Justin Fields to throw at and many have already written them off. Defeating Chicago was thus expected of Aaron Rodgers and it wasn\'t enough to silence his critics. Aaron Rodgers\' up-and-down start for the Packers Green Bay Packers v Minnesota Vikings     Aaron Rodgers started the 2022 season with a 23-7 loss against division rivals the Minnesota Vikings. He completed 64.7 percent of his passes for 195 yards, zero touchdowns and an interception. On Sunday Night Football, the Packers cruised to victory over the Bears with a score of 27-10. Rodgers completed 19 of 25 throws for 234 yards and two touchdowns in the victory. The Packers led 24-7 at the half and coasted through the second half.    Next week will be a tougher test for Green Bay. They will travel to face Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Buccaneers are 2-0 and this could well be an early teaser of an NFC playoff match.

But with the team going downhill at 4-7, Rodgers, who was a guest on the Pat McAfee Show in his weekly spot, isn\'t using his thumb injury as an excuse.

Green Bay will likely have to beat the 9-1 Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday Night Football to keep their hopes alive.    For most, sitting at 4-7 is season over.

36,Russell Wilson,"[""Russell Wilson's career stats: How poorly is Broncos QB performing compared to his Seahawks days?  Russell Wilson's career stats have been excellent as a whole since he entered the NFL prior to the start of the 2012 season. He has now spent more than a decade as a starting quarterback in the league. He has pretty consistently been one of the best overall players at his position during his generation of football.  Russell Wilson's place among elite quarterbacks in the NFL became widely accepted during nearly his entire ten years with the Seattle Seahawks. The 2022 NFL season marks his first with a new team since joining the Denver Broncos during the offseason via trade. Here is how Russell Wilson's career stats have played out during his NFL journey.        Russell Wilson's career stats with the Seattle Seahawks           Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson Russell Wilson was selected with the 75th overall pick in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft by the Seattle Seahawks. He was initially projected to serve as their backup quarterback, while possibly one day developing into a potential starting quarterback. Wilson was so impressive during training camp and the preseason during his rookie year that he immediately won the starting job. Head coach Pete Carroll's decision turned out to be the right one as Wilson made an instant impact.         Russell Wilson started every game for the Seahawks during his first nine years with the team. He posted a winning record in all nine of them, while making it to the NFL Playoffs eight times. He also helped the Seahawks make two Super Bowl appearances and won the ring in one of them. Russell Wilson's career stats were consistently solid with the Seahawks. He recorded, at least, 20 touchdown passes in all of his ten seasons with the Seahawks. He exceeded 30 touchdowns five times. He also surpassed 3,000 passing yards in all ten seasons, while eclipsing 4,000 passing yards four times. He has also completed, at least, 61 percent of his passes in every season of his career.     Russell Wilson's career stats: Denver Broncos Denver Broncos QB Russell Wilson Russell Wilson is having the worst statistical season of his career in his first year with the Denver Broncos. He currently has a career-low 57.4 completion percentage at the conclusion of Week 10. He has thrown just seven touchdown passes in his first eight games.     Wilson is currently on pace to throw just 14 touchdown passes during the 2022 NFL season. This could be a new career low. He is also on pace to throw ten interceptions. This would be the fourth-most in any season of his career. Russell Wilson's career stats have certainly taken a hit this year, but he still has time to potentially turn things around.

"", 'Broncos should regret Wilson trade following MNF performance  The Denver Broncos shocked the NFL world when the team announced that they were acquiring Nine-time Pro Bowl quarterback Russell Wilson in a trade this offseason.  Unfortunately for Denver, their new quarterback hasn\'t been the player they bargained for. After an atrocious second-half performance against the Chargers on Monday Night Football, Wilson proved to be true once more.        Over the last handful of seasons, fans league-wide have described the Broncos as a team one [franchise] quarterback away from being a legitimate contender. With the acquisition of Russell Wilson, who\'s earned an All-Pro selection as well as a Super Bowl ring, Denver finally grabbed the quarterback needed to take the next step.           Or so the team thought. The hype around Denver\'s new roster was massive, adding Wilson to a team that has already fielded a fantastic defense. Fans were ready for Russ to \'cook\', and even began chanting ""Let\'s Ride"" as the team rode into the regular season. The Broncos\' defense has lived up to expectations, surrendering the third-lowest number of yards per game in addition to the fourth-least points. While the defense is proving to be exactly as advertised, the new quarterback in town has been nothing short of disappointing. Over the course of the season, Wilson has found himself with 5 passing touchdowns (T23), an 82.3 quarterback rating (23), and the fifth-lowest completion percentage in the NFL.     As bad as those numbers are, they\'re fantastic compared to what Wilson posted in the second-half of his most recent game on Monday, where the 33-year-old went three-for-eleven with 15 passing yards and a quarterback rating of 39.6; a rating equivalent to throwing the ball into the dirt on every snap. Jeff Kerr@JeffKerrCBSRussell Wilson was 3-of-11 for 15 yards and 0 TD in the second half and OT. 39.6 rating. The #Broncos gave Wilson $124 million guaranteed. #BroncosCountry36085Russell Wilson was 3-of-11 for 15 yards and 0 TD in the second half and OT. 39.6 rating. The #Broncos gave Wilson $124 million guaranteed. #BroncosCountry This is only the latest disappointing performance from a player Denver traded a king\'s ransom to acquire. That being the case, it\'s almost safe to say that the Broncos made a mistake trading for Wilson - a huge mistake that may linger for years.      The Broncos should be regretting the Russell Wilson trade while Seattle celebrates Denver Broncos v Las Vegas Raiders Getting the Seahawks to agree to terms with a trade for Wilson was no light task. In the end, it took Drew Lock, Shelby Harris, Noah Fant, two first-round draft picks (\'22, \'23) and two second-round draft picks (\'22, \'23). The Broncos also tossed a fourth-rounder in the 2022 NFL Draft, while Seattle gave up an additional \'22 fifth-round pick.     To put it bluntly, this is shaping up to be one of the worst trades of the decade. There\'s nothing to show Russ\' worth throughout the six weeks of the season. The numbers are bad, and so is the 2-4 record Denver now has. Even with an offensive line that ranks eighth in PFF\'s latest rankings, Wilson is unable to do much of anything. The situation is even worse when you factor in the five-year, $245 million extension Wilson received following the trade. In fact, this means Russell Wilson and the Denver Broncos will be conjoined for some time; seven years, in fact. On the other hand, the Seahawks are thriving with their new additions. Both Shelby Harris and Noah Fant are starters in Seattle, just as they would be for the Broncos. These two players have earned a PFF grade north of 70 in the early portion of the year, while Wilson finds himself under 60.     Right off the bat, this means Denver traded two starting-caliber players for Russell Wilson, who both continue to play great football with their new team. The \'22 first-round draft pick shipped to Seattle happened to be the ninth-overall pick. With such a high selection, Denver could\'ve got a stud regardless of which direction they wanted to travel in. For the Seahawks, they went with OT Charles Cross. Cross has earned a 64.6 grade in pass blocking at his left tackle position, allowing 14 pressures through six contests. We can\'t forget Drew Lock, either. While he might seem insignificant in this trade, don\'t underestimate the value of a backup quarterback. Some coaches even go as far as saying the starting quarterback of a team is the most important player, and the QB2 is the second-most important. The real kick in the face here is Geno Smith, who took over as Seattle\'s quarterback following the Russell Wilson trade.     Geno is severely outplaying Wilson. While Russ has recorded the fifth-lowest completion percentage in the NFL, Smith is currently the league-leader. On top of that, Smith has the third-highest quarterback rating; a ranking much different than Wilson\'s 23rd.Perhaps the Broncos can fix things down the road, but for now, the Russell Wilson trade remains one of the most one-sided deals over the last handful of years. Wilson\'s atrocious second-half performance on Monday night only helped solidify that.

While social media had hilarious jokes about the veteran quarterback\'s rough game, NFL Hall of Famer Eli Manning delivered the most brutal assessment of his performance with an epic zinger on ManningCast.  While discussing the game between the Broncos and 49ers with his brother, Peyton Manning, and retired punter-turned-analyst-commentator-broadcaster Pat McAfee on ManningCast, Eli said:        ""They should\'ve paid that punter $235 million instead of Russell [Wilson].""

The 2022 off-season pickup by the Broncos punted the ball ten times for 476 yards against the 49ers.     More importantly, six of his ten punts landed inside the 49ers\' 20-yard line, which proved crucial. One of his punts was fielded by his teammates at the 49ers\' 2-yard line, and just two plays later, the Broncos defense forced a safety, which cut their deficit to two.

Wilson attempted 28 passes and completed only 15 for 188 passing yards against a Chargers defense that ranked 31st in the league in points allowed.

The Broncos gave up three players and five picks for the former Seattle Seahawks quarterback, only to see his replacement in Seattle outplay him so far this season. Wilson is on the Broncos\' books until the 2028 NFL season. If the quarterback fails to turn around this poor form, the team will face the horror of having to field an aging and declining signal-caller for multiple seasons, who is realistically untradeable due to the size of his contract.     The Broncos will likely not pull the plug on Wilson this early in his tenure as a member of their roster. They will exercise patience and exhaust every option before benching the quarterback or cutting ties via a trade or release.But given the size of his contract and the fact that they have traded their top two picks in the 2023 and 2024 NFL drafts to the Seahawks, it will be tough for the Broncos to field more talent around Russell Wilson than they currently do.It\'s not looking good in Mile High.     ', 'Panthers star admits he couldn’t resist mocking Russell Wilson during yet another abysmal performance by Broncos QB  The Carolina Panthers overwhelmed Russell Wilson and the Denver Broncos all day on Sunday. They dominated, winning 23-10 with the Broncos\' only points coming off a muffed punt near the red zone and a garbage-time touchdown late in the fourth quarter with the result decided.  During the second quarter, star defensive end Brian Burns registered one of his two sacks on the day (part of a 10-sack effort on the season). He then proceeded to celebrate with with his arms out wide.        Fans quickly assumed he was trolling Wilson\'s penchant for praying in the middle of the field. The Broncos quarterback infamously and awkwardly stood with cameras around him in the middle of the field before the game in London and this looked like an imitation.

I\'m a little petty... It\'s all in fun and games, you know, no disrespect to Russ."" Wilson recorded another frustrating stat line with 19/35 completions for just 142 yards and a touchdown. Denver Broncos v Tennessee Titans     The Broncos fell to 3-8 and moved closer to a high draft pick. Unfortunately, they won\'t get one since they traded their first two picks in the 2023 draft to Seattle in exchange for Wilson.  Will the Panthers extend Brian Burns? Burns has anchored what has been a surprisingly solid defense. Even amidst the firing of their head coach and defensive coordinator, that unit is strong. Burns is. a big reason for that.        The Panthers reportedly turned down a massive deal from the Los Angeles Rams that included two first-round picks, so there\'s almost no chance he enters free agency when his contract ends following next season.We will have to wait and see what happens in this scenario.

Just last season, the team won the NFC West and hosted a playoff game in which they lost to the Rams 30-20. But things can quickly change in the National Football League.        On Sunday, the Seahawks lost to the lowly Chicago Bears by a score of 25-24 after leading by 10 points in the third quarter. During the game, there was a key blunder by Russell Wilson, which head coach Pete Carroll was certain to address after the game.           Gregg Bell@gbellseattlePete Carroll on Russell Wilson taking a sack on 3rd down from CHI 8 in 4Q with Seahawks up 7, just before Myers missed 39-yard field goal: “We’ve got to get rid of the ball.

We can’t take a sack there.” @thenewstribune https://t.co/v8EgskDW2f  Seattle Seahawks v Las Vegas Raiders     Russell Wilson\'s blunder costs Seahawks precious lead With 7:18 remaining in Sunday\'s game, Russell Wilson took a sack on third down while driving into the Bears\' territory. The sack forced Seahawks kicker Jason Myers to attempt a 39-yard field goal, which he missed. If the kick had been successful, the Seahawks would have held a 10-point lead along with the likely momentum. Instead, the momentum switched over to Chicago and they ended up driving to eventually score the game-winning touchdown. After the game, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll made some rather scathing comments about his star quarterback taking a critical sack: “That’s a situation right there that did give them a chance to shift it and the momentum of it. In that situation, that third down in field goal range to go up by 10, we gotta get rid of the football. We can’t take [a] sack there, and we gotta look at what happened on that play again.""     “But that’s what I’m talking about,"" Carroll continued, ""and I got to get that done. I got to get him [Wilson] to execute that way. I got to get Russ to pull that off. I got to get the coaches to make sure we reminded him well enough so that that didn’t happen. That’s [when] you sail it out of the endzone right there, kick the field goal. I don’t know what yard line we’re on but yeah. I mean, so as short as you can get on a field goal so that’s as makable as it can be."" “Now, we got to hit the field goal too, but that’s part of the thinking and the mentality that we practiced that stuff all the time and we just didn’t do it. And that was a clear situation where we gave them an opportunity to get some momentum from us,” Carroll finished.

The Broncos quarterback missed wide receiver K.J. Hamler, who looked to be open on the final play of the game. Instead, Wilson threw an incomplete pass and Denver were consigned to defeat. Hamler was upset and slammed his helmet onto the turf in frustration.        Thus far, the 2-3 start to the 2022 season is not what Denver fans envisioned.

How long will it take to know if Russell Wilson is a bust? Russell Wilson     Most expect the answer to the quarterback\'s future by the end of the first quarter of the season. By the end of the first four games, it will be clear whether the team needs to restart their quarterback carousel or if the quarterback duo with Sean Payton will work.    Last season, some fans began losing hope after the Week 2 loss to the Houston Texans, but it was undeniable by the end of a 12-9 loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Oct. 6.

', 'Ron Rivera buries Carson Wentz, claims QB reason why other NFC East are ahead of the Commanders  Ron Rivera did not mince words as he threw Carson Wentz under the bus as the reason for the Washington Commanders\' poor performance this season. Rivera was asked why he believes the other teams in the NFC East have done better than the Commanders this season. Rivera\'s :  Rivera said, ""Quarterback.""        The Commanders are marooned at the bottom of the division with a 1-4 record. The Philadelphia Eagles lead the division 5-0 followed by the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants with identical 4-1 records. The Washington Commanders are the only team with a losing record in that division this season and by some margin.

His one-word answer was straight to the point -- quarterback. He squarely laid the blame at the feet of Carson Wentz.      His follow-up clarification, when it was put to him that the Commanders had traded for their chosen quarterback this season, was not the vote of confidence any quarterback would want to hear. ""No, I got no regrets about the quarterback. I think our quarterback has done some good things; there\'s been a couple of games he\'s struggled."" It was not something Carson Wentz would have expected to hear from his coach and whether his standing recovers with Ron Rivera and the locker room remains to be seen. Carson Wentz\'s performances this season Tennessee Titans v Washington Commanders     In the first game of the season against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Carson Wentz gave a fair account of himself as he had four touchdowns for 313 yards. However, that 28-22 win also disguised the fact that he threw two interceptions in the game that a better team than the Jaguars would have taken advantage of. In the second game, he threw for three touchdowns and one interception for 337 yards as they lost to the Detroit Lions 36-27. He also got sacked five times. This weakness would explode into full view in the next game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

But he was sacked a scarcely believable nine times, which showed his lack of common sense in setting up the offense and getting the ball off quickly. His performance dropped again in their Week 4 loss to the Dallas Cowboys (25-10) as he threw for only 170 yards and had two interceptions for only one touchdown. In both the second and the third games, his completion rate dipped below 60%. This week, even though they lost to the Tennessee Titans (21-17), there was a slight improvement. There was still one interception and three sacks, even though Wentz did contribute two touchdowns. Carson Wentz\'s interception on third-and-goal also extinguished any chances of a win in that game. This happened when there were only six seconds remaining in the game.

', '\xa0""It\'s coaching malpractice to leave this bum in"" - NFL fans react to Carson Wentz\'s miserable performance vs. Browns as Commanders season ends  Carson Wentz was officially named the starting quarterback for the Washington Commanders in Week 17 of the 2022 NFL season against the Cleveland Browns. He will be making his first start since Week 6 against the Chicago Bears when he suffered an injury. While he had previously been medically cleared to play, Taylor Heinicke continued serving as the starting quarterback.  The decision by head coach Ron Rivera and the Commanders organization to return to Carson Wentz as their starting quarterback was a bit of a controversial one. He recorded just a 2-4 record in the first six weeks of the season prior to going down with an injury. Taylor Heinicke helped the Commanders firmly establish themselves as playoff contenders.        Heinicke\'s success was the main reason why they stuck with him as their starting quarterback, despite Wentz being medically cleared to return. The Commanders entered Week 17 in a crucial situation for their playoff hopes. A win against the Browns would put them in control of their own destiny in making the playoffs, while a loss would all but eliminate them from contention.           The magnitude of their Week 17 matchup is what made it so surprising that the Commanders decided to make a change at quarterback. They decided to go with the quarterback who struggled earlier in the season, rather than the one that helped get them back in the playoff race. It was a bold decision, and it epically backfired.         Carson Wentz turned in a disastrous performance as the Commander lost 24-10 to the Browns. He threw for just 143 yards and failed to throw for a touchdown, while also committing three crucial interceptions that basically lost them the game. He has now thrown six interceptions this year in just seven starts.  NFL fans quickly went on Twitter to react to the miserable performance, as well as the shocking decision to start Carson Wentz in the first place, given all the circumstances surrounding it.

Washington Commanders QB Carson Wentz     While the Commanders\' plans are unclear at this point, they have an opportunity to move on from Carson Wentz during the 2023 NFL offseason if they so choose. With the way his current contract is constructed, they have the ability to cut him off from their roster without any dead cap money counting against them. His disastrous 2022 NFL season may give them a good reason to move on from him with no financial penalty.    If the Commaders do, in fact, move on from Wentz in 2023, they will likely have several potential options to replace him. They selected Sam Howell in the 2022 NFL Draft and several other quarterbacks could be available as well. Some of the possible names include Derek Carr, Tom Brady, Jimmy Garoppolo, Sam Darnold, and Baker Mayfield.     ', ""NFL Rumors: Former Super Bowl winning QB tipped to join Packers as veteran to assist Jordan Love  The Green Bay Packers are indeed in need of quarterback depth behind Jordan Love after the departure of Aaron Rodgers. With Rodgers joining the New York Jets, the Packers are entering a new era and are looking to solidify their quarterback position for the future.  Currently, the Packers have limited options behind Love. Danny Etling, who has minimal playing experience, and rookie Sean Clifford are the other quarterbacks on the roster. While Clifford has shown promise during his time at Penn State, the Packers may not view him as an immediate solution or someone they have much confidence in at this point.        Thus, CBS Sports' Cody Benjamin claims that the Packers are looking towards signing veteran Carson Wentz. Wentz, who won Super Bowl LII with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2017-18, is currently without a team after being released from the Washington Commanders at the end of the 2022-23 season.            How did Carson Wentz fare in 2022? A look at his only season with the Washington Commanders Carson Wentz had a disastrous 2022 season as a Commander     Carson Wentz's performance since Super Bowl LII has indeed been inconsistent, and he has struggled to replicate the form that made the Philadelphia Eagles successful. After the Super Bowl win, Wentz faced several challenges, including injuries and changes in team dynamics. In the 2022 season, after being traded from the Indianapolis Colts to the Washington Commanders, there were expectations for Wentz to lead the team to the postseason. In his debut with the Commanders, he had a strong performance, throwing for 313 yards and four touchdowns against two interceptions. However, the Commanders lost their next four, the nadir being a Week 3 8-24 rout at Wentz's old home in Philly, wherein David Long Jr. intercepted him at the endzone to seal the game. They did defeat the Chicago Bears on Week 6, but Wentz broke a right finger. He did not return to the field until Week 15, when he relieved Taylor Heinicke during a 20-37 loss at the San Francisco 49ers. He was named the starter for the Commanders' last two games, which were vital to their playoff hopes.However, they lost the first of them at home against the Cleveland Browns, and Wentz was benched for rookie Sam Howell for the season finale, a 26-6 victory at the Dallas Cowboys. He was released at the end of the season, with two years left on his contract.

While it was undoubtedly a poor performance, the numbers show that Wentz has been far from poor this season. He entered the match with seven touchdowns, the joint lead in the league. He remains tied with Jared Goff and Justin Herbert after the match and trails only Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and Tua Tagovailoa in the league. Understandably, though, it will be scant consolation for the Washington Commanders fans after falling to 1-2 on the season, with the offense spluttering.     Furthermore, it must be noted that Wentz's pocket presence has always been something that could be improved. Much of the Eagles team that played with him would have realized this and that is why they bring pressure so often on him. His last worst performance in terms of sacks was 8 when he was playing for the Eagles and came against Washington, so the team were aware of his weaknesses. As always, we attach too much to single performances, but one must now admit to some glaring inadequacies of the quarterback that have persisted over the years. A win would certainly help improve the situation, but the next game against old rivals Dallas is certainly not the easiest place to get your season back on track. The Cowboys already have 8 team sacks this season and will be looking to add to that.     "", ""Carson Wentz's net worth: How much is the ex-commanders QB worth in 2023?

Carson Wentz had an average 2022 season in which he performed below expectations as a member of the Washington Commanders, which expected to make the postseason due to the strength of their existing roster with the addition of an elite NFL starting quarterback in Wentz.  However, they finished at the bottom of the NFC East, becoming the only side in the division not to make the postseason.Wentz put up a stat line of 1,755 passing yards, 11 touchdowns, and nine interceptions in eight games for the Commanders. He gave the team no other option than to release him, and they did just that in the opening weeks of the 2023 offseason.     "", ""Is Carson Wentz playing tonight vs Ravens in Week 5?  Will he or won't he play? For Carson Wentz, this has been the main talking point about the quarterback since early August. Thus far, his availability for games has been a constant source of confusion and stress.  Will the quarterback be playing tonight in Monday Night Football or has he finally succumbed to the avalanche of injuries?

Carson Wentz is not listed on the Colts' injury report, according to CBS Sports. He is expected to be fully available for Monday Night Football. The quarterback should play all four quarters, barring unforeseen in-game events. This is great news for the 1-3 Colts looking for their first win streak of the season after coming off a 27-17 win over the Miami Dolphins.

It started paying off in building core roster w/expectations after adding Carson Wentz. But....-Nonstop injuries-Wentz still finding his way in changing his styleNow Indy has to play catch up w/winsespn.com/blog/indianapo… If Carson Wentz wasn't able to play, the Colts would have had to go with Brett Hundley. Hundley is a journeyman quarterback who has spent time with the Cardinals and Packers over the last five years. His career win-loss record of 3-6 with more interceptions than touchdowns in the NFL. Needless to say, starting Hundley for Monday Night Football could have been a nightmare for Colts fans. However, with Wentz starting and coming off a solid performance against the Dolphins, the Colts have a shot to give Baltimore a run for their money. Last week, Wentz threw for 228 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. He also completed a season-high 75 percent of his throws.         Considering the Ravens' 24th-ranked pass defense, Wentz could have another solid game. If the quarterback has a great day, the Ravens could be in for a tough game. However, the Colts have their own injury issues outside of Carson Wentz to overcome. TY Hilton, JJ Nelson, and Quenton Nelson will not be playing in this game. TY Hilton's absence combined with Quenton Nelson's injury hampers the Colts' ability to throw the ball deep. First, the Colts will need a top receiver to stretch the defense without Hilton. Secondly, the offensive line needs to give Wentz time as he waits for other receiver routes to develop.     Seattle Seahawks v Indianapolis ColtsEssentially, the Colts will need to keep the game close for four quarters in order to win. If they need to throw deep, they could be in trouble. For a quarterback with Wentz's injury history, it is doubly imperative that the Colts protect Wentz and play well in tonight's game.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 6 TV Schedule     ""]"

But, it appears that he hasn\'t fully given up on his ability to play in the National Football League as of yet.

', '""Got no time to waste, every opportunity could be the last one"" - LA Lakers\' new recruit speaks out after making big statement against Golden State Warriors in preseason win  LA Lakers\' most recent acquisition, Matt Ryan, put on a solid shooting display in the fourth quarter against the Golden State Warriors. Ryan only played during the fourth quarter and wasted no time sinking in consecutive 3-point shots.   After the game concluded, Lakers reporter Mike Trudell initiated a post-game interview with Matt Ryan. As a new player on the roster, Trudell curiously asked what Ryan\'s mindset was after finally securing an opportunity.        ""For a player of my position, it\'s just staying ready for an opportunity and try to make the most of it whenever it comes,"" Ryan said. ""Got no time to waste, every opportunity could be the last one.""      Trudell also wanted to talk about Ryan\'s shooting and how he felt playing in front of LeBron James and Stephen Curry. ""I love it! I knew I was shooting well, and I just needed to keep shooting,"" Ryan said. ""I\'m very fortunate and thankful to get another opportunity tonight after having a couple of off-games."" In the first two preseason games with the LA Lakers, Matt Ryan wasn\'t exactly performing well. He finally got his shot at redemption last night, proving he can sink in shots. Ryan scored 20 points, dropping in 6 out of 9 shots from deep. If he can deliver performances like this one in the regular season, the Lakers may often have a deadly sharpshooter to utilize.

Anthony Davis led the team to victory, defeating the Golden State Warriors 124-121. Neither team was in full force. The only All-Stars playing was AD and Steph Curry. Nevertheless, it was still an impressive victory for LA as they showed what they could do even without LeBron James and Russell Westbrook playing. Anthony Davis proved last night that he\'s still capable of carrying his team. He dominated every quarter he played, sinking in some 3-point shots, mid-range jumpers, and finishing lob passes. Davis scored 28 points and had three rebounds and three assists in 21 minutes of play.  Although it was a close matchup, the Warriors had more star power in their lineup compared to the Lakers. Aside from Steph Curry, Golden State also had Andrew Wiggins and Jordan Poole in the mix. It was an impressive showing by the Lakers\' role players. They stepped up to the occasion of dethroning the defending champs.     Kendrick Nunn has been an asset for the LA Lakers since returning from an 11-month injury. Last night, he put up 21 points, seven assists and four rebounds. Nunn effectively created his own shots and stunned the Warriors with his stop-and-pop shooting. It might be too early, but if the LA Lakers can keep up performances like this, we might see the team accomplish a comeback season.       ', ""3 NFL Quarterbacks who should be benched after horrible Week 2 performances to start the 2022 season  Week 2 of the 2022 NFL season has been completed, and though it has only been two games so far, some quarterbacks already appear to be in the hot seat. Poor performances by a quarterback can completely derail a team's season, so it's important for franchises to be quick and decisive about their most crucial position.  Team expectations, back-up quarterback situations, and individual performances all play major roles in the decision to keep a struggling quarterback on the field. Here are three quarterbacks who are in danger of being benched after Week 2 of the 2022 NFL season.        #1 - Matt Ryan, Indianapolis Colts            Indianapolis Colts QB Matt Ryan The Indianapolis Colts finished the 2021 NFL season with a major disappointment after missing the playoffs. This led the organization to make changes at quarterback, trading away Carson Wentz and acquiring Matt Ryan to take over the job. The early signs that have been shown are not at all what the Colts were hoping for.         The Colts opened the season with a favorable schedule against the Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars. They are considered two of the worst teams in the NFL and the bottom two projected teams in their division. They have struggled to a 0-1-1 record with Matt Ryan throwing just one touchdown and four interceptions. Ryan threw three interceptions and zero touchdowns in an embarrassing Week 2 loss against the Jaguars. It may be time for the Colts to consider making a change before the 2022 NFL season gets away from them. Their current options include Sam Ehlinger, an unproven youngster, and Nick Foles, a former Super Bowl winning quarterback. #2 - Mitch Trubisky, Pittsburgh Steelers Pittsburgh Steelers QB Mitch Trubisky     Ben Roethlisberger retired during the 2022 NFL offseason, sparking a new era for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The organization decided to sign Mitch Trubisky during free agency to replace their legendary quarterback. He has been unimpressive so far, completing less than 60 percent of his passes while the Steelers offense has looked relatively lost.     Trubisky will be pressured to immediately raise his performance level as rookie Kenny Pickett waits on the bench for his eventual turn to take over as the starting quarterback. The Steelers used a 2022 first-round draft pick on Pickett, and with Trubisky's slow start it may spark a quick change.     #3 - Baker Mayfield, Carolina Panthers Carolina Panthers QB Baker Mayfield The Carolina Panthers have been unable to find a reliable starting quarterback since Matt Rhule took over as their head coach prior to the start of the 2020 NFL season. They have gone through several failed options, leading them to acquire Baker Mayfield during the 2022 offseason.     Mayfield continues the trend of poor quarterback play for the Panthers as he's statistically been one of the worst quarterbacks in the league through two games of the 2022 season. He currently ranks last among all starting quarterbacks in completion percentage as well as QBR, while the Panthers have a 0-2 record. Almost any other possible option would be better than Mayfield so far this year.     "", 'Skip Bayless rails LeBron James for a sluggish performance against Pelicans: “You could have that Jordan flu game against the wounded Pelicans”  LeBron James and the LA Lakers are starting to find their groove. They are on a two-game win streak after opening the season with five straight losses.  The Lakers beat the New Orleans Pelicans 120-117 in overtime. One of the stories of the game was LeBron James\' health. James was reportedly feeling the effects of an illness that had him bedridden for three days.        James overcame the illness to finish with 20 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists in 40 minutes of action. But don\'t let the statline fool you. James struggled with his shot all game long. He shot just 9-for-23 from the field and 0-for-7 from 3-point range.      On a recent episode of ""Skip and Shannon: Undisputed,"" co-host Skip Bayless analyzed LeBron James\' performance against the Pelicans. He wasn\'t impressed with the 18-time All-Star.

But there\'s still plenty of work to be done. The team is still three games under .500. Their upcoming schedule will present some challenges. The Lakers will take on the red-hot Utah Jazz on Friday, following which they will face the Cleveland Cavaliers, who have one of the best records in the NBA. The Lakers will take it one game at a time. The way they\'ve performed lately is promising.     The most encouraging sign for the Lakers is their ability to win games when LeBron James is struggling. James has shot 42.2% from the field and 16.7% from 3-point range in the last two games. Dave McMenamin@mctenLeBron James said there was “something going around” that hit him pretty bad and he was bed-ridden from the Nuggets game until today with the illness.

He said he plans to go straight to bed tonight for more rest. It even caused him to miss the team Halloween party. The Lakers continue to get production off the bench from All-Star guard Russell Westbrook. Westbrook has averaged 15.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 8.5 assists in the Lakers\' two wins. He also shot 54.5% from the field. It looked like their season was spiraling out of control. But the Lakers have found life. They will have to play more consistently to keep up with the tough competition in the Western Conference.The hope is that James can return to form after an extra day of rest. Despite his recent stretch of performances, James has been sensational this season. He\'s averaged 25.0 points, 9.0 rebounds and 7.4 assists through seven games.

Tracing the former G League player's path to NBA and LA Lakers  When the Los Angeles Lakers played the defending champions Golden State Warriors in their pre-season clash yesterday, Matt Ryan stole the limelight. Everyone expected LeBron James, Stephen Curry or youngster Jordan Poole to be in focus, but Matt Ryan became the talk of the game instead.  As the opening night draws closer, NBA teams are starting to round out their roster. Throughout the summer, the media has focused on the Los Angeles Lakers' attempt to re-construct their roster after a disappointing season. The Lakers General Manager and President of Basketball Operations, Rob Pelinka, has surrounded LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook with small athletic guards and bigs.        However, outside shooting is a glaring problem with the Lakers' roster. With the need for outside shooting at an all-time high, the Lakers might look towards G League sharpshooter Matt Ryan.       Ryan had a great shooting night against the Warriors, and his performance even led to appreciation from LeBron James. Ryan launched all of his shots from beyond the three-point arc, connecting on 6-9 shooting from deep. That said, he didn't impact the game in any other way. Matt Ryan's journey so far Matt Ryan entered the NBA draft in 2020, but the 6-foot-7 wing went undrafted. He played for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Summer League.  Ryan then had a couple of stints with the Denver Nuggets and Boston Celtics, but barely made the teams. He spent most of this time playing for their G-League affiliates, the Grand Rapids Gold and Maine Celtics. Matt Ryan is known for his shooting prowess. And with the Lakers desperate to add shooting to their roster, he might have a chance of making an NBA roster. However, like most undrafted players, Ryan has many weak spots in his game.     One advantage in Ryan's favor is the lack of big wings on the Lakers' roster. The Lakers will constantly need bodies to guard Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo. If the former Notre Dame player can shore up his defense, he will have a real chance to get some quality minutes on the Lakers roster. With LeBron James entering his 20th season and Anthony Davis not durable enough to grind it out every game, Matt Ryan could make a case to be a rotation wing in coach Ham's new system.Current Lakers' player development coach Phil Handy is among the best in the business at what he does. Matt Ryan may well end up being his next great developmental gem.

The question that most fans, analysts, and insiders alike have when a good player retires is whether that player is a future Hall of Famer or not.  With Matt Ryan, it is a very curious case. The former MVP put up prolific numbers, especially during his 14 seasons in Atlanta. However, he doesn't have a Super Bowl ring to show for it. Are his great numbers good enough to get him into Canton? Let's take a closer look.        Ryan's Historic Arm           To say Matt Ryan made a career with his right arm is a bit of an understatement. According to Pro Football Reference, the 4-time Pro-Bowler ranks 7th all-time in career passing yards (62,792). He sits at No. 5 all-time in passes completed with 5,551. Additionally, he is 9th all-time in passing touchdowns with a career mark of 381. The former Boston College star threw for over 4,000 passing yards in 10 of his 14 career seasons in Atlanta. He has an NFL record for the most consecutive 200-yard performances in NFL history (64). He is one of the most accomplished throwers in football in the long history of the National Football League.        Matt Ryan's All-Time Awards Ryan's career portfolio, aside from the numbers, is incredibly impressive. Again, he is a 4-time Pro-Bowler and former league MVP (2016-17). On separate occasions, he has also led the NFL in passer rating (2016) and completion percentage (2012). Ryan is also a former Rookie of the Year (2008) and former Offensive Player of the Year (2016). Despite a forgetful 2022 season with the Colts, Matt Ryan has had a historic career. He is the Falcons' all-time leading passer in attempts, completions, yards, touchdowns, passer rating, and 300-yard games. If you are arguably the best player in the history of the franchise, Canton should be within your grasp. That is exactly the case for Matt Ryan. No Super Bowl Doesn't Mean No Hall of Fame Despite not having a Super Bowl ring on his shelf, Ryan still has a good shot at the Hall of Fame. Aside from his Hall of Fame numbers, the Pro Football Hall of Fame has a history of welcoming in quarterbacks who lack a Super Bowl ring.     The likes of Fran Tarkenton, Dan Marino, Jim Kelly, and Warren Moon are all notable quarterbacks who have bronze busts in Canton, OH. Matt Ryan has more passing yards and a better passer rating than all three of them.Ryan has great all-time numbers on his side. There is no question about that. Additionally, he has history on his side when it comes to similar quarterbacks making the Hall of Fame without a Super Bowl ring. Is Ryan deserving of the Hall of Fame? Yes, he undoubtedly is.     "", 'Lonnie Walker IV revels in breakout performance in LA Lakers win with 28 points: ""My jump shot\'s too beautiful not to\xa0be\xa0hitting\xa03s""  Lonnie Walker IV was a big reason for the LA Lakers\' win against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday, November 2. After five consecutive losses, the Lakers are finally back in the win column with back-to-back wins.  LeBron James struggled to hit a shot from beyond the arc against New Orleans and went 0-7. He still scored 20 points while having difficulty scoring the ball and grabbed 10 rebounds while dishing out eight assists. Luckily for Los Angeles, Lonnie Walker IV came up big for them, scoring 28 points.        Walker IV had five threes during the game while only attempting nine shots. With his impressive shooting, the Lakers were able to hold their own against a tough Pelicans team. After the game, the 6-foot-4 guard shared that he\'s starting to get comfortable attempting long-distance shots.       ""Absolutely. After games, I\'ve been staying in the gym getting as much shots as I can. My jump shot\'s too beautiful not to be hitting 3s. I\'ma continue to shoot with confidence,"" Walker IV said when asked about this performance from beyond the arc.        When the athletic guard was asked how the Lakers were able to maintain their composure after a disappointing start to the season, he said: ""We\'re starting to get more and more comfortable as a team. Defensively, we\'re doing phenomenal and the offense is finally starting to transition."" The Lakers\' match against the Pelicans was one of the most thrilling games of the season. Despite their struggles from three, it was Matt Ryan\'s game-tying 3-pointer that sent the game into overtime. From there, the team focused on beating the Pelicans and ultimately won with a score of 120-117.        This was also the third game where Russell Westbrook played the game as the Lakers\' sixth man. This strategy looks like it could give Los Angeles more wins moving forward.  Lonnie Walker IV could be the Lakers\' third option Portland Trail Blazers v Los Angeles Lakers Regardless of the struggles of the Lakers, they seem to have honed a new scoring threat in Lonnie Walker IV. The former shooting guard for the San Antonio Spurs has been one of the few bright spots for Los Angeles. Through seven games, he\'s averaging over 16.1 points, 2.3 assists and 1.1 steals.        On paper, he\'s not really the best facilitator for the Lakers, and that\'s okay. The team has James and Westbrook in that area. Lonnie Walker IV has brought a different kind of energy to the team, he\'s been staying aggressive on offense and alert on defense. He\'s also been playing a lot, averaging 32.7 minutes this season. Talent-wise, Westbrook is the true third option for the team, but he hasn\'t been a good fit for the starting five. Which is why moving him to the bench was the right move for Darvin Ham. Now, the Lakers have a more spaced-out offense to stop opposing teams from crowding the paint.Los Angeles is hoping to continue their two-game win streak. However, their next matchup could be a tough one, as they\'ll take on the Utah Jazz, who have been on fire since the 77th NBA season started.

LeBron James and the LA Lakers kept their win streak going Wednesday night thanks to the play of an unlikely hero. Down three in the final seconds, a play was run for Matt Ryan, who nailed a corner 3 as time expired to send the game into overtime.  From there, the Lakers went on to win by a final score of 120-117. Along with his big shot down the stretch, Ryan posted 11 points and converted on three of his nine attempts from beyond the arc.        The morning after this OT thriller, Skip Bayless went on FS1\'s ""Skip and Shannon: Undisputed"" to give his thoughts on the matchup. He proceeded to take a shot at LeBron James, saying he was bailed out by a role player following a poor performance:      ""I never thought I would see the night that somebody named Matt Ryan, and not that Matt Ryan, but the NBA\'s Matt Ryan, that that Matt Ryan would take LeBron off the hook for choking his guts out."" Bayless added: ""He was choking his guts out. Once again, right on cue. I keep telling you, LeBron does not have the closer gene."" In the 10 minutes he played in the fourth quarter of Wednesday\'s game against the Pelicans, James scored only four points and shot only 1 of 5 from the floor.

Heading into this season, all the talk around the Lakers was that they put a cast of players around LeBron James who don\'t complement him. The All-Star forward is known for his high IQ and ability to find open shooters. Meanwhile, LA opened the year on track to become the worst 3-point shooting team in league history. Star players aren\'t going to have it every night. Which is why Skip Bayless shouldn\'t be judging LeBron\'s ability to close a game on a Wednesday night just three weeks into the season. Looking through history, there are plenty of examples of role players coming up big for stars. Most notably, when Michael Jordan found Steve Kerr for an open 3-pointer in the playoffs during their time with the Chicago Bulls. LeBron was having an off night, and his teammates managed to help bail out the team and steal the win. What stands out from this game is that the Lakers are finally getting help in a key area of need.For LeBron James to be at his best, he needs proper shooting around him. If Matt Ryan can continue to be a reliable shooter from deep, it will help the future Hall of Famer maximize his game.     ']"
39,Brock Osweiler,"['NFL history: The 5 worst offseason moves of all-time  NFL owners aren’t shy about taking out their wallets and plunking down enormous sums of cash in front of free agents. Yet, maybe they should.  In some instances, even the biggest and most notable star players have struggled in new locations on their NFL new teams. As we peek around today’s landscape, it’s difficult to pinpoint who will become the next player to struggle after being given an enormous contract.        Will Von Miller live up to the hype in Buffalo after being handed a six-year deal worth $120 million? How about Davante Adams? Now that he has his money, will he live up to the five-year, $141 million contract given to him by the Las Vegas Raiders?           All of those questions will be answered this season. But before we find out which moves were sagacious, let’s look back at some of the most horrendous offseason moves in NFL history. #1. Daunte Culpepper Minnesota Vikings v Detroit Lions     At one point, Daunte Culpepper was a terrific NFL quarterback. In 2003 and 2004, in particular, the light switch went off. The former Minnesota Viking made back-to-back Pro Bowls and led the Vikings to respectability. In 2004, he led the entire NFL in passing yards, throwing for 4,717 to go along with 39 touchdowns. Unfortunately for Culpepper, his career took a turn for the worse during the 2005 season. Halfway through the year, Culpepper crumbled to the turf with a torn ACL, MCL, and PCL in his knee. For whatever reason, the Miami Dolphins believed they could get Culpepper’s career back on track. In exchange, the franchise handed over a 2006 second-round pick to the Vikings but quickly moved off him. In only four games, Culpepper was a shell of his former self, leading the Dolphins to only one victory during his time as a starter while throwing two touchdowns and three interceptions. #2. Nick Foles Chicago Bears v Jacksonville Jaguars     Nick Foles effectively turned two of the best years of his career into life-changing money with the Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2017, the hopes and dreams of the Philadelphia Eagles were pinned firmly on the shoulders of Foles. Made For Philly@MadeForPhillyThe best individual performance in Philadelphia sports history.Nick Foles. SBLII.2951610The best individual performance in Philadelphia sports history.Nick Foles. SBLII. https://t.co/qoQ57wfKph With Carson Wentz forced to miss the entire NFL postseason due to a torn ACL, Foles was asked to step up. To the surprise of many, he would do so in a big way.         Foles and his Eagles took care of business throughout the playoffs, resulting in an unlikely Super Bowl ring. The following year, Wentz went down with another injury before the playoffs, with Foles again leading them on another deep run. The Jaguars saw more than enough out of Blake Bortles and opted to go in another direction, handing Foles a four-year deal worth $88 million. In the first game of the NFL 2019 season, Foles suffered a broken Clavicle. While he would eventually return several months later, he did deliver his best. In just one season, the Jaguars decided against keeping Foles as their long-term solution as their starter, going with Gardner Minshew and sending Foles to the Chicago Bears. #3. Matt Flynn Green Bay Packers v Miami Dolphins     Throughout our infamous list and littered across NFL history, players have inked enormous contracts due to a stellar breakout season. Maybe even two. Never, however, has a player been rewarded due to one game. Well, meet Matt Flynn. Eli Berkovits@BookOfEli_NFLThrowback to Matt Flynn\'s LEGENDARY 480 yard, 6 TD performance in 2011...What a game.1703135Throwback to Matt Flynn\'s LEGENDARY 480 yard, 6 TD performance in 2011...What a game.https://t.co/Rpiri8c2gU With a historically significant season already wrapped up, Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers were on their way to the NFL postseason in 2011 after putting together a 14-1 record. In the season\'s final game, Rodgers sat on the sidelines, as did many of the starters. In his place, of course, was backup Matt Flynn.     A relative unknown at this point, Flynn turned several heads with his jaw-dropping performance. Flynn threw for 480 yards, completing 31 of his 44 passes and lofting six—yes, six!—touchdowns into the end zone. The Seattle Seahawks believed the then 27-year-old was their quarterback of the future, inking him to a three-year deal worth $19 million.    Shortly after, Flynn was outplayed in training camp by rookie Russell Wilson. Flynn became expendable and was traded the following year to the Buffalo Bills.     #4. Brock Osweiler Divisional Round - Houston Texans v New England Patriots Quarterbacks don\'t usually come in Brock Osweiler\'s size. The former second-round pick stood at 6\'7"" and weighed 240 pounds. But despite his enormous dimensions, Osweiler was far from impressive. Yet, regardless of his unimpressive play, the Houston Texans gave the middling quarterback a four-year deal worth $72 million. Overall, Osweiler was solid, throwing 2,957 yards and 15 touchdowns, but his 16 interceptions and 59 percent completion rate were awful. The Texans accepted that they had made a huge mistake and got rid of the gargantuan quarterback. Osweiler only proved that the Texans were right to cut ties. At the age of 28, after bouncing around a bit more, Osweiler was ushered out of the league. However, before finding himself without a job, Osweiler attempted to revitalize his career by returning to Denver. Needless to say, it was a disaster.     Osweiler started four games back in his old stomping grounds but exhibited many of the same problems that have always plagued him. He would lose every game as the team\'s starter and completed only 55.8 percent of his passes. He was also not the best in the pocket, throwing five touchdowns and five interceptions. #5. Albert Haynesworth Denver Broncos v Washington Redskins As a Tennessee Titan, Albert Haynesworth was arguably the best defensive tackle in the NFL. In 2007 and 2008, Haynesworth truly stood out. He finished the year with 14.5 combined sacks and 91 combined tackles. His numbers resulted in back-to-back Pro-Bowl appearances and consecutive All-Pro berths.     Haynesworth\'s best seasons were rewarded with a ridiculous deal worth $100 million for seven years with the Washington Redskins. Ultimately, the financial ramifications were a tough pill to swallow. Still, Washington believed Haynesworth was a franchise-altering kind of player and one they needed to get themselves over the championship hump. Once Haynesworth got his money, his motivation went entirely out the window. He reached well over 300 pounds, appeared lethargic, and had uninspiring performances on the pitch. In year one, Haynesworth recorded just four sacks in 12 games. During the following season, they were done with him. He didn\'t start a single game before being shown the door the following year.

Players look to move into free agency for a multitude of reasons: they want a change of scenery for their family, they want to reunite playing with an old collegiate teammate, or quite simply, they want the best chance to win a Super Bowl.        However, there is another reason why players are so eager to stay healthy in the final year of their contract… money.           Leaving your team and becoming a free agent makes you a precious commodity, especially if it is a lean year in your particular position. A dearth of productive running backs will see a medium-to-good player in that role immediately become worth $10 million more than in a class with more options. This can tempt players to make money-based decisions, with some choosing to leave their team in favor of a big payday. Here are 5 NFL players who have regretted leaving for money #1 - Nate Solder Super Bowl LI - New England Patriots v Atlanta Falcons     Nate Solder was a star offensive lineman for the New England Patriots and was one of the rare first-round selections higher than No. 20 of the Bill Belichick era. There was little shock when Solder arrived, as he immediately started 13 of the Patriots’ 16 games in his rookie season, allowing just three sacks and four quarterback pressures. Solder would continue to have this consistency throughout his career in New England, becoming one of the best linemen in the NFL, constantly giving Tom Brady valuable protection. Two Super Bowl championships came during his time in Foxboro. But in 2018, he elected to leave the franchise and explore free agency. He signed a four-year, $62 million deal with $35 million guaranteed with the New York Giants. Having chosen a path that saw him become the highest-paid offensive lineman in the NFL, Solder quickly realized that the Giants had a poor roster. He missed the playoffs for the first time in his career in his debut year in New York and was never quite the same player.     As a result of COVID-19, Solder opted out of the 2020 season before returning in 2021. After another challenging year for the Giants, his contract was automatically voided, putting him on the free-agent market again. #2 - Josh Norman Carolina Panthers v Washington Redskins Josh Norman in Carolina was a machine. He was one of the closest cornerbacks to Darrelle Revis we’ve seen since Revis Island himself left receivers stranded every week. He was so dominant that teams simply refused to target his side of the field, hence why his interception numbers were so low. But teams could see just what an impact he made on Carolina’s defense.     After being drafted relatively late at 25 years old, Norman spent four years with the Panthers, where he was comfortable, even coming fourth in the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award for 2015. This made Norman a valuable commodity, and he looked to maximize his wealth on the open market, signing with the Washington Commanders for five years and $75 million. While he announced a media career with Fox would run in conjunction with his time in Washington, it was clear that Norman had made a poor choice. He was never the same dominant defensive player in the NFL, being benched several times for poor plays. NFL Memes@NFL_MemesDERRICK HENRY JUST THREW JOSH NORMAN OUT OF THE CLUB204283282DERRICK HENRY JUST THREW JOSH NORMAN OUT OF THE CLUB https://t.co/0OmAr9aPDb     He was released after four years and then spent single seasons with the Buffalo Bills and the San Francisco 49ers, where his diminishing speed made him an attractive target for quarterbacks rather than a feared one. #3 - DeMarco Murray Washington Redskins v Dallas Cowboys The lifespan of a running back in the NFL can be short, given that it places huge physical demands on the legs and muscles of a player. DeMarco Murray, though, was a player who had earned every penny of what the Philadelphia Eagles were willing to pay him.     In four seasons with the Dallas Cowboys, Murray had emerged as one of the most dominant backs in the NFL. His final two seasons in Dallas saw him rush for 1,121 yards and an NFL-leading 1,845 yards, respectively. In 2014 he won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year award and carried the Cowboys back to relevance. Murray was a hero in Dallas, breaking Emmitt Smith’s single-season rushing record with the Cowboys, but he elected to leave to earn more money in Philadelphia. His career has never been the same, and it should serve as a cautionary tale to young running backs; they need to know the value of their body. Murray signed a $42 million deal with the Eagles but was there for only one season. He managed just 702 yards before being traded to the Tennessee Titans. A brief return to productivity occurred with a 2016 pro-bowl season where Murray rushed for 1,287 yards, but after a dismal second season in Nashville, he retired from the NFL.     It was a dramatic fall from grace when, in fact, he was probably closer to a Super Bowl in the comfort of his situation in Dallas. #4 - Le’Veon Bell Buffalo Bills v New York Jets Le’Veon Bell’s relationship with the Pittsburgh Steelers was troublesome for several years. Mike Tomlin did his best to manage the trifecta of Ben Roethlisberger, Bell, and Brown, but ultimately something had to give. Despite their difficulties in Pittsburgh, all three played their very best football together with the Steelers, so it’s a shame to see how things panned out.     Bell rushed for over 1,250 yards in three of his five active seasons with the Steelers. He was one of the best rushers in the NFL but elected to sit out the 2018 season after refusing to sign the franchise tag for a second successive season. After a year away from the NFL, Bell would eventually be released and given the freedom to sign an eye-watering $52.5 million contract with the New York Jets for four years. He lasted one full year in the Big Apple before being released two games into his second season. The motivation was gone, the spark was gone, and he was then unsuccessfully bounced between Kansas City, Baltimore, and Tampa Bay. He made his money, but he never recovered from a year out of the NFL, and he would have enjoyed so much more success in Pittsburgh. #5 - Brock Osweiler San Diego Chargers v Denver Broncos     There is no way to look at Brock Osweiler’s NFL career without feeling pain. After valiantly serving as backup to Peyton Manning in Denver, Osweiler inadvertently won a Super Bowl in such a role. However, his performances during Manning’s injury layoffs did enough to convince teams of his ability in a year where there wasn’t a great deal of quality available at quarterback. Osweiler refused to stay with the Broncos after his contract expired at the end of the 2015 season, instead electing to hit free agency and see what serious money he could make. The Houston Texans duly obliged, offering Osweiler a $72 million deal over four years, with a staggering $37 million guaranteed. Such a deal put pressure on Osweiler that his talent couldn’t shoulder. His only season in Houston ended with 2,957 passing yards and more interceptions than touchdowns. It was an unmitigated disaster, and while it perhaps highlighted the fact you can’t judge a quarterback by such a small sample size of NFL play, there is also a sense that Osweiler simply wasn’t that talented.     Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterStunner: Texans trade Brock Osweiler AND 2018 2nd-rd pick to CLEV for Browns to take Osweiler contract off Houston books, sources tell ESPN.940110132Stunner: Texans trade Brock Osweiler AND 2018 2nd-rd pick to CLEV for Browns to take Osweiler contract off Houston books, sources tell ESPN. The problem for the player himself, though, especially if he looks back in hindsight, is that had he been patient and stayed with the Broncos, Manning was about to retire. He knew the entire system and playbook in Denver and could have easily settled as a starter in a much better situation than what he found in Houston. Osweiler is a far richer man because of this move, but he perhaps missed out on a far better NFL career.

There was the era of Peyton Manning from 2012 to 2015 where Von Miller played two Super Bowls and won one. Since Manning retired, it has been a rough going for the Broncos. With Teddy Bridgewater, it seems like things were still going to be the same.     Against the New York Giants in Week 1, Teddy Bridgewater went 28/36 (77.78%) for 264 yards and two TDs. I would say that was better than most people expected him to play, and he showed great accuracy on his intermediate throws.

Miller praised Teddy Bridgewater for his pep talks, and said they go a long way. His pep talks obviously worked well enough to get the win in Week 1.  It\'s also a huge positive for Teddy, as his leadership skills shine along with his abilities on the field. Vic Fangio may have made the right call after all by going with Teddy over Drew Lock.

Teddy Bridgewater will need to avoid turnovers that cost the team the victory and stay accurate with his throws, though. Hell, those Aaron Rodgers rumors of him joining the Denver Broncos could be over by the trade deadline at this rate. That was especially after how bad Aaron Rodgers was in Week 1 and how good Teddy Bridgewater fared during the same week.     ', ""Best Quarterback Rooms in NFL - 2018 Edition  The quarterback position is arguably the most important position in the NFL, while the backup quarterback position is the second most important position. The spot has not been in a better situation than 2018 in a long time. The quarterback climate has a perfect mix of veterans and new blood.  The ranking for the quarterback room has taken into account the starter, backup quarterback, scout team QB, supporting cast, offensive system and teams' expected run-to-pass ratio along with past performance and history of injury.        The article ranks the teams by scoring each quarterback and taking the cumulative score as a marker. The third quarterback is only taken into account if they are a viable trade bait or hold any chance to start during the regular season.           #32 Jacksonville Jaguars Starter - Blake Bortles, Backup - Cody Kessler Blake Bortles will try to not let his defense down It is one of the very few quarterback-proof rosters in the NFL. The team will look to lean on the run game in the offense this season. Blake Bortles has to improve his mechanics to move out the bottom of the list and Kessler will need to shake off his winless season with the Browns.     #31 Carolina Panthers Starter - Cam Newton, Backup - Taylor Heinicke Newton will have to become the Superman from 2015 Cam has to be the Superman again under new ownership. Panthers have Taylor Heinicke as their backup. If you are thinking who that person is, you are not alone. #30 Kansas City Chiefs Starter - Pat Mahomes, Backup - Chad Henne Mahomes will have to be the present and future of the squad     Pat Mahomes has not started a relevant game in the NFL. He has potential but Texas Tech's air raid offense is not the best to go by. Chad Henne couldn't beat out Blake Bortles at his worst, which is not the best news for Chiefs faithful. #29 Miami Dolphins Starter - Ryan Tannehill, Backup - Brock Osweiler Tannehill will be playing for his job Brock Osweiler can't be described as the best backup policy for Tannehill, who is coming back from a knee injury last season. The coaching staff is in the hot seat and sharing the division with Patriots does not help.     #28 Washington Redskins Starter - Alex Smith, Backup - Colt McCoy Alex Smith will have to bring his MVP season from Kansas City Alex Smith might live up to his MVPesque season from last time but McCoy would live on as a below average backup QB forever. Alex Smith ain't the worst option after Kirk Cousins left. #27 Houston Texans Starter - Deshaun Watson. Backup - Brandon Weeden Deshaun Watson will have to be the player he was before the injury     Houston has Weeden as their backup to their sophomore superstar coming off an ACL injury, O'Brien would hope for a better option than that. The team hopes to stay fit next season and do some damage in AFC. #26 Dallas Cowboys Starter - Dak Prescott, Backup - Mike White, Cooper Rush Prescott will get his sidekick in Ezekial Elliott back for the season Dak and Zeke form a formidable offense but the Cowboys quarterback room could do better than Mike White and Rush. Jason Garrett must be hoping for Kellen Moore (probably not).     #25 Cincinnati Bengals Starter - Andy Dalton, Backup - Matt Barkley Dalton will have to bemoreconsistent upcoming season Cincinnati Bengals have changes looming in front of them, the coaching staff is in the hot seat and the QB room ain't helping. Andy Dalton has been used to define the term 'average' all over the NFL dictionary and Barkley never lived up to his high school potential. #24 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Starter - Winston, Backup - Ryan Fitzpatrick Tampa Bay will not have Winston for the first 3 weeks per suspension     Winston will serve his ban and Ryan Fitzpatrick will be QB-1 in the depth chart, sounds depressing, probably is. #23 Baltimore Ravens Starter/ Backup - Joe Flacco, Lamar Jackson. The QB competition is in full swing at Ravens camp Ravens' coaching has been immensely impressed with rookie Lamar Jackson. The reports from preseason indicate that Joe Flacco has been showing more initiation as well. Ravens will be looking to capitalize on a soft AFC. #22 Chicago Bears Starter - Mitchell Trubisky, Backup - Chase Daniels Trubisky can lead Bears to playoffs and become the greatest franchise QB     Bears have a new offensive system and Chase Daniel as the backup, who has come from the Chiefs system that Matt Nagy will be running. Trubisky needs to live up to his draft pedigree and Bears can easily jump to the next tier. #21 Buffalo Bills Starter - AJ McCarron, Backup - Josh Allen, Nathan Peterman The team will hope for Josh Allen to win the starting job Bills brought in McCarron from Bengals as an insurance policy to their Rookie, Josh Allen. Bills have an average starter, one raw rookie, and a backup with starting capabilities in Peterman. No one should be surprised if everyone gets a start in Buffalo.     #20 Denver Broncos Starter - Case Keenum, Backup - Paxton Lynch, Chad Kelly Keenum will hop to fill the big shoes of Peyton Manning Case Keenum had a career year last season but he won't have the similar support cast as Minnesota. Paxton Lynch has bust written all over him and won't even command a conditional pick in return. #19 Tennessee Titans Starter - Marcus Mariota, Backup - Blaine Gabbert Mariota needs to bounce back from a dreadful last season     Titans have been a run first team but Mariota needs to improve his play for them to compete against Houston in the division. Gabbert can be a great backup in the correct system with his cannon arm and great mobility. #18 New York Giants Starter - Eli Manning, Backup - Davis Webb/ Kyle Lauletta Eli Manning will have to deliver with the run game to support Eli Manning has lost way too many steps to be a top tier QB but his stellar offensive sidekicks should take him to the belief land. Davis Webb has been making a lot of noise this offseason along with Kyle Lauletta at the backup position.     #17 Oakland Raiders Starter - Derek Carr, Backup - Connor Cooks Derek Carr will have to gel into Gruden's offense sooner than later Derek Carr underachieved last season. Cook and Carr will soon realize that life under Gruden is not as rosy as Gruden Camp. The team has Jeff Fisher vibes of finishing 8-8. #16 Detroit Lions Starter - Matthew Stafford, Backup - Matt Cassel Stafford can rise up to the next level     Stafford has one of the best arm seen in the sport but he needs a better support cast. How does Matt Cassel still have a job in NFL, even though it is as a backup? #15 Atlanta Falcons Starter - Matt Ryan, Backup - Matt Schaub Matt Ryan can bring the Falcons to the top Matt Ryan has had a legendary career till now, without winning the big one. The bad news is that they have Matt Schaub as the backup. #14 New Orleans Saints Starter - Drew Brees, Backup - Tom Savage     Drew Brees will look to take Saints further than last time Saints are moving on to a more run-heavy offense which might help the longevity of Brees. Saints are one of the big boys of NFC and Brees would love to make one last run before father time gets him. Tom Savage is not what you dream of as a backup but Saints don't have an option. Hill is the scout team QB who is turning heads at camp. #13 Seattle Seahawks Starter - Russell Wilson, Backup - Austin Davis     Russell Wilson will look for some help from the run offense Russell Wilson is a one-man offense for Seahawks with zero run game, no O-line help and below par receiving core. Russell Wilson does it all but sadly Austin Davis can't. The diminishing quality of Seahawks defense makes their chances of playoff dim. #12 Los Angeles Rams LA Rams - Starter - Jared Goff, Backup - Sean Mannion Goff will look to improve on his stellar performance last season     Jared Goff took a big leap last season. Sean McVay has been a godsend to Rams offense. Sean Mannion is not the best backup option but he has been in the system and a good subordinate to the young future of Los Angeles. Goff is a sneaky MVP candidate with Gurley by the sides. #11 Pittsburgh Steelers Starter - Roethlisberger, Backup - Mason Rudolph/ Landry Jones Roethlisberger will look to capitalize on Bell's last year in Pittsburgh Steelers have a complete offense led by Big Ben. His two quarterback understudies are raw and with minimal arm talent. Roethlisberger has been injured in bits and pieces over the last few seasons and the weak backup situation doesn't help the Steelers.     #10 Los Angeles Chargers Starter - Rivers, Backup - Geno Smith/ Cardale Jones Rivers will be looking for some luck and support from the fans Rivers is a great starter with a competent backup in Geno Smith. The run game led by Melvin Gordon with the receiving talent of Keenan Allen would be a handful for any defense. If the team stays fit, they can be a challenger for the AFC title. #09 San Francisco 49ers Starter - Jimmy Garoppolo, Backup - CJ Bethard Jimmy G will look to become Jimmy GQ     Garoppolo ended the 49ers season last year with 5 wins. The only way for the 49ers is up. Kyle Shanahan has one of the most sophisticated offenses in the league. CJ Bethard as the backup is a little suspect. Bay area is waiting for Jimmy G to become Jimmy Jesus. #8 Cleveland Browns Starter - Tyrod Taylor, Backup - Baker Mayfield/ Drew Stanton Baker and Tyrod will look to bring back the glory at Cleveland Browns were the worst team in Football but they have added to every position on the pitch. Taylor is a dependable QB, who can give you 5 wins on his worst day. Baker is the future with great football ethics and Drew Stanton will be a great third QB while developing a rookie. Browns look like a sneaky break out team for the upcoming season.     #07 Green Bay Packers Starter - Aaron Rodgers, Backup - DeShone Kizer Rodgers will be without his favorite wide receiver next season Rodgers has been known to hide most of the blemishes of his team. Packers traded for Kizer to be the backup, who was the QB of a 16 loss team. The addition of Jimmy Graham at tight end position will come as a great help after Nelson left. #06 New England Patriots Starter - Tom Brady, Backup - Brian Hoyer/ Danny Etling Brady will look to defy father time for one more season     Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time. Brian Hoyer is definitely not the greatest backup quarterback of all time. Brady's age is a sign of trouble but he is the reigning MVP of the league. Patriots have drafted Danny Etling in the late rounds who could turn up to be a great option for the future. #05 Indianapolis Colts Starter - Andrew Luck, Backup - Jacoby Brissett Luck finally looks set to be back alongside promising backup in Brissett If Andrew Luck wasn't coming back from injury, Colts could have been the top team in this exercise. Brissett has been a great trade by Colts. Luck has started training again and the revamped offensive line won't hurt either. The future looks bright for the franchise.     #04 New York Jets Starter/ Backup - Darnold, Josh McCown, Bridgewater Jets will have one of the most balanced quarterback room No one expected Jets to end up this high on the list but they have a great experienced starter and teacher in Josh McCown. They arguably got the best quarterback from the recent draft in Sam Darnold and they signed Teddy Bridgewater for free in the offseason. Bridgewater is the biggest trade asset in the league and front-runner for the comeback player of the year. Jets have stability at the position for the first time in a long time.     #03 Minnesota Vikings Starter - Kirk Cousins, Backup - Trevor Siemian Cousins will be expected to live up to his price tag The future looks bright for the franchise. Kirk Cousins is underrated even after being the costliest player in football and Siemian is as good a backup as any. Vikings will try to make the run in a loaded NFC. #02 Arizona Cardinals Starter - Sam Bradford, Backup - Josh Rosen/ Mike Glennon Rosen will look to earn the starts while Bradford needs to stay fit     The Cardinals have one of the most polished QB coming out of College in Rosen. Sam Bradford can be a top 15 quarterback when fit. The quarterback room compliments each other, unlike any other team. Cardinals can shock a lot of people next season. #01 Philadelphia Eagles Starter - Carson Wentz, Backup - Nick Foles Eagles would love another Philly special, with Wentz this time Nick Foles just won Philly the Superbowl, while the future MVP of the league (Wentz) was sidelined with an injury. Eagles have things sorted till Foles gets traded for too many draft picks. The Eagles QB room might just help them reach the mountaintop again. The in-depth look into every quarterback room made me realize that Matt Cassel, Matt Schaub, and Landry Jones will keep having backup jobs in 2096 and no one will ever notice. In conclusion. my biggest fear is that Blake Bortles will end up winning the Superbowl and make this article as irrelevant as his throwing motion.

It is a notoriously difficult place to fill at the best of times, but it is especially difficult when someone is trying to replace an all-time great like Peyton Manning.  We take a look at every starter who has played for the Denver Broncos in that position since Peyton Manning's retirement. As this has been such an unstable position for the franchise after Peyton Manning, in most seasons, they have had multiple starters in the given position. So, for the purposes of clarity, only those who started most games are listed at the top and others who played in those seasons are mentioned separately.                       Denver Broncos quarterbacks since Peyton Manning retired 2016 and 2017 - Trevor Siemian Right after Peyton Manning retired, Brock Osweiler, who had started some of the games the previous year with Peyton Manning in their Super Bowl-winning season, left for the Houston Texans to become their starter. That opened up the field for third-choice Trevor Siemian to compete with rookie Paxton Lynch and veteran Mark Sanchez, and Siemian eventually became the starter.     James Palmer@JamesPalmerTVTrevor Siemian is the only QB with a winning record for the #Broncos since Peyton Manning retired entering the 2016 seasonTrevor Siemian (13-11), Case Keenum (6-10), Paxton Lynch (1-3), Joe Flacco (0-4) and Brock Osweiler (0-4)35588Trevor Siemian is the only QB with a winning record for the #Broncos since Peyton Manning retired entering the 2016 seasonTrevor Siemian (13-11), Case Keenum (6-10), Paxton Lynch (1-3), Joe Flacco (0-4) and Brock Osweiler (0-4) In 2016, he played 14 of 16 games for the Denver Broncos (the last two weeks were quarterbacked by Paxton Lynch) and established himself as the first choice. Even though the Broncos missed the playoffs, he finished with a passer rating of 84.6 that was higher than Peyton Manning and Brock Osweiler from the previous season. Over the last six weeks of his season from Weeks 8 to 14, he averaged more than 300 yards, behind only Tom Brady and Kirk Cousins. He was named a Pro Bowl alternate but did not accept the invitation due to the shoulder surgery he went ahead with after Week 14.        In 2017, now firmly established as a starter but under new coach Vance Joseph, he began the season strongly, and the high point was a game against the Dallas Cowboys where he threw four touchdowns. In Week 6, he suffered a shoulder injury. Then, over the next few weeks, his production declined. He was benched in favor of the returning Brock Osweiler in Week 9, who was himself then relieved by Paxton Lynch in Week 12. After Lynch was injured in that game, Siemian got another chance to lead the Broncos. But another shoulder injury in Week 15 spelled the end of his career with the Broncos as Brock Osweiler relieved him in that game and started in Week 16.     2018 - Case Keenum After the upheaval of the previous season, when the Broncos had three quarterbacks trading places, head coach Vance Joseph chose to reunite with former Houston Texans quarterback Case Keenum, who they traded from the Minnesota Vikings. They stuck with him throughout the season and he started all 16 games as the Broncos went 6-10.    He threw for 3,890 yards with a 62.3 completion rate. He had 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, with a 81.2 passer rating. He was traded to the Washington Redskins for a seventh-round pick in 2019.     2019 - Joe Flacco In 2019, the Denver Broncos decided to go with Joe Flacco, who had won one Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens. There were eerie parallels with Peyton Manning as they plumped for a veteran quarterback and former Super Bowl MVP. He was named the starter and had the job until he faced a neck injury in Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts. In those eight games that he started, he had 1,822 passing yards, six touchdowns, five interceptions, and an 85.1 passer rating. He was subsequently released by the Broncos and went on to sign with the New York Jets, where he still is currently.        After Joe Flacco was injured, he was replaced by Brandon Allen for three games before Drew Lock stepped in for the final five games of the season. The rookie quarterback finished with 1,020 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions in those five games and equalled John Elway's franchise record for most wins by a rookie in Broncos history. His four wins came in just five games compared to the 10 taken by Elway. Peter Baugh@Peter_BaughDrew Lock's rookie year stats for the #Broncos: •5 games played •1,020 yards (204 a game)•7 TD•3 interceptions •4-1 record776Drew Lock's rookie year stats for the #Broncos: •5 games played •1,020 yards (204 a game)•7 TD•3 interceptions •4-1 record 2020 - Drew Lock For his performances the previous season, Lock was named the starter for 2020. In Week 2, he injured his shoulder and would not return until Week 6. During that period, Jeff Driskel and Brett Rypien started one game each. In Week 12, due to a COVID outbreak among the quarterback corps, running back Phillip Lindsay started under center.     Lock's performances in his second season were not up to standard. Case in point, he had 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. This was the joint highest in the league , tied with Carson Wentz, despite Lock only playing 13 matches. His 57.3 completion rate was the lowest among all quarterbacks with, at least, 150 passing attempts that season.    2021 - Teddy Bridgewater In 2021, Teddy Bridgewater, the 2015 Pro Bowler, joined the team from the Carolina Panthers. He beat out Drew Lock to become the starter, though Lock started three games in each of which Bridgewater was out injured. In the 13 games that he started, he threw for 3,052 yards, 18 touchdowns, and seven interceptions for a passer rating of 94.9 with a 66.9 completion percentage. At the end of the season, he was traded to the Miami Dolphins as the Denver Broncos acquired Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks.     2022 - Russell Wilson   Russell Wilson joined from the Seattle Seahawks. In a deal that sent Drew Lock to Seattle, along with other players and draft picks, the future hall-of-famer joined the Denver Broncos for a five-year, $245 million deal. The Broncos will hope to replicate the success they had with Peyton Manning when they last had a future hall-of-famer as their quarterback.     "", 'Top 3 NFL defenses in the last ten years\xa0  The offensive boom in the NFL over the past 10 years led to some teams building defenses that rank among the greatest in league history.   There have been a lot of great defensive units over the last decade but the three we have listed below stand out amongst the lot.         Here are the top three defenses of the last ten years.           Best NFL defenses of the last decade #1 - 2015 Denver Broncos The 2015 Denver Broncos\' defense carried the team during Peyton Manning\'s final year in the league. During the season, the quarterback suffered an injury to his foot and missed a large part of the season.  The defense was so dominant that despite Brock Osweiler filling in for Manning, they still racked up victories. The defense featured Von Miller, DeMarcus Ware, Malik Jackson, Danny Trevathan, Aqib Talib, Chris Harris Jr. and T.J. Ward, among others. The 2015 Denver Broncos\' defense carried the team to victory in Super Bowl 50 as the underdogs.  ""I came to the Denver #Broncos with the type of edge that I feel like the team needed, and it got us to the point of winning Super Bowl 50.""@DeMarcusWare reflects on our historic 2014 free-agent class » https://t.co/XuNA5jKFAo pic.twitter.com/s6uEwkWZ3a— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) March 17, 2020     Going into the game, Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers were riding high after a near-perfect season. However, the Denver Broncos\' defense was able to force two critical turnovers to seal the victory.  The Denver Broncos offense ranked 16th that season and remains the lowest-ranked offense to win a Super Bowl. #2 - 2013 Seattle Seahawks Like the Denver Broncos, the Seattle Seahawks had a sub-par offensive unit. While the offense was good enough to put together scoring drives late in games, they struggled to move the ball consistently for the first three quarters. To negate their offensive woes, the team formed a defense that is now immortalized as the ""Legion of Boom"". It featured Bobby Wagner, K.J. Wright, Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor and Earl Thomas, among others. They quickly became one of the scariest defenses to face, especially in Seattle. Their best performance came when they faced the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 48. The Peyton Manning-led Broncos offense was the highest-scoring in NFL history. The quarterback also set the record for most touchdown passes in a single season with 55.         The Seattle Seahawks came into the game as underdogs but dominated the Denver Broncos. The Seahawks won the game 43-8. #3 - 2020 Los Angeles Rams The 2020 Los Angeles Rams\' defense put up similar numbers to those of the 2013 Seattle Seahawks and the 2015 Denver Broncos.  While the 2020 Los Angeles Rams did not win a championship or stop one of the best offenses of all time, they were as dominant as any other defense in the league at any time.     Jalen RamseyThe 2020 Los Angeles Rams featured Aaron Donald, Jalen Ramsey, Darious Williams, Leonard Floyd and Michael Brockers. Defensive coordinator Brandon Staley\'s incredible work with the Rams\' defense landed him the head coach position of the Los Angeles Chargers.     ', 'Who are the top 10 teams in the NFL going into the Playoff byes?  Who’s your pick?With the NFL rolling into its last month of the season, it’s about time to roll out our first NFL Power Rankings. With no truly elite teams rising above the others, there seem to be four teams with a legit shot at saying they should hoist the Lombardi Trophy, with five or six other teams nipping at their heels with the ability to make a legit run at the Super Bowl too. December will be about jockeying for playoff byes, figuring out the last playoff spots in the AFC and NFC, and watching to see if any team can create separation or show why they should be the favorite heading into the playoffs. Teams that were left on the outside looking in were the New York Jets, the surging Houston Texans, the Indianapolis Colts, Atlanta Falcons, and whatever team emerges from the abomination of the NFC East. Without further ado, let’s dive into the rankings.   #10 Green Bay Packers                  The Packers have hit a rough patch recently In at the 10 spot is the Green Bay Packers, a team that has hit a lull going 1-4 in their last five games, as their offense has regressed and the defense has not been able to pick up the tremendous slack brought about by the offense. As it currently stands, the Packers are not playing like a team that can seriously threaten for the Super Bowl, despite having the best quarterback alive when he’s rolling. This is an offense in disarray right now, one built on the talents of generational arm throwing to a receiver who can’t seem to create any separation from their defenders.     It doesn’t help that Aaron Rodgers has not been as accurate as he was in years past, therefore not being able to make up for his subpar receiver. The defense has finally started to turn a corner, displaying some very good performances holding three straight opponents under 20 points. If they can keep up this run going, which is not a given, it should buy time for the offense and Rodgers to start playing better come playoff time. The road to get on track starts Thursday night in Detroit, as they look to avenge a loss against the surging Lions. A loss here and true panic may start to set in the CheeseHead Nation.  #9 Minnesota Vikings The Vikings     The Packers’ NFC North brethren roll in next, as the Minnesota Vikings have been coming into their own in head coach Mike Zimmer’s second season with the team. They have been riding a very old school approach, ride the workhorse in Adrian Peterson, letting their quarterback make some plays but never really be able to put the team in a bad situation and have an improving defense slowly constrict the other team’s offense as the game goes along Adrian Peterson is back to his normal dominant self, and as it stands now, he is the only non quarterback offensive player who can drag his team into the playoffs. The Vikings aren’t as Peterson-dependent as three years ago when they rode a 2,000-yard season from the back to the playoffs, as Teddy Bridgewater is capable of making some plays. Alex Smith and the defense led by defensive tackle Linval Joseph and linebacker Anthony Barr is playing better and better as the season progresses. The next five weeks will show us if the Vikings are real or just a psuedo-playoff team that rode a hot streak into playoff position. First up, home against Seattle on Sunday.     #8 Pittsburgh Steelers The Steelers’ awesome twosome The Pittsburgh Steelers are fully entrenched as an offensive-led team, with two of the top five players at their position in quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and wide receiver Antonio Brown. Week in and week out, the Steelers ride or die with the performance of these two and more often than not, they have delivered for their team. However, as seen in last weeks loss against the Seattle Seahawks, the defense is sometimes incapable of cashing in on the exploits of their two stars on offense. They have been plauged by missed tackles and general lack of playmakers who can rise above and come up with a momentum-turning play that allows their offense to capitalize.     As the Steelers roll into December, they are going to have to rely on their two stars and the surprising D’Angelo Williams, who has stepped in admirably for the injured Le’Veon Bell and allowed the Steelers to continue rolling running the football. The Steelers roll into the last month of the season with three straight games against current playoff team, before closing up what should be a few easier games against the lesser lights of the AFC North. If the Steelers defense can perk up and play a little more opportunistically, they have a chance to really make some noise in the playoffs. #7 Kansas City Chiefs The Kansas City Chiefs     The surging Kansas City Chiefs have looked like one of the best team in football over the last five weeks, riding a five-game win streak with four double-digit wins. They are playing boa constrictor defense while riding an interception-less streak by quarterback Alex Smith who is also supplying them with some shocking throws that travel over 15 yards. Between Justin Houston, Derrick Johnson, Dontari Poe, and Eric Berry, the Chiefs have a defense that can carry them into the playoffs and all the way to the Super Bowl, provided everything breaks right for the offense. If they continue this trend of playing fabulously balanced, great defense, this team is going to be scary come playoff time. Offensively, the Chiefs need to need to find a running game that has somewhat died since Jamaal Charles got injured because Alex Smith needs a running game to truly thrive and open up his play action passing game.     What has helped Smith so much this year is the play of receiver Jeremy Maclin and tight end Travis Kelce, giving the notoriously risk-averse Smith a pair of targets capable of taking Smith’s highly accurate throws and turning them into big plays. The Chiefs have a very soft schedule to close the year, meaning they should close with four or five wins and the top AFC wild card team. #6 Seattle Seahawks Russell Wilson is the Seahawks’ trump card The two-time defending NFC Champs are lurking, playing somewhat erratically this season, but with a big win against the Steelers last week to stay above .500, they are sitting as the second wild card team in the NFC, just looking for a shot to defend their crown.     The defense is down this year from its three-year run of utter domination, but they are still a top 10 outfit with loads of playmakers among each tier who can win a playoff game themselves. Offensively, they seem to have found a running back in Thomas Rawls, who is more than capable of taking over for the injured Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson has that special ability to catch fire and rip the heart out of the opponent. With Jimmy Graham now out for the season with a torn patella, the onus will be on Wilson even more to carry a game that features an offensive line that looks like it forgets to block sometimes and a receiving core that is steady, but not above average. If the Seahawks want to get to their third Super Bowl in three years, they will have to ride a defense that needs to batten down the hatches and come close to the heights they were previously at. They don’t have a daunting schedule, and if everything breaks right, they could set up a winner take all for the NFC West title in week 17.     #5 Denver Broncos Will Manning or Osweiler start for the Broncos? After a comeback win against the previously undefeated New England Patriots last Sunday night, there is a murmur that Brock Osweiler should remain the starter even when Peyton Manning comes back from injury. You won’t get any complaint from me, as Peyton has just not been good this year and if you bring a guy back who has played that bad, I’m not sure you can expect to win when the weather starts to get colder. Osweiler, while he has not been spectacular by any means, has been able to move the offense more effectively, and, even more importantly, hold onto the football.     The shakiness at the quarterback position is somewhat muted because the Broncos have one of, if not the top defense, in the league. They have the best pair of cornerbacks in Chris Harris Jr. and Aqib Talib, and one of the best linebackers in Von Miller. If they can get DeMarcus Ware back and playing close to his early season level, this is another defense that has the ability to lead their team to the big game. They have a tough back-to-back stretch coming up on the road at Pittsburg followed by a Monday night home game against the Bengals, which will no doubt be the determining games for one of the two AFC byes. Win one and it better be vs the Bengals, win both and they should have a week off in January. #4 Cincinnati Bengals The Bengals are looking for the first playoff bye of the Marvin Lewis era     After a tough two-game stretch in mid-November, the Bengals are looking to close the season strong and secure their first playoff bye of the Marvin Lewis era. This is one of the most well-rounded teams in the league. The Bengals boast an offense that has weapons oozing from every position, offensive line included, and a defense that sits squarely in the top 10, sporting one of the top players in the league in defensive tackle Geno Atkins. For a team at the Bengals’ stage however, the regular season is a mere formality because all anyone cares about is if this regular season success will finally transfer into playoff victories. The Bengals still have games left vs the aforementioned Steelers and Broncos, games they have to win so they can enjoy an extra week of preparation and rest in January. The Bengals’ remaining three games are against some of the weaker teams in the league (Ravens, Browns, 49ers), but they must take care of these games handily to keep instilling confidence in their fan base and the rest of the league’s fans. Andy Dalton and how he handles a pass rush will be the ultimate deciding factor in how far the Bengals go this year.      #3 Carolina Panthers The Panthers, though undefeated, have faced easy opponents Blasphemy! I don’t have the only undefeated team in the league as number one in my rankings! As I look at it right now, you can put the last three teams in any order and you wouldn’t be wrong. Remember when I said that there hasn’t been a team or two which has separated itself from the field, well this manifests it right here. The Panthers have played one of the easiest schedules in the league, doing their cross-divisional matchups with the AFC South and the NFC East, the two worst divisions in football.     Now you can never take away a team’s undefeated record, but you must be able to look at it critically and see that all records are not created equal. The Panthers have been slowly dominating more and more games, through great play, both running and passing, by Cam Newtown, a dominating run game that can puncture a defense in multiple ways, and a defense that features some of the top players in the league. Cornerback Josh Morgan is the best cover man in the league, linebackers Luke Kuechley and Thomas Davis form the best 1-2 punch since Patrick Willis and Novarro Bowman, and the defensive line is deep, big, and athletic. This is a monster that seems to be building steam as the season goes on, and if they can manage to win out, very possible, they would undoubtedly go into the playoffs as the number one favorite to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl.     #2 New England Patriots The New England Patriots The Patriots aren’t dropping so much for their loss, a tough one, in bad weather, against a top five team, as much as all the injuries that the Patriots have faced in the last month or so leaves us wondering what they are going to look like if and when they get to full strength. If they get everyone back and rolling at 100%, they are, in my eyes, the best team in the league with the best coach, but getting everyone back healthy and rolling at the start of the playoffs is no easy task. All this is possible because Rob Gronkowski was able to escape a scary hit last week with nothing more than a bone bruise, because with no Gronk, there is no chance for Super Bowl.     The Patriots are still in the driver’s seat for the number one seed in the AFC, but they do have two tough games coming up, first on the road in two weeks against a Houston Texans defense that is playing awesome right now, and then, two weeks later on the road vs the New York Jets. Get past these two and they should be good to go heading into week 17 to rest their key guys vs the Miami Dolphins and absorb a loss. But they must find a way to move the football and stop the run through this run, as they watch top players seemingly drop off every week. #1 Arizona Cardinals The Cardinals have a tough-yet-achievable chance at being the number one team entering the Super Bowl     My top team is the Arizona Cardinals, an outfit that has a treasure chest of playmakers on offense and defense. They have an MVP candidate at quarterback, Carson Palmer, and a defensive player of the year candidate in defensive back Tyrann Mathieu, and those are just two of the studs they trot out every game. Patrick Peterson is playing like a top cornerback after being diagnosed with diabetes in the offseason, which allowed him to get his weight under control. The wide receivers led by the ageless Larry Fitzgerald are enjoying life in head coach Bruce Arian’s high-flying offense, and the rest of the defense has fast, smart players that execute the Cardinals aggressive game plan perfectly. The Cardinals have a very tough end of the year, taking on a St. Louis Rams team on the road this week that always give them trouble, followed by home matchups with fellow top 10 teams, Minnesota Vikings, Green Bay Packers, and Seattle Seahawks. If the Cardinals want to prove my number one ranking and head into the playoffs with a bye, the number one seed is going to be tough to get, they are going to have to knock off the Vikings and most likely go 3-1 in their other four games.

He helped the Seahawks reach the Super Bowl twice and won a ring in one of them. He was then traded to the Denver Broncos ahead of the 2022 NFL season.  The Broncos entered the year with high expectations, especially with a favorable schedule to begin the season. Russell Wilson would open his 2022 season by returning to Seattle to face off against his former team, but his homecoming was spoiled by getting booed before the start of the game and eventually leaving with a loss.        Week 2 presented another opportunity for Wilson to shine as the Broncos hosted the Houston Texans, one of the worst teams in the NFL. He received a warm welcome from the fans in Denver before the game started. But later in the game he was booed, this time by Broncos fans. He eventually led the team to a 16-9 victory.           ChuckModi@ChuckModi1Only one half played in Denver and Russell Wilson and Broncos already hearing boos. This after Russ was hearing boos last week from Seattle fans.

Rough sport. https://t.co/QD0xJm7Y8u Russell Wilson receiving boos from his new home crowd during his first home game has sparked quite a reaction from NFL fans. Fans are divided as to whether Wilson deserved the treatment from the Broncos faithful.     Many NFL fans went on Twitter to express their opinions on the situation.

They also rewarded him with a massive contract extension, making him one of the highest-paid players in the NFL. This was before playing a single snap for his new team. This seems to be where some of the fans' frustrations come from. While it has only been two games, fans are expecting more from him immediately.         Russell Wilson's final season with the Seattle Seahawks Denver Broncos QB Russell Wilson     The 2021 NFL season was Wilson's final year with the Seattle Seahawks. In that campaign, he had one of the worst statistical performances of his entire career by several measures. It was the first time he's ever finished any season of his career with a losing record, finishing 6-8 overall as the starter.     His 3,113 passing yards and 54.7 QBR were both career-lows for Russell Wilson. He also failed to eclipse 30 touchdown passes for the first time since the 2016 season. He set another career-low with just 183 ruching yards, so maybe his sudden drop in production played a factor in why the Seahawks traded him.Denver will host the San Francisco 49ers in their next match. A lot of people will be watching, judging, and maybe even booing. Keep an eye out for this one in Week 3.     ""]"
40,Josh McCown,"['Jets\' QB competition could last through 4 preseason games           FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — The New York Jets\' three-man quarterback competition could last the entire summer. Coach Todd Bowles is in no hurry to make his decision on whether it will be Josh McCown, Teddy Bridgewater or Sam Darnold under center as the starter in the team\'s regular-season opener at Detroit on Sept. 10. ""You\'ve got to play preseason games,"" Bowles said Monday. ""I\'m not into hypotheticals and nothing that hasn\'t happened yet. We\'re going to let them play. And after the fourth preseason (game), sometime that week, I\'ll make my decision and go from there. ""It\'s possible I will make my decision after the fourth week."" Usually, teams have their starters determined by the third preseason game, when the first-teamers play the bulk of the snaps. The Jets\' coach could also keep the team\'s starter under wraps until the night of the game against the Lions. ""The guy who runs out on the field (Monday night) in Week 1, we\'ll see who the starter is,"" he said.     McCown is the incumbent and still is No. 1 on the depth chart with the first unofficial list released Monday. But, Bridgewater — who\'s No. 2 — and Darnold — listed at No. 3 — saw extensive action in practice. McCown got just 10 snaps in team drills, while Bridgewater had 32 and Darnold a whopping 55, including 16 with the starting offensive line. ""They\'re going to play (preseason) games,"" Bowles said of Bridgewater and Darnold. ""And, I didn\'t see enough work Saturday (in the scrimmage at Rutgers). So we needed more work today on certain situations that Josh has been through."" Bowles said he has an idea of how the Jets will use their quarterbacks in the preseason opener against Atlanta on Friday, but wants to discuss it with his staff before revealing the plan. In fact, there\'s no guarantee that McCown will even play against the Falcons. Last summer, McCown played the first series of the preseason opener and didn\'t see the field again until three games later as the Jets gave Bryce Petty and Christian Hackenberg extended looks. This year, Bridgewater is shaking off the rust from being sidelined nearly two years because of a severe knee injury, while Darnold is the No. 3 overall pick who is considered the future of the franchise.     ""This is my 17th training camp and I\'ve done this for a while,"" McCown said. ""Obviously, we have a lot invested in the other two guys, as far as learning the offense and getting comfortable with things. It\'s good for our team for those guys to get as much work as they can."" Darnold has been in camp for just a week after missing the first three practices of camp while working out details in his contract. He quickly got up to speed and had a few solid performances last week, including in the team\'s scrimmage. But the rookie was up and down Monday in 92-degree heat with high humidity, making a few terrific plays and also coming up short on others while not looking as sharp as he had. He also showed some frustration, pumping his fist angrily after one play. ""I definitely feel a lot more comfortable calling plays in the huddle and then executing them,"" Darnold said. ""Obviously, I\'m not exactly where I want to be. There\'s always growth that needs to happen. But I\'m real excited with where I\'m at.""     So are his teammates, who have seen quite a bit of growth in just the last week. Darnold\'s ability to make quick reads on the defense and make plays on the fly is impressive. During one play, Darnold looked at his first read and saw he was covered. So, he checked the second receiver — and he, too, was covered. So, the rookie then went to his third option and connected with a wide-open running back Trenton Cannon for a touchdown. ""It\'s awesome to be able to find my groove in the offense,"" Darnold said. Darnold\'s biggest test will come against the Falcons on Friday night, when he could end up playing the entire second half. ""I have high expectations that he\'ll go out and play well,"" McCown said of his young teammate. Bridgewater echoed McCown\'s sentiments. ""Sam\'s going to be fine,"" he said. ""That guy, he\'s cool. He\'s a cool guy. Seems like a guy you can\'t break. And that\'s what you want as a quarterback. He\'s even-keeled, makes throws and it\'s like, \'Man, this guy, he\'s the real deal.\'     ""He gets it."" NOTES: Cannon had his right foot or ankle checked out by a trainer late in the practice and didn\'t return. The sixth-round pick is having a strong camp. ... Among those who didn\'t practice because of injuries: WR Quincy Enunwa, LT Kelvin Beachum, NT Steve McLendon, CB Parry Nickerson, LB David Bass, DT Deon Simon, RB Thomas Rawls, DB Kacy Rodgers. ... The Jets signed OL Alex Balducci, who was in camp with New York last summer, and waived OL Austin Golson. ... Rookie Nathan Shepherd, a third-rounder, is listed as a starter at DE on the team\'s first unofficial preseason depth chart.

The Super Bowl-winning quarterback is now being called upon by New York Jets fans to supplant Zach Wilson as the team\'s starting quarterback. This comes after the Jets had a total of 103 yards of total offense in their Week 11 loss to the New England Patriots.   Wilson went nine out of 22 passing for 77 yards and a quarterback rating of 50.8.

After the loss to the Patriots, Zach Wilson was asked by a reporter if his play let down the Jets offense. Wilson replied: “No. Are you serious?"" In the 2017-2018 season, quarterbacks Josh McCown and Bryce Petty threw for a combined 60 yards versus the Denver Broncos in Week 14. All-time, the team has thrown for under 100 yards in 55 games.  Should Joe Flacco become the Jets starter for the rest of the season? While head coach Robert Saleh seems to be sticking with Zach Wilson, the numbers show that the team has played better under Joe Flacco. The former Baltimore Ravens star has started three games this season in place of Wilson. In those three games, Flacco threw for a combined 901 yards, five touchdowns and three interceptions. So far, Wilson has 1,279 yards, four touchdowns, and five interceptions. Joe Flacco also has a lot more experience starting games in this league with 179 career starts and 163 with the Ravens in 11 seasons.      When Jets rookie wide receiver Garrett Wilson was asked how bad the offense was in Week 11, he didn\'t hold back. Garrett Wilson said: ""This sh*t is not okay. Straight up, it is not okay,\'\' the first-round pick said. ""How many total yards did we have (103)? That shit is not going to fly. We got the dudes. It\'s time to be consistent. It\'s time to win the games we should win."" Wilson has thrown for under 200 yards passing in a game this season four times, including the loss versus the Patriots. He also hasn\'t thrown a touchdown in four of his last five starts, which was the case against the Patriots. In Week Nine against the Jets, the former BYU star had his lone game with a passer rating of over 100 (101.8 versus the Buffalo Bills).        The New York Jets are still in the playoff hunt with a 6 - 4 record this season and in third place in the AFC East. Will Salah replace Zach WIlson with Joe Flacco if Wilson continues to struggle?        The Jets drafted Wilson second overall in the 2021 NFL Draft. We\'ll see if Saleh makes the move as the 2022-2023 season rolls on.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit SNY, CBS Sports, and H/T Sportskeeda.     ', ""Best Quarterback Rooms in NFL - 2018 Edition  The quarterback position is arguably the most important position in the NFL, while the backup quarterback position is the second most important position. The spot has not been in a better situation than 2018 in a long time. The quarterback climate has a perfect mix of veterans and new blood.  The ranking for the quarterback room has taken into account the starter, backup quarterback, scout team QB, supporting cast, offensive system and teams' expected run-to-pass ratio along with past performance and history of injury.        The article ranks the teams by scoring each quarterback and taking the cumulative score as a marker. The third quarterback is only taken into account if they are a viable trade bait or hold any chance to start during the regular season.           #32 Jacksonville Jaguars Starter - Blake Bortles, Backup - Cody Kessler Blake Bortles will try to not let his defense down It is one of the very few quarterback-proof rosters in the NFL. The team will look to lean on the run game in the offense this season. Blake Bortles has to improve his mechanics to move out the bottom of the list and Kessler will need to shake off his winless season with the Browns.     #31 Carolina Panthers Starter - Cam Newton, Backup - Taylor Heinicke Newton will have to become the Superman from 2015 Cam has to be the Superman again under new ownership. Panthers have Taylor Heinicke as their backup. If you are thinking who that person is, you are not alone. #30 Kansas City Chiefs Starter - Pat Mahomes, Backup - Chad Henne Mahomes will have to be the present and future of the squad     Pat Mahomes has not started a relevant game in the NFL. He has potential but Texas Tech's air raid offense is not the best to go by. Chad Henne couldn't beat out Blake Bortles at his worst, which is not the best news for Chiefs faithful. #29 Miami Dolphins Starter - Ryan Tannehill, Backup - Brock Osweiler Tannehill will be playing for his job Brock Osweiler can't be described as the best backup policy for Tannehill, who is coming back from a knee injury last season. The coaching staff is in the hot seat and sharing the division with Patriots does not help.     #28 Washington Redskins Starter - Alex Smith, Backup - Colt McCoy Alex Smith will have to bring his MVP season from Kansas City Alex Smith might live up to his MVPesque season from last time but McCoy would live on as a below average backup QB forever. Alex Smith ain't the worst option after Kirk Cousins left. #27 Houston Texans Starter - Deshaun Watson. Backup - Brandon Weeden Deshaun Watson will have to be the player he was before the injury     Houston has Weeden as their backup to their sophomore superstar coming off an ACL injury, O'Brien would hope for a better option than that. The team hopes to stay fit next season and do some damage in AFC. #26 Dallas Cowboys Starter - Dak Prescott, Backup - Mike White, Cooper Rush Prescott will get his sidekick in Ezekial Elliott back for the season Dak and Zeke form a formidable offense but the Cowboys quarterback room could do better than Mike White and Rush. Jason Garrett must be hoping for Kellen Moore (probably not).     #25 Cincinnati Bengals Starter - Andy Dalton, Backup - Matt Barkley Dalton will have to bemoreconsistent upcoming season Cincinnati Bengals have changes looming in front of them, the coaching staff is in the hot seat and the QB room ain't helping. Andy Dalton has been used to define the term 'average' all over the NFL dictionary and Barkley never lived up to his high school potential. #24 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Starter - Winston, Backup - Ryan Fitzpatrick Tampa Bay will not have Winston for the first 3 weeks per suspension     Winston will serve his ban and Ryan Fitzpatrick will be QB-1 in the depth chart, sounds depressing, probably is. #23 Baltimore Ravens Starter/ Backup - Joe Flacco, Lamar Jackson. The QB competition is in full swing at Ravens camp Ravens' coaching has been immensely impressed with rookie Lamar Jackson. The reports from preseason indicate that Joe Flacco has been showing more initiation as well. Ravens will be looking to capitalize on a soft AFC. #22 Chicago Bears Starter - Mitchell Trubisky, Backup - Chase Daniels Trubisky can lead Bears to playoffs and become the greatest franchise QB     Bears have a new offensive system and Chase Daniel as the backup, who has come from the Chiefs system that Matt Nagy will be running. Trubisky needs to live up to his draft pedigree and Bears can easily jump to the next tier. #21 Buffalo Bills Starter - AJ McCarron, Backup - Josh Allen, Nathan Peterman The team will hope for Josh Allen to win the starting job Bills brought in McCarron from Bengals as an insurance policy to their Rookie, Josh Allen. Bills have an average starter, one raw rookie, and a backup with starting capabilities in Peterman. No one should be surprised if everyone gets a start in Buffalo.     #20 Denver Broncos Starter - Case Keenum, Backup - Paxton Lynch, Chad Kelly Keenum will hop to fill the big shoes of Peyton Manning Case Keenum had a career year last season but he won't have the similar support cast as Minnesota. Paxton Lynch has bust written all over him and won't even command a conditional pick in return. #19 Tennessee Titans Starter - Marcus Mariota, Backup - Blaine Gabbert Mariota needs to bounce back from a dreadful last season     Titans have been a run first team but Mariota needs to improve his play for them to compete against Houston in the division. Gabbert can be a great backup in the correct system with his cannon arm and great mobility. #18 New York Giants Starter - Eli Manning, Backup - Davis Webb/ Kyle Lauletta Eli Manning will have to deliver with the run game to support Eli Manning has lost way too many steps to be a top tier QB but his stellar offensive sidekicks should take him to the belief land. Davis Webb has been making a lot of noise this offseason along with Kyle Lauletta at the backup position.     #17 Oakland Raiders Starter - Derek Carr, Backup - Connor Cooks Derek Carr will have to gel into Gruden's offense sooner than later Derek Carr underachieved last season. Cook and Carr will soon realize that life under Gruden is not as rosy as Gruden Camp. The team has Jeff Fisher vibes of finishing 8-8. #16 Detroit Lions Starter - Matthew Stafford, Backup - Matt Cassel Stafford can rise up to the next level     Stafford has one of the best arm seen in the sport but he needs a better support cast. How does Matt Cassel still have a job in NFL, even though it is as a backup? #15 Atlanta Falcons Starter - Matt Ryan, Backup - Matt Schaub Matt Ryan can bring the Falcons to the top Matt Ryan has had a legendary career till now, without winning the big one. The bad news is that they have Matt Schaub as the backup. #14 New Orleans Saints Starter - Drew Brees, Backup - Tom Savage     Drew Brees will look to take Saints further than last time Saints are moving on to a more run-heavy offense which might help the longevity of Brees. Saints are one of the big boys of NFC and Brees would love to make one last run before father time gets him. Tom Savage is not what you dream of as a backup but Saints don't have an option. Hill is the scout team QB who is turning heads at camp. #13 Seattle Seahawks Starter - Russell Wilson, Backup - Austin Davis     Russell Wilson will look for some help from the run offense Russell Wilson is a one-man offense for Seahawks with zero run game, no O-line help and below par receiving core. Russell Wilson does it all but sadly Austin Davis can't. The diminishing quality of Seahawks defense makes their chances of playoff dim. #12 Los Angeles Rams LA Rams - Starter - Jared Goff, Backup - Sean Mannion Goff will look to improve on his stellar performance last season     Jared Goff took a big leap last season. Sean McVay has been a godsend to Rams offense. Sean Mannion is not the best backup option but he has been in the system and a good subordinate to the young future of Los Angeles. Goff is a sneaky MVP candidate with Gurley by the sides. #11 Pittsburgh Steelers Starter - Roethlisberger, Backup - Mason Rudolph/ Landry Jones Roethlisberger will look to capitalize on Bell's last year in Pittsburgh Steelers have a complete offense led by Big Ben. His two quarterback understudies are raw and with minimal arm talent. Roethlisberger has been injured in bits and pieces over the last few seasons and the weak backup situation doesn't help the Steelers.     #10 Los Angeles Chargers Starter - Rivers, Backup - Geno Smith/ Cardale Jones Rivers will be looking for some luck and support from the fans Rivers is a great starter with a competent backup in Geno Smith. The run game led by Melvin Gordon with the receiving talent of Keenan Allen would be a handful for any defense. If the team stays fit, they can be a challenger for the AFC title. #09 San Francisco 49ers Starter - Jimmy Garoppolo, Backup - CJ Bethard Jimmy G will look to become Jimmy GQ     Garoppolo ended the 49ers season last year with 5 wins. The only way for the 49ers is up. Kyle Shanahan has one of the most sophisticated offenses in the league. CJ Bethard as the backup is a little suspect. Bay area is waiting for Jimmy G to become Jimmy Jesus. #8 Cleveland Browns Starter - Tyrod Taylor, Backup - Baker Mayfield/ Drew Stanton Baker and Tyrod will look to bring back the glory at Cleveland Browns were the worst team in Football but they have added to every position on the pitch. Taylor is a dependable QB, who can give you 5 wins on his worst day. Baker is the future with great football ethics and Drew Stanton will be a great third QB while developing a rookie. Browns look like a sneaky break out team for the upcoming season.     #07 Green Bay Packers Starter - Aaron Rodgers, Backup - DeShone Kizer Rodgers will be without his favorite wide receiver next season Rodgers has been known to hide most of the blemishes of his team. Packers traded for Kizer to be the backup, who was the QB of a 16 loss team. The addition of Jimmy Graham at tight end position will come as a great help after Nelson left. #06 New England Patriots Starter - Tom Brady, Backup - Brian Hoyer/ Danny Etling Brady will look to defy father time for one more season     Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time. Brian Hoyer is definitely not the greatest backup quarterback of all time. Brady's age is a sign of trouble but he is the reigning MVP of the league. Patriots have drafted Danny Etling in the late rounds who could turn up to be a great option for the future. #05 Indianapolis Colts Starter - Andrew Luck, Backup - Jacoby Brissett Luck finally looks set to be back alongside promising backup in Brissett If Andrew Luck wasn't coming back from injury, Colts could have been the top team in this exercise. Brissett has been a great trade by Colts. Luck has started training again and the revamped offensive line won't hurt either. The future looks bright for the franchise.     #04 New York Jets Starter/ Backup - Darnold, Josh McCown, Bridgewater Jets will have one of the most balanced quarterback room No one expected Jets to end up this high on the list but they have a great experienced starter and teacher in Josh McCown. They arguably got the best quarterback from the recent draft in Sam Darnold and they signed Teddy Bridgewater for free in the offseason. Bridgewater is the biggest trade asset in the league and front-runner for the comeback player of the year. Jets have stability at the position for the first time in a long time.     #03 Minnesota Vikings Starter - Kirk Cousins, Backup - Trevor Siemian Cousins will be expected to live up to his price tag The future looks bright for the franchise. Kirk Cousins is underrated even after being the costliest player in football and Siemian is as good a backup as any. Vikings will try to make the run in a loaded NFC. #02 Arizona Cardinals Starter - Sam Bradford, Backup - Josh Rosen/ Mike Glennon Rosen will look to earn the starts while Bradford needs to stay fit     The Cardinals have one of the most polished QB coming out of College in Rosen. Sam Bradford can be a top 15 quarterback when fit. The quarterback room compliments each other, unlike any other team. Cardinals can shock a lot of people next season. #01 Philadelphia Eagles Starter - Carson Wentz, Backup - Nick Foles Eagles would love another Philly special, with Wentz this time Nick Foles just won Philly the Superbowl, while the future MVP of the league (Wentz) was sidelined with an injury. Eagles have things sorted till Foles gets traded for too many draft picks. The Eagles QB room might just help them reach the mountaintop again. The in-depth look into every quarterback room made me realize that Matt Cassel, Matt Schaub, and Landry Jones will keep having backup jobs in 2096 and no one will ever notice. In conclusion. my biggest fear is that Blake Bortles will end up winning the Superbowl and make this article as irrelevant as his throwing motion.

Some come from colleges ranked below the FBS. Those that are not in the FBS are in the FCS.   For the uninitiated, there is a complete world of college football that follows a playoff format similar to the NFL with a regular season, seeding, byes, and a larger number of teams allowed into the playoffs.        It's here that some of the big names in the NFL get their start. Here are the top five players representing the FCS in the NFL this year.            FCS alumni currently tearing it up in the NFL  #1 - Jimmy Garoppolo (Eastern Illinois) Jimmy Garoppolo made his way to the NFL via a soujorn at Eastern Illinois. Since entering the NFL, he has played under Tom Brady and has played in a Super Bowl. He has had trouble staying healthy, but when he's fit, Garoppolo is a world beater in the NFL. He is 24-8 in his career as a starter. In his last full season, Garoppolo threw for 27 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Fantasy fans are hoping Trey Lance gets the nod over Jimmy Garoppolo sooner rather than later https://t.co/hzrcThrjmS— Sports Illustrated (@SInow) July 10, 2021      #2 - Carson Wentz (North Dakota State) Carson Wentz went to North Dakota State. For those who do not follow the FCS, North Dakota State is like the New England Patriots or the Alabama Crimson Tide of the FCS; they are in the national championship game nearly every season. Carson Wentz may have had his fill of playoff appearances in college. He's put together three great regular seasons in his career, but come playoff time, he always seems to suffer an injury.         In 2017, Wentz got hurt near the end of the season, leading to an improbable Nick Foles run. In 2018, Wentz had another great season before getting hurt before the playoffs for the second time in a row. In 2019, Wentz saw lighting strike for a third time as he played well enough to get the team into the playoffs before getting hurt, leading to Josh McCown's only playoff performance of his career.  #3 - Cooper Kupp (Eastern Washington University) Cooper Kupp set many records in college while at Eastern Washington University. His outstanding play carried over into the NFL after getting drafted in the third round by the Los Angeles Rams.  Cooper Kupp has been solid in his career. He's earned around 1,000 yards in three of his four seasons. While he suffered a major injury in 2018 that prohibited him from racking up a full season of production, he has otherwise been quite reliable.  #4 - Ryan Fitzpatrick (Harvard)     Ryan Fitzpatrick may not act like it, but he went to Harvard. Fitzpatrick has played for seven NFL teams, including the Washington Football Team. In his career, he is 59-86-1.  He's thrown for 223 touchdowns and 169 interceptions. He very well may have had one of the best throws of the decade last season when he was able to hit a receiver deep down the field while getting his head turned in the opposite direction. #5 - Samson Ebukam (Eastern Washington University) Trey Lance may nab this spot next season, but right now Samson Ebukam is responsible for one of the best defensive games by a pass rusher ever.  That display came against the Kansas City Chiefs in the classic 54-51 Monday Night Football game. According to ESPN, Ebukam became the first player in recorded history to have a sack, interception and multiple touchdowns in a game.Super Bowl LIII - New England Patriots v Los Angeles RamsToday, Ebukam is a member of the San Francisco 49ers and is playing on a multi-year deal valued at $12 million. Ebukam has 150 total tackles and 14 sacks in his career.     "", 'Carolina Panthers NFL Draft Predictions: 3 elite prospects Panthers should target in 2023 NFL Draft  The Carolina Panthers are fresh off making the first blockbuster trade of the 2023 NFL draft.   They traded away the No. 9, No. 61, 2024 first and a 2025 second pick, and receiver D.J. Moore for the first overall pick of the 2023 NFL draft. Now that\'s out of the way, it\'s time for the Panthers to select a suitable first-overall pick to kick off a long overdue rebuild.        The odds say that the Panthers will use the first overall pick on a franchise QB, and there are at least three to consider.Bryce Young, C.J. Stroud and Anthony Richardson are all popular choices. So, we\'ll find out in a couple of weeks, but in the meantime, let\'s showcase our mock draft for the 2023 NFL draft.            Three elite prospects Carolina Panthers should target 2023 NFL Draft So, these are our favorite three targets for the Carolina Panthers in the 2023 NFL draft according to their needs for the immediate future: First round, 1st pick: Bryce Young, QB, Alabama Bryce Young, the best passer in the 2023 NFL draft class, is no joke. The Alabama Crimson Tide alum is one of the best quarterbacks of Nick Saban\'s illustrious coaching career, and he has earned his spot despite his slender frame.  Young is a Week 1 starter who can improve the players around him. He\' super calm when facing pressure, reads defenses like an NFL veteran, and knows how to spur a locker room. Simply put, he\'s the most polished quarterback prospect in 2023.     Young would be coached by offensive gurus Frank Reich and Josh McCown. It would be an awesome coaching roster for a young QB, and Carolina\'s offense is an enticing proposition. While the receiving roster needs work, there\'s immense confidence that the Panthers will find ways to fix that this off-season.  Second round, 39th pick: Josh Downs, WR, North Carolina North Carolina wide receiver Josh Downs could be an incredible prospect to add to a weak Carolina Panthers wideout room. He could instantly step in as the Panthers\' slot receiver and become a main target for QB1 Young or whoever they draft.  While most shorter quarterbacks usually struggle to throw over the middle, that was one of Young\'s strengths in college. Reich would run a scheme that racks up plenty of snappy throws and put Young out on the move.  Third round, 93rd overall: Byron Young, EDGE, Tennessee Bryon Young is a raw but freakishly talented 6\' 3"" defensive lineman. His performances at the NFL Combine were awesome, and he should translate his college skills to the NFL. While his role will be limited as a rookie, defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero knows the importance of having a wide array of rushers. Moreover, he would get premium mentoring from Brian Burns. For a late round-three pick, he would impact Carolina Panthers\' improving defense in his first season.     ', ""5 rookie quarterbacks who won in the playoffs ft. Ben Roethlisberger and more  Saturday's Wild Card playoff game saw rookie quarterback Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers defeat the Seattle Seahawks 41-23. It was an impressive display that raised the question of how often quarterbacks lead their teams to playoff wins in their debut seasons.  While many have led their teams to the playoffs, only a select few have managed to achieve the feat of winning a playoff game in their first season. Here is a list of 5 quarterbacks to have won a playoff game in their rookie season.                   #1. Ben Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh Steelers (2004 season)  AFC Wild Card Playoffs - Former Pittsburgh Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Ben Roethlisberger in the first round of the 2004 NFL draft. Initially, he was the third-choice quarterback on the team behind Tommy Maddox and Charlie Batch. However, due to an injury to Batch during the preseason (and poor performances) and an injury to Maddox in Week 3, Roethlisberger was given an opportunity. He led the team to win a playoffs game in his rookie season.

He made his playoff debut in the Divisional round against the New York Jets and helped lead the team to victory in overtime with a game-winning field goal. The Steelers lost the AFC championship game to eventual Super Bowl champions the New England Patriots. #2. Joe Flacco, Baltimore Ravens (2008 season)  New York Jets Joe Flacco     The Baltimore Ravens selected Joe Flacco as the 18th overall pick in 2008 NFL draft. Flacco was meant to be the third-choice quarterback, but due to injuries to starter Kyle Boller and an illness to Tro Smit, Flacco was given the nod. Flacco finished his rookie season with a pass completion percentage of 60.0%, 2,971 yards, and 16 touchdowns. Flacco and the Ravens secured their place in the playoffs and defeated the Miami Dolphins 27-9 in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. Flacco became the first quarterback to win two consecutive playoff games in their rookie season after a 13-10 divisional-round victory over the Tennessee Titans. The Ravens lost the AFC championship game against the Steelers 14-23. #3. Mark Sanchez, New York Jets (2009 season)  Jacksonville Jaguars v New York Jets     Mark Sanchez was taken in the first round of the 2009 NFL draft. The New York Jets traded their first- and second-round selections, as well as three players, to the Cleveland Browns to take him fifth overall. The 2009 season began on a high note for Sanchez, winning three consecutive Pepsi Rookie of the Week awards in the first three weeks of the campaign. He also made history by becoming the first rookie quarterback to start and win his first three NFL games. Warren Sharp@SharpFootballlast Jets QB with a winning record in New York was Mark Sanchez8-12: Zach Wilson1-7: Joe Flacco1-2: Mike White13-25: Sam Darnold0-2: Luke Falk0-1: Trevor Siemian5-11: Josh McCown1-6: Bryce Petty13-14: Ryan Fitzpatrick1-2: Mike Vick12-18: Geno Smith33-29: Mark Sanchez1516133last Jets QB with a winning record in New York was Mark Sanchez8-12: Zach Wilson1-7: Joe Flacco1-2: Mike White13-25: Sam Darnold0-2: Luke Falk0-1: Trevor Siemian5-11: Josh McCown1-6: Bryce Petty13-14: Ryan Fitzpatrick1-2: Mike Vick12-18: Geno Smith33-29: Mark Sanchez     However, the remainder of the season was not as smooth. In Week 4, Sanchez threw an interception that led to a 99-yard touchdown. In Week 6, he threw five interceptions in a 16-13 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Sanchez and the Jets rallied to finish the regular season with a 9-7 record, securing a spot in the playoffs. In the Wild Card round, they secured a 24-14 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. Sanchez and the team went on to win the Divisional round game against the San Diego Chargers 17-14. Sanchez became the second rookie quarterback in NFL history to win his first two consecutive playoff games following Joe Flacco in 2008. Despite their success, the Jets eventually lost their AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts with a score of 30-17, giving up an 11-point lead. #4. Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks (2012 season) Russell Wilson - St. Louis Rams v Seattle Seahawks, 2012     Russell Wilson was selected by the Seahawks as the 75th overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft. After competing for the starter position with veteran quarterback Matt Flynn and Tarvaris Jackson, Wilson was given the nod for the 2021 season. Wilson threw for 3,118 yards and 26 touchdowns in his rookie season, tying the record set by Peyton Manning for most touchdown passes by a rookie. Wilson's ability as a running quarterback contributed to 489 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. Led by Wilson, the Seahawks secured a playoff spot and went on to win their wild-card round game against the Washington Redskins by a score of 24-14. Wilson had a solid performance, throwing for 187 yards and rushing for 67 yards. They would eventually lose the divisional round game against the Atlanta Falcons by a field goal with 31 seconds left on the clock. #5. Brock Purdy, San Francisco 49ers (2022 season)  NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Seattle Seahawks v San Francisco 49ers     Brock Purdy was selected as the 262nd overall pick in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL draft. After injuries to initial starters Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo, Purdy was given the nod to start in Week 13. To the amazement of many, Purdy put up impressive numbers, throwing for 1,374 yards and 14 total touchdowns in five games as the 49ers starting quarterback. The 49ers met the Seahawks in the Wild Card game of the playoffs and won 41-23.Purdy threw for 332 yards and three passing touchdowns, as well as scoring a rushing touchdown. Purdy will have the chance to become the third rookie quarterback to win consecutive playoff games.     "", ""“Major red flag” – NFL fans label Anthony Richardson a bust after Pro Day fiasco  NFL coaches and scouts flocked to Gainesville, Florida on Thursday morning to watch the highly anticipated Pro Day for Gators quarterback Anthony Richardson.   With the speculation that Richardson could not only be a first-round draft pick but also a possible first overall selection, all eyes were on his performance. But, there was one particular mishap from the quarterback that had many scratching their heads.                     He threw one throw so high that it hit the roof of the Gators practice facility. While the it may be lower in the practice facility than it is in NFL facilities and stadiums, hitting the roof shows that it was an inacurate throw, something that NFL coaches and scouts don't want to see. NFL fans on Twitter certainly got a laugh out of the mishap from the Gators quarterback. Some call it a red flag and show major inaccuracy issues. Others joked that he would be perfect for the Carolina Panthers or the Las Vegas Raiders.     While it was clearly a mistake, it may not exactly impact his draft status on the boards at this time. Anthony Richardson did end his Pro Day with a dart down the field to his receiver, which would be an impressive touchdown pass.

Making the Raiders another possible team that is drafting in the top ten.         When the Carolina Panthers did arrive, they brought in quite the group to watch the quarterback. Not only was head coach Frank Reich in attendance, he brought passing game coordinator Parks Frazier, quarterbacks coach Josh McCown and offensive coordinator Thomas Brown.It's also the same group they brought to watch Kentucky's Will Levis and Ohio State's C.J. Stroud. Whether the team is still deciding, or if they aren't showing their cards yet, remains to be seen on draft night.     "", ""NFL 2018: Ranking the new QB situations for 2018 season  The 2018 off-season began even before the Super Bowl 52 was played. The Washington Redskins agreed to trade for quarterback Alex Smith from the Kansas City Chiefs in late January thus resetting the QB market even before the season ended. Two teams already had two new quarterbacks before the Eagles could beat out the defending champions in February.  The trade freed the embattled ex-Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins to sign with the Minnesota Vikings in Free agency. The Vikings, who made it to the NFC Championship game, had three starting-caliber quarterbacks and let them all hit the free agency and signed Cousins to a first-ever full guaranteed contract.        Weeks prior to the start of free agency it was obvious that the Cousins-Vikings marriage is inevitable, which prompted the MVP of Vikings season Case Keenum to struck a deal with Denver Broncos even before the Cousins deal was finalized. This Keenum deal started the domino effect with many teams that are in the QB market started making deals.           Cleveland Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor from the Buffalo Bills, one of many trades they made this offseason. Arizona Cardinals signed Sam Bradford, New York Jets Signed Teddy Bridgewater and then traded him to the New Orleans Saints after an amazing preseason. AJ McCarron signed with the Bills and got beat out by rookie Josh Allen to become the starter which prompted the Bills to trade him to Oakland. Speaking of rookies, the 2018 draft had as many as Five QBs taken in round 1. By Week 4, four of the 5 are starting and the fifth QB is already seeing some game action in trick plays.     Including both the Veterans and Rookies, there are as many as Eight teams who had new Quarterbacks starting for them this year. Let's take a look at how these QBs fared so far with their new teams. Let's start with a Bonus player, the man who took the league by surprise and then crash landed in week 4:  BONUS: Ryan Fitzpatrick (2-2)  Oh, where to start. When I first started to think about this article after week 2, I had him competing for the number 1 spot with the current number 1 and then week 4 happened and the head coach Dirk Koetter has announced that Jameis Winston will be starting after the week 5 bye.     Since, FitzMagic is just a placeholder for Winston, who was serving his 3-game suspension, I decided not to include him in the rankings but thought he deserved a shout-out for his performance through the first three weeks. He went 2-2 in his starts when no one expected him to be anything better than 1-3. He faced three playoff teams from last year and went 2-1 in those games and came close to being 3-0 while trying to make an epic comeback against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 3. He posted 400 yards in each of his first three games, an NFL record. But week 4 proved why Fitzpatrick is who he is, a journeyman quarterback. The four-game stretch should help him get more money in the next offseason and will be a highly paid backup QB. #8 Josh Rosen/Sam Bradford, Arizona Cardinals (0-4)      Two teams have already started two quarterbacks who were not on their roster last season, one of them is Arizona Cardinals. Cardinals, who saw both their quarterback and head coach retire after last season had a complete overhaul in coaching and QB room. The added three quarterbacks including Mike Glennon. Sam Bradford, who is coming off injuries, signed a 1 year 20 million dollar contract and became a presumed starter. But, the Cardinals are off to a terrible start losing out in all the three starts prompting the change to go with the rookie Josh Rosen. Bradford in his three starts completed 62.5% of his passes for 400 yards and two touchdowns. But, he also had four INTs to his name. Bradford, couldn't move the ball well under Mike McCoy's game plan. He struggled in the first 2 games where the offense only scored 6 points in total. He started off well in the Week 3 matchup against the Chicago Bears where he tossed two TDs to start the game, but then couldn't find the momentum in the rest of the game which paved the way for the rookies Josh Rosen to come in the fourth quarter and try to win the game which was a very close contest.         Rosen was named starter for week 4 and quietly had an impressive debut. Rosen probably threw for only 180 yards but kept the Cardinals in the game without making any stupid mistakes. Cardinals eventually lost to the Russell Wilson's Seahawks, but had a glimpse of their bright future. The Cardinals running game needs to be picked up. The O-line has been one of the worst in the league, which handcuffed one of the elite tailbacks in David Johnson.     This Cardinals offense reminds me of 2016 Rams team which made Todd Gurley, Jared Goff and Case Keenum do nothing. This Cardinals offense is doing the same to David Johnson, Josh Rosen and Larry Fitzerald. Look for a coaching change to come this off season even though it is the first season as a head coach for Steve Wilks, at the very least the OC needs to be changed. With the correct play caller, this offense is capable of some high flying action ala Chiefs, Rams and the Texans. #7 Josh Allen/Nathan Peterman, Buffalo Bills (1-3)      Buffalo Bills had one of the strangest QB competition in NFL this offseason. They had three quarterbacks in the battle for the starting spot during the training camp. All thought that it would be AJ McCarron but instead as the preseason approached McCarron became third stringer and expendable, thus his trade to Raiders. The Bill surprisingly announced Nathan Peterman over the rookie Josh Allen as the starter for week 1, but Peterman repeated his first start performance from last year when he threw for 5 picks. He threw 2 picks and scored nothing, which led for the rookie Josh Allen to take the reigns. Allen in his three starts the next three weeks, completed only 53.4% of passes throwing just two touchdowns with four picks. His best game came in week 3 when the Buffalo Bills stunned the world by beating the Minnesota Vikings. Allen had three total TDs, 2 of them coming on the ground, showing off his athleticism in that game. But, he came back to earth in week 4, throwing 2 picks against an average Packers defense.     Allen, as expected, is raw and playing like a typical rookie. In an ideal scenario, he could use a redshirt season before taking over the reigns like Patrick Mahomes, but he did not have the luxury of learning under someone like Alex Smith, instead, the situation has thrust him into starting role early. He is going to have some growing pains but if week 3 is any indication he is going to be big in long term. #6 Baker Mayfield/Tyrod Taylor, Cleveland Browns (1-2-1)      This is the second team in the list that already had two starters who were not on the roster last season. The Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor during the offseason. A month later the Browns picked Baker Mayfield with the number 1 overall pick. Mayfield was supposed to be redshirted this season with Taylor holding the place for the year at least until the Browns are out of Playoff contention. But with Taylor's concussion in Week 3 Thursday Night matchup against the Jets, Mayfield came in late second quarter and helped Browns mount the comeback and give the franchise its first win in 17 games. Browns had a great start to the season, mostly thanks to the defense which stifled Ben Roethlisberger in Week 1. Drew Brees also had a tough time playing against this defense. Browns started 0-1-1 in the first two weeks and entered week 3 as favorites for the first time in almost two seasons.     Tyrod Taylor apart from a couple of plays had a tough start to his Browns tenure. That bad form continued in week 3. The first half of that game was unwatchable with Tyrod under center. But, when Mayfield came into the game, the dynamics changed. Browns offense is fun to watch after a very long time, He made the plays that Tyrod Taylor would hesitate to do.     Mayfield brought the life back into the Browns fans. The stadium was lit during the Second Half. That Second Half started a new era in Cleveland Football History. Mayfield was named a starter for Week 4 and beyond as expected. On his first start though Mayfield came back to earth against the Oakland Raiders.     Mayfield threw for two touchdowns but also had four turnovers which resulted in 21 Raiders points. Mayfield showed off his athletic skills, but also showed it was premature to make him a HOF player after that amazing second half in week 3. It is going to be interesting to see how the Browns and Mayfield will continue the rest of the way in all of a sudden new look AFC North that has Steelers tied at the bottom of the table instead of the top. #5 Sam Darnold, New York Jets (1-3)      Darnold was the only rookie quarterback who was named the starting quarterback prior to week 1. He had to earn the job in a battle with Teddy Bridgewater. Both Darnold and Bridgewater had a good preseason leading the Jets to trade Bridgewater to Saints and announce Darnold as a starter. Unlike other rookies, Darnold had an impressive start to his career. He completed 76% of his passes for 198 yards, 2 TDs and a pick with an impressive 116.8 rating. But after that, he came back crashing to earth. He had 4 more INTs to only 2 TDs in the remaining three games.         Darnold had his first career game without any interception in week 4 against a very good Jacksonville Jaguars defense. That should be considered a minor victory for a rookie QB who is struggling after a strong start. Unlike other quarterbacks, Darnold isn't surrounded by high flying talent. His receivers and the running backs are well below league average. In order to succeed long-term, the Jets need to provide weapons around him as the Bears did with Mitchell Trubisky this year, which helped him go off in week 4. Quincy Enunwa and the receivers need to step up and help the rookie QB to have any shot this year. Patriots, who had a slow start are getting back their groove right in time with Julian Edelman returning from his suspension. Jets will be facing a tough Denver defense in week 5. if Darnold could escape that game without a Turnover, they could have a very good chance to escape with a W. He could take some pointer from his veteran backup and mentor Josh McCown.     #4 Alex Smith, Washington Redskins (2-1)  Alex Smith has been his typical self to start the 2018 season with his new team the Washington Redskins. He has a completed nearly 70% of his passes and scored 4 Touchdowns with a pick and a 2-1 record. That is a typical Alex Smith stat line. Smith had a good start for his redskins tenure against the Cardinals, where he threw for 255 yards and a couple of TDs. But, in week 2 against a mediocre Colts defense Smith couldn't find the endzone even though completing nearly 72% of his passes. He and the Redskins bounced back in week 3 against the Packers where he outplayed Rodgers to upset the Packers.     Smith success correlates with the success of the running game. in the two wins, the Redskins new running back, Adrian Peterson rushed for nearly hundred yards and has scored a TD at least once, in the loss against the Colts he rushed 11 times for just 20 yards. Smith is one of those QBs who needs all the dominoes around him should work efficiently to find the success. He does not commit any back-breaking mistakes but he does not even get you out of the gate if fallen behind. NFC East is vulnerable right now and Redskins sit on top of the division even with their bye on week 4. The one difference between the Chiefs and the Redskins is that they lack that dynamic pass catcher that could help a QB out. Jordan Reed had some success in the wins but Jamison Crowder has yet to find the rhythm. It will be interesting to see if Smith can help out the Redskins to remain on top of a very close NFC East race as he did with the Chiefs the past few Seasons.     #3 Case Keenum, Denver Broncos (2-2)  Case Keenum, an undrafted free agent out of the University of Houston, had one of the most unprecedented journeys to become the starting quarterback of Denver Broncos. After his amazing career year in 2017 with the Vikings, Keenum signed a 2 year 36 million dollar contract with the Broncos. But, so far Keenum was not able to replicate the kind of success he had last season. Keenum had a total of 7 INTs in 2017 season has already thrown for 6 so far in four games and just tossing three touchdowns. Keenum's decision making at times seem erratic. He is trying to do more than what the defenses are giving him.     Even with his erratic play Keenum found some early success in the first two weeks by having two clutch game winning drives, which Broncos did not have last season. He almost had a third game winning drive on the MNF, week 4 against the Chiefs. He overthrew a wide open Demaryius Thomas which could have resulted in a game winning TD. In the next play he did connect to the rookie Courtland Sutton in an old-school hook and ladder play call.         Keenum, just like Smith is a game manager who needs to have a better player all around him. He has a solid running game with the two rookies, Royce Freeman and Phillip Lindsay sharing the work load, but the receivers apart from Emmanuel Sanders haven't really stepped up. The reason for having Keenum just a tick above the Last year with Vikings Keenum had Thielen and Diggs who had some amazing catches that helped out Keenum. Keenum knows that Demaryius Thomas is no longer in that elite group and need to be more careful forcing the ball into the tight coverage. The reason I have Keenum a tick above Alex Smith is that of his Clutch performance in weeks 1 and 2 and his NFC Championship game appearance just a few months back. I still think that Keenum is an upgrade to what Denver had last season and could help them have a fighting chance to at least grab the Wildcard spot in the playoffs.     There is no panic yet in Denver, there is a lot of season left and with no viable back up option left this will be Keenum's Season. If he can clean up the turnovers, this Denver team could be in hunt for a playoff spot in December. #2 Kirk Cousins, Minnesota Vikings (1-2-1)  Kirk Cousins, signed a monster contract with the Minnesota Vikings this offseason. After reaching the NFC Championship game a year ago with Keenum under center, the expectations very sky high for the Vikings fans. Some even considered this a Superbowl or bust move.     If indeed it is a Superbowl or bust move, the Vikings are off to a terrible start. They opened the season with a W against the 49ers but tied it up in week 2 with the Packers thanks to some head-scratching roughing the passer penalties. But the real stunner cam in Week 3 when Vikings and Cousins looked almost clueless against a bad Buffalo Bills team who scored a combined 23 points in the remaining three games. Cousins was shutout for three quarters, he had a couple of strip sacks an INT and it was late in the 4Q that he tossed a TD almost in garbage time. Apart from that one week, Cousins was his usual self he completed nearly 70% of his passes, tossing 10 Touchdowns and just 2 picks. He has 1,387 yards in just 4 games and yet the record is 1-2-1 record.         Cousins tenure so far remained same like his Redskins tenure where he played very well when was not pressured too much. But, when pressured his performance goes down. In 2018 so far his rating when the pocket is clean was 112.2, but when he is pressured it dramatically drops down to 89.8. Cousins even brought his fumbling issue from Redskins to Vikings, in which he is second most to fumble the ball since 2015. The Vikings O-line performance has been masked by Keenum's athleticism last season of avoiding the sacks, which Cousins clearly lacks. If Vikings need to find success with Cousins under center they need to provide a clean pocket and give him time to make the plays that Keenum couldn't have done last season. The NFC North looks very interesting with Chicago Bears on Top with Packer right next to them. If the Vikings need to be in the Playoffs in a very tough NFC they need to keep teh pocket clean for Cousins.     #1 Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs (4-0)  Patrick Mahomes is not a new player that was signed or added this offseason but he is the new starter for the Kansas City Chiefs after they traded Alex Smith to the Redskins. Mahomes did start in week 17 of last season but still, this is the first season as a full-fledged starter and thought he should be in this conversation. After the kind of start he had, he certainly should be.     Mahomes had one of the best starts since the Peyton Manning's record-breaking 2013 season. Mahomes even broke the Manning's record of 12 total touchdowns by tossing 13 through weeks 1-3. During the first three weeks, Mahomes was off to fast starts putting up 20+ points to start the game and make the opposing offenses play catchup to the Chiefs. The real test for Mahomes came in week 4 against a very good Broncos defense in a very rowdy Denver environment in Monday Night Prime-time slot. He had a slow start where Denver's defense had his number during the first three quarters. But he remained calm and made some timely passes in the fourth quarter resulting in one of the most thrilling matches in 2018 season so far.         The most amazing fact about Mahomes' performance so far in 2018 is that he has yet to throw an interception. In his four starts this season he has 15 touchdowns and zero picks. This INT-less streak should be attributed to his redshirt year in 2017 under Alex Smith. There is no better player to learn from how to remain interception-free. Mahomes performance so far is a reminiscence of Deshaun Watson's performance for Houston Texans last season. Mahomes is bound to be regressed in coming weeks, which could happen very well in week 5 against a very strong Jaguars defense, who allowed only a total of 4 touchdowns. The sky is the limit for Mahomes and this Kansas City offense. All they could ask for is the defense to play some average level play who currently are last in passing yards allowed. If the defense is not improved, a very good offensive season could very well be ruined come January. Mahomes, distanced himself from others atop of the MVP race, not a bad way to kickoff your first full season as a starting NFL QB. Let's hope the football gods spare Mahomes that bit the likes of Wentz and Watson last season during their own MVP campaigns.

At this point I want to take a look at the five rookie signal-callers, who were drafted in the first round and all played between four and twelve games.  To make this clear, I didn’t want to rank the quarterbacks against each other because I think it’s still too early for that, but we can see what they have shown so far and talk about them. So I listed them purely based on where they were drafted at.        While all of them have shown promise and won some big games, the guy at the very top has truly stood out.            #1 Baker Mayfield While I thought the Browns reached for some players in the draft, I had no problem with the selection of Baker Mayfield at the top. I had Darnold as my number one quarterback, but Mayfield was in that group of three that I thought were all worth top five or six picks. He was kept on the sidelines for the first two-and-a-half weeks of the 2018 season, but when Tyrod Taylor had to go into the locker room in that Thursday night game versus the Jets, Baker came onto the field and hasn’t given up his job ever since. Not only has he given the Dawg Pound a ton of energy, he has also clearly been the top rookie quarterback and with all those outstanding rookies at all the other positions, he is right up there with the very best of that class. The numbers bear it out.     Mayfield has by far the highest completion percentage (64.4%) and yards per attempt (7.7) among all rookie signal-callers. I liked his arm and I thought he was a much better athlete than people gave him credit for, but he exceeded even my expectations. Baker throws a much tighter spiral and has a way stronger arm than you’d expect from a six-foot Big XII quarterback. He gets the ball out with anticipation, zip and pin-point accuracy. When you watch Baker’s first live-action versus the Jets and you compare it with what Tyrod Taylor did in the first half of that contest, you see the differences between a guy like him and a solid starter in Taylor. The Jets blitzed over and over again and forced Taylor to defeat tight man-coverage with his arm and getting the ball out hot, but instead he tried to run around and make things happen off script, which didn’t only end in him taking big hits but ultimately knocked him out of the game as well.     When Baker entered everything changed. He destroyed Gang Green’s blitzes by getting rid of the ball quickly and showing pocket awareness to maneuver around before dropping absolute dimes to his playmakers, who he showed trust in to win their matchups. The first overall pick has showcased clean footwork, outstanding mobility inside the pocket and tremendous command of the entire offense, making checks in no-huddle situations and deciphering opposing defenses. However, he doesn’t just have the mental aspects and fundamentals down before letting the ball go, he has made some throws that force even his biggest critics to raise their eyebrows. He has defeated tight man-coverage with Drew Brees-ish pin-point accuracy and he has delivered has some absolute ropes into tight windows. Probably his best game came versus the Panthers last Sunday. He launches several unbelievable downfield passes with a defender in almost perfect position, but with the placement of the ball those throws were basically indefensible.     Mayfield has clearly displayed the ability to diagnose a multitude of defensive looks and counter them with the understanding of where the ball needs to go, but at the same time you can not just get into the face of his pass-catchers and force him to throw those guys open – because he will do just that. Mayfield had by far his two worst games versus the Chargers and Texans – two teams that clearly were better from top to bottom on those days and overall as well. If you take those two performances out of the equation, he has thrown 17 touchdowns compared to just five interceptions. Obviously you have to take everything into consideration, but versus the Chargers those picks came on two great plays by Desmond King undercutting routes and all three at Houston happened because he tried to fit in some passes. So it’s not like he just misdiagnoses coverages or gets rattled by the opposition. Mayfield is just a gunslinger, who has trust in his arm and his receivers.     I have no problem with that, because he will still learn which chances he should and should not take. For every throw he attempts that simply isn’t there, there will be five others were you would think the same but somehow they get completed. Most importantly he takes care of the ball when he has his offense in scoring range, displayed by his QB rating of 115.1 in the opponents’ red-zone. Since Hue Jackson and Todd Haley were fired following a week eight loss to the Steelers, Baker has completed 73.2 percent of his passes for 11 touchdowns and four picks (with three of them occurring in that Texans game), plus the Browns have won three of their five games – which are as many wins as they had under Hue in 40 games. New offensive coordinator Freddy Kitchens has really helped out his rookie signal-caller by implementing elements of his college offense and doing an outstanding job protecting him, making him the least-pressured quarterback in the league these last few weeks.     If you made the Browns choose all over again who they would select with that number one overall pick, John Dorsey would run up to the commissioner with that card himself. Baker Mayfield brings an energy and sense of confidence this franchise hasn’t had since they were re-established almost 20 years ago. He is a perfect fit for the city of Cleveland and this fanbase deserved to finally get a guy like that. #2 Sam Darnold Darnold was really careless in particular in his meetings with the Dolphins, turning the ball over six total times For the second quarterback drafted in April it has been much more of an up-and-down season.     Right now he leads the league with 15 interceptions despite missing three games and he has thrown just 12 touchdowns compared to that. He has also completed 60 percent or more of his passes in just four of his ten starts and he has three games in the 30s in terms of quarterback rating. However, he also gave the entire Jets fan base hope with an incredible performance in the season-opening destruction of Detroit, led them to big wins over AFC playoff contenders in the Broncos and Colts while putting up 34 and 42 points respectively and he just rallied them to a win over the Bills, in a game they probably should have lost. Even his first play in a regular season game was very shaky, as he started off his career with a pick-six throwing across the field. This already showed you that he will take chances and he has tried to fit throws into tight windows on plenty of occasions.     Yet, he has also displayed that he is mentally strong enough to shake those things off and go after it the very next snap. After three straight losses in which he threw two TDs compared to four picks, the Jets put together their only consecutive wins. They followed that up with another trio of losses, in which Darnold really looked bad at times. Overall he has two games with two INTs, one with three and another one with four. I watched almost all his tapes and there were some dark moments, but you also see what I liked about him coming out of USC and he is as tough as a five-dollar steak. Darnold was really careless in particular in his meetings with the Dolphins, turning the ball over six total times. He got fooled by a defender in underneath coverage drifting one way and then coming back for the pick and once stared down his receiver on an out-breaking route, allowing the linebacker to drop all the way underneath it.     However, in week two he almost led his team back to a victory and his second interception was more on the receiver running a weak route in the end-zone and allowing the DB to beat him to the spot plus his receiving crew dropped four passes, while in week nine he had to deal with horrendous snaps for about half the game and threw his final two interceptions on fourth-and-very long, although another two were flat-out dropped by defenders. Still, even in those games you saw clutch throws on third down and good accuracy on the move. That has been the theme for large stretches of his rookie campaign – turnovers and risky throws happening due to a lack of help from his pass-catchers. Even versus the Vikings, when he threw three interceptions, one of those throws was a wobbler because his left tackle getting pushed into him during the release and one came off the hands of his receivers on a perfectly placed slant route.     During Darnold’s three-game absence you could see how bad this roster still is. They lost all three games with Josh McCown at the helm, including a 41-10 embarrassment against the Bills, who were without their starting rookie QB as well. Darnold played far from a perfect game last Sunday at Buffalo, but he willed that team to victory. He got banged up early, went two of seven on third downs through about the first 40 minutes and made a really stupid decision on his interception, just tossing it up there scrambling all the way to the sideline and expecting a receiver to come up with it after turning his out-route upfield. But he also delivered some absolutely perfect balls right in stride on corner, deep out and fade routes that kept his team alive and made the play of the game on third-and-goal when he was flushed right and reversed all the way across the field before finding Robby Anderson in the end-zone.     He completed another big one on a go-route to Anderson, where he freezed the middle safety for a second and then dropped it right into the bucket of his receivers versus the Bills’ top corner Tre’Davious White, which set up the game-winning touchdown. The third overall pick has definitely had his struggles as a rookie, but a lot of that had to do with the team around him. Darnold has no true, dependable playmakers around him outside of Anderson and to a lesser degree Quincy Enunwa and his offensive line has been suspect at times. I loved what I saw from him in the preseason, diagnosing defenses pre-snap and then not panicking when they tried to confuse him, but rather moving on to his next read and delivering strikes. I am also encouraged by just four fumbles on the year, because I thought his biggest concern in college was the lack of ball-security while moving around.     Say what you want, but I still believe in this kid being the Jets’ savior, because I think he has the perseverance to recover from bad plays as well as one bad season, and let’s not forget he only turned 21 a week after he was drafted. He can make those standard plays that keep offenses on schedule, but he can also create when nothing is there and deliver accurately outside the pocket. They need to load up with pieces around him to help their future out. #3 Josh Allen Enter caption     I had Allen as my number five quarterback and it was not as much due to the inconsistent accuracy that draft experts worried about, but rather because of poor pocket presence. I can make a quarterback throw every route and read every concept a million times at practice, but having a feel for when and how to move inside the pocket while maintaining a throwing posture and keeping your eyes downfield is much harder to teach, because it is somewhat of an innate ability. Far too often I saw Allen scramble and make bad decisions instead of maximizing the space he had in the pocket to make throws down the field or worst case go down and live for another play. The advantage he had over all those other guys I had ranked ahead of him was the fact that he had experience in a pro-style offense and his rare physical traits were off the charts. So far I think those are what really have stood out, while his mental game is starting to come along.     When I started watching Allen’s tape at Wyoming I saw a young Roethlisberger body-wise, but through his first nine games he has looked more like Cam Newton as a runner. He is now up to 490 yards and five TDs on the ground, with 401 of those coming off scrambles.  I remember a week three game versus the Vikings where the Bills pulled off the upset in a beatdown at Minnesota behind a ferocious defense and a Josh Allen killing the Vikes taking off multiple times.  Anthony Barr seemed to be Allen’s personal target, because he outran, trucked and even hurdled the 6’5” linebacker on separate plays.  Then in week 13 it was the Dolphins linebacker Kiko Alonso, who he once spun around like a ballerina and then beat to the edge on another scramble after he made a D-tackle completely whiff on like a dead-leg back juke.  I knew he was a tremendous athlete, but this guy is on another level. There’s only so many guys with the speed to run past linebackers one play and then have the size to run over them the very next.     In one of the crazier statistics I’ve ever seen, Allen just broke Michael Vick’s record of rushing yards in a three-game span with 335. When you run like that fumbles occur, but only two times he has put the ball on the turf and saw the defense recover.  Through nine starts Allen is 26th among all players in the league with 29 runs resulting in first downs despite just 66 carries. Only Mitch Trubisky has turned a higher percentage of his runs into first downs among player with over 50 attempts, as 43.9 percent of Allen’s rushes have resulted in fresh sets of downs.  He has produced 19 runs of 10+ yards and has made it past the marker ten of his 17 rush attempts on third down (58.8 percent). All of that while missing four games with a banged up shoulder.  The Bills are a top ten rushing offense, but without their QB’s production only three teams would rank below them in total yards and they would be dead-last in yards per carry. You would like to see him take a few less shots, but he is one of the very few who has the frame to sustain that, plus he is starting to slide more.     In addition to what he does on the ground, he has a howitzer of an arm and he is starting to make some big plays with it.  Allen’s overall numbers are definitely not where you’d like them to be, as he is completing just 52.4 percent of his passes with five touchdowns compared to nine interceptions and a QB rating of 62.8, but a lot of that has to do with the situations he is put in. I already mentioned their poor rushing numbers if their QB doesn’t run it himself, as all other ball-carrier average 3.63 yards per carry – less than half of what he does – but the Bills also simply don’t have the playmakers to make things happen with the ball in their hands.  They are second-to-last ahead of only the Cardinals in yards after catch with a little over 1000 and even though I didn’t track the numbers, I can tell you that there are very few if any teams that have faced third & 10+ more often than Buffalo.     When watching the Bills rookie QB on tape the one thing that jumps out to you is his arm strength. I think Patrick Mahomes and Allen are about in the same ball park – and I’m not sure if anybody else parks there.  He can be late on some throws and still get them to his targets before the defender has a chance to make a play on it because he just puts lasers out there, while also threatening any defense to go over the top.  His accuracy might not be ideal all the time, especially on easy dumpoffs and other underneath completions, but he is clearly precise enough to shred defenses. Even though he has put up crazy numbers on the ground since returning from injury, I have been very intrigued with some of the throws he has made during that stretch.  Versus the Dolphins in week 13 he launched two stupendous rockets to Zay Jones – one running to his right and hitting hum at the end-line for a touchdown and then another one out of his own end-zone scrambling left and hitting Jones at the sideline on third and 12 for an extra ten off the wrong foot.      Last week against the Jets he was backed up inside his own ten and didn’t let the safety bait him into a risky throw on a go-route against a muddy coverage look, but instead stayed patient and drilled a shallow post that the receiver sat down over the middle, plus later he connected on a beautiful back-shoulder pass with a slot receiver running an inside fade route versus cover-one. While he made a stupid decision scrambling to his right and just throwing up a prayer while getting hit out of bounds – which was intercepted – I came away really impressed by the rookie.  On their go-ahead drive he almost put them ahead by a touchdown on a perfect pass to his receiver running a corner route towards the pylon on a designed rollout, before settling for three, which didn’t prove to be enough.  I don’t think anybody in this class nearly has the upside Allen presents. He can kill defenses as a scrambler against man-coverages and when he gets confused by coverage looks, he can throw off either leg and fading away better than a lot of guys can from a clean pocket and he is starting to make big-time throws from the pocket.      Obviously I’d like him to maintain a normal throwing posture more instead of moving East and West, but I take it for now. The Bills O-line has been sub-par, allowing Allen to be sacked on 10.3 percent of his dropbacks.  The only player on that offense to make anything happen with the ball in his hands recently has been Isaiah McKenzie and he only just started the first game of his career.  Not only are the Bills 3-6 with Allen as their starter, as crazy as it sounds when you look at his passing numbers, adding his rushing, Allen actually owns the highest QBR among all rookie quarterbacks so far. #4 Josh Rosen Rosen actually delivered some bullets to move the offence just outside field goal range     By far the most frustration for any offense and their rookie quarterback has taken place in Arizona. The Cardinals brought in career journeymen Sam Bradford and Mike Glennon in March before even having any idea about what could happen in the draft.  Sitting at number 10 overall with the Browns, Giants, Jets, Broncos and Bills all ahead of them and little draft capital to move up, there was a good chance that this team could have ended up with none of the four favorite quarterbacks.  However, with the Giants deciding to stick with Eli Manning for another year and the Broncos going with edge rusher over signal-caller after having signed Case Keenum to a deal, Arizona didn’t have to do anything but sit there and have UCLA star-quarterback Josh Rosen fall right into their lap.  However, they decided to start the season off with Bradford and that lasted less than three full games before they trotted their rookie out there.     In a very peculiar spot, down 16-14 with about four minutes left against the league’s number one defense in the Bears, Rosen saw his first regular season action and was immediately asked to lead them to a victory from behind.  Rosen actually delivered some bullets to move the offence just outside field goal range, but was intercepted on a good fourth down attempt. The week after that he was named the starter and he hasn’t left the lineup ever since.  In his first start ever against the Seahawks I saw some impressive stuff from the rook, delivering supremely accurate passes on all three levels, just threading the needle on a multitude of them, even though a bunch of them were dropped, knocked away late or ruled incomplete due to one foot not coming down in bounds.  He came up big for them on crucial situations and the only thing that held the Cardinals back from winning that game was their own coaching staff not allowing their young signal-caller to get it done late with his arm, but instead deciding to run the ball three straight times around the opposing 30-yard line and ultimately missing the go-ahead field goal, even though it was the rookie that led them down there.     The week after that Rosen got his first career win versus the 49ers and even though the numbers might not have been that good, he took good care of the ball and hooked up with rookie teammate Christian Kirk for a huge 75-yard touchdown for the game’s first score.  Over the next two games, the team took a huge bump, as they lost by ten at the Vikings and were blown out 45-10 at home by the Broncos.  Rosen threw just one touchdown and four picks during that stretch, but I thought the numbers didn’t really tell the truth. Especially against the Broncos I thought he played much better than those horrendous stats indicated.  On his first pick-six the ball was batted up in the air at the line and on the second one the wideout inexplicably just stopped running on a slant route. Outside of that third one in the fourth quarter, when he just tried to force a big play to Kirk at last, Rosen was on time and target on curls, hooks, comebacks and other timing-based routes.      Following that demolition the Cardinals finally decided to fire their Offensive Coordinator Mike McCoy. It was not just Sam Bradford early on that willingly checked the ball down to his backs over and over again without even trying to look downfield, but also McCoy’s conservative play-calling that hindered his rookie quarterback.  The run design lacked creativity in a big way, being limited to simple dive and ISO plays for the most part, there were no vertical stretches of the defense and he just could not find ways to put the ball into the hands of the few of playmakers they had in space.  Moreover, the supporting cast for the Cards might have been even worse than the Bills’. They are dead-last in yards after the catch, barely cracking the 1000-yard mark. In comparison to that – the 49ers have almost double that amount despite playing with a backup QB and limitations at the skill spots as well.      However what really stands out about McCoy’s stint in Arizona is the way he could not put his best player David Johnson in position to succeed. Before DJ missed almost all of last season, there might have been two guys I would have taken above him if you made me choose a running back.  Yet, in seven games under their ex-OC he was limited to 72 yards from scrimmage per game on an average of just 18 touches, giving him less than four yards per touch. This has also led to the lowest number in time of possession at 26:17 a game, as they have gained an average of just 4.6 first downs on the ground. While the offense has improved to some degree under Byron Leftwich, I think it is almost unfair to evaluate Rosen like the other guys, because not only the players around him on offense but also the play-calling for large stretches has been so incredibly bad.      He is ranked among the bottom five in percentage of third downs converted via the pass, but he has faced a large amount of third-and-long situations. When it was third-and-eight or more he has completed 28.9 percent of his passes.  I still love Rosen’s touch and internal confidence. He is extremely smart and not afraid to let it rip. If you look beyond the numbers and win totals, even though they won at Lambeau field two weeks ago, you see some franchise quarterback traits.  The organization just needs to surround Rosen with more playmakers and make things easier with coordinator help. #5 Lamar Jackson Early on Jackson was used as a gadget player, coming in to run zone-reads, designed quarterback keeps, throw a couple of passes or just be a decoy for opposing defences     I truly believe Lamar Jackson is the closest thing we have had seen to Michael Vick since his days with the Falcons and Eagles.  When the Ravens decided to move back up into the first round of April’s draft to select the former Heisman trophy winner with the 32nd pick, the organization made a structural and philosophical decision, but they also knew they still had Joe Flacco on their books for this season and only then they could make the call on what they will do going forward.  Early on Jackson was used as a gadget player, coming in to run zone-reads, designed quarterback keeps, throw a couple of passes or just be a decoy for opposing defenses. When it was announced that Flacco would miss the first game after their by week, the rookie stepped into the starting lineup.  Entering at a 4-5 record, Baltimore only now lost their first game with the rookie as the starter – and that came by three points to the top-seeded Chiefs following a 3-0 start to Lamar’s career.      With Flacco back to fully participating and the Ravens deciding to go with Jackson against Tampa Bay this weekend, a new era has officially started in Charm City. The biggest difference with Jackson in the starting lineup has been the improvement of the rushing attack. I crunched the numbers and the team’s difference between their attempts, yards and averages are astonishing.  Through the first nine weeks with Flacco under center, the Ravens on average ran the ball 27 times a game for 103.8 yards, giving them an average of 3.85 yards per carry.  These last four games with the rookie taking over however, they are running the ball 46 times for 228.5 yards and 4.97 yards per carry.  That comparison is just absolutely ridiculous, giving Baltimore the league’s best marks in totals and attempts, while being right up there with the elite in average yards as well despite that run-pass ratio.  Obviously a lot of that has to do with the rookie quarterback amassing 475 total yards on the ground himself on 5.0 yards a clip and surpassing 70 yards in every game as a starter, but this goes beyond his numbers alternating their overall production.     The threat of Jackson pulling the ball on zone-reads or simply booting the other way off handoffs is so frightening for defenses that it hurts their backside help on running plays on many occasions.  Not only do they obviously have to keep the last man at the line of scrimmage leverage outside the quarterback to force him to hand the ball off, a lot of times that backside linebacker can not flow with the play whatsoever and this allows even easier cutback opportunities for the Ravens’ backs compared to if that guy just overran the play.  Fellow rookie running back Gus Edwards only entered the scene once Jackson took over and while I don’t want to take any credit away from him, his 95.5 rushing yards a game and five yards per attempt and Kenneth Dixon’s six yards per rush these last two weeks have a lot to do with who is running the play-fakes.      As far as straight-line speed goes I don’t think anybody is up to par with Jackson and he just seems to freeze defenders when he takes off. Obviously he will need to protect his body better going forward, but he will learn that. People who think Jackson just wants to scramble haven’t watched the tape, because 418 of his 475 yards have come on designed runs. He is looking to throw the ball and sometimes you feel like he almost should take off with his athletic ability.  The overall passing numbers are pedestrian at 25 attempts for 150 yards per game and four touchdowns compared to three interceptions.  Outside of a big run-and-catch play to fellow rookie tight-end Mark Andrews, Jackson hasn’t really provided the element of the deep passing attack, but he has done enough through the air to keep his offense on schedule.  The rookie out of Louisville might not have the fastball some of these other guys on the list have, but he has a whippy arm and he is comfortable throwing it on the run.      Jackson has come up with big, timely completions from the pocket as well as off schedule at the end of halves and on third downs. What is very unique about him is how we can move defenders one way with how he moves and then comes back the other way to one of his pass-catchers. Jackson still has to work a lot on his ability to pick defenses apart from the pocket, as he prefers to manipulate defenders with his movement to create clear looks for himself and as of right now he has the second-lowest adjusted completion percentage among all starting quarterbacks, but he just plays winning football.  Through four games, the rookie QB is 21 of 44 converting with his arm and legs on third and fourth downs (47.7%) and when the yardage to gain is at five or under, he is 13 of 20. Obviously he went against a few below-average defenses in the Bengals, Raiders, Falcons and Chiefs, but he also came through in the clutch for his team and battled it out with MVP front-runner Patrick Mahomes at a hostile place in Arrowhead.  With him in the lineup, Baltimore can be the team that they are built to be – which means controlling the clock with their ground game, as they average 35:52 minutes in terms of time of possession, and get after it with a rested defense.

41,Colin Kaepernick,"[""Colin Kaepernick's 5 greatest performances in the NFL  News has once again hit the NFL world that Colin Kaepernick is looking to make his way back into the league. He was recently seen working out for the Las Vegas Raiders. Kaepernick is one of the most controversial figures in the NFL due to his protests during the national anthem regarding racial inequality. What often gets lost in the discussion is his performance on the field as a quarterback.  Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterColin Kaepernick, who last played football in 2016, the same year he started kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice, is scheduled to work out this week for the Las Vegas Raiders, league sources told ESPN.More on NFL Live now.386835594Colin Kaepernick, who last played football in 2016, the same year he started kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice, is scheduled to work out this week for the Las Vegas Raiders, league sources told ESPN.More on NFL Live now. https://t.co/zAuWybhILx        Drafted in the second round (36th overall) by the San Francisco 49ers, the quarterback had back-to-back 3000 yard passing seasons in 2013 and 2014 and led the 49ers to a Superbowl appearance in 2013. He was a dual threat quarterback who in many ways helped pave the way for the modern quarterback today.           Here are Colin Kaepernick's 5 best performances as an NFL quarterback.  #5 - NFC Divisional Playoffs, 2012, vs. Green Bay Packers Green Bay Packers v San Francisco 49ers Kaepernick always seemed to have Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers number. In this NFL playoff game, Kaepernick went 26-39 for 263 yards passing and two touchdowns as well as 181 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. The Packers had no answer for him on this day and it wouldn't be the last time the quarterback would break the hearts of Packers fans.      #4 - Week 1, 2013, vs. Green Bay Packers Green Bay Packers v San Francisco 49ers Starting off the season on the right foot is a bonus for every NFL team. For the two powerhouses contending in the NFC this week, one matchup was even more important. Last season's playoff defeat was still raw and revenge was on the cards for the Packers. Unfortunately for them, the 49ers quarterback kicked off his season in a dynamic way, throwing for 412 yards, the only 400 yard passing game of his career, throwing for three touchdowns in another victory over Green Bay.      #3 - 2013 NFC Wild Card Game, vs Green Bay Packers Green Bay Packers v San Francisco 49ers We swear this isn't a Kaepernick vs. Green Bay Packers list. Sometimes some players just rise up when the occasion calls, and Kaepernick always seems to raise his game against some of the NFL's best quarterbacks. The performance wasn't overwhelming stats-wise (227 yards passing, 98 rushing), but the result was one San Francisco fans will remember. Leading his team to victory, the quarterback drove down the field, resulting in a game-winning field goal with no time left on the clock.      #2 - NFC Championship Game, 2012 vs. Atlanta Falcons San Francisco 49ers v Atlanta Falcons The quarterback led the 49ers back to the Superbowl for the first time since the Steve Young era, winning 28-24 against the favored Atlanta Falcons. Down 17-0 early in the 2nd quarter, Kaepernick would not give up, throwing for 237 yards and a touchdown. Again, it wasn't a statistically noteworthy game for him, but his never-give-up attitude and leadership capabilties were on display for all of the NFL to see, particularly in such an important game.      #1 - Week 15, 2012 vs. New England Patriots New England Patriots v San Francisco 49ers Any time you get the chance to play against the best NFL quarterback of all time and beat him, it's a memorable game. Kaepernick threw four touchdown passes, going head-to-head with Tom Brady in a late-season game that set the tone for both the playoffs and the 49ers' eventual run to the Superbowl.

"", ""Rihanna turned down Super Bowl Halftime Show opportunity to support Colin Kaepernick's protest  On Sunday, the NFL announced that Rihanna would headline this season's Super Bowl half-time show at the State Farm Stadium. The 34-year-old Grammy winner is the latest in a long line of A-list artists to be chosen for the NFL's showpiece event.  But what is rather interesting now that the news has been made public is Rihanna's interview with Vogue magazine back in 2019. In the interview, the singer was asked if she turned down the chance to perform at the 2019 Super Bowl because of her support for Colin Kaepernick, who previously took a knee to protest racial injustice and police brutality.        Rihanna said:           “Absolutely, (turning down Super Bowl performance in solidarity for Kaepernick). I couldn’t dare do that. For what? Who gains from that? Not my people. I just couldn’t be a sellout. I couldn’t be an enabler. There’s things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.” So it appears that back in 2019, the 34-year-old could not envision herself performing at the league's showpiece event due to Kaepernick's situation and what the quarterback was protesting for.

Rihanna to perform at Super Bowl half-time show in 2023 NBA All-Star Game 2015 We now know who will be the latest headliner for the NFL Super Bowl halftime show. The 34-year-old, nine-time Grammy winner will be taking center stage at State Farm Stadium in Arizona. She will be looking to replicate Eminem, Mary J. Blige, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar and 50 Cent's superb performance last year.        It was rumored that Taylor Swift could potentially be the headliner for the event, but the Saint Michael, Barbados native was chosen instead. At the time of writing, it is not known exactly who will be supporting the singer. Bad Bunny, J Balvin, Emme Muñiz, Travis Scott, Big Boi and Bruno Mars have complemented the headline act in recent years.        While it is great news for the singer to be able to perform on such a big stage, her thoughts back in 2019 make you wonder what has changed for her to now accept the invitation from the NFL.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Vogue and H/T Sportskeeda.     "", 'Rihanna addresses ‘scary responsibility’ of Super Bowl halftime show after Colin Kaepernick\'s protest  Rihanna\'s journey to the Super Bowl halftime show was more than just a simple \'yes.\'  The singer considered countless challenges before agreeing, some of which had to do with her children and her heritage. She was first invited by the NFL back in 2018, which didn\'t fall into place due to her support for Colin Kaepernick\'s protests.        Kaepernick stirred up a storm for kneeling during the national anthem before a game in 2016. Though Kaepernick is still out of the league, various celebrities and athletes have come together to support the former QB.           Back then, the ""Umbrella"" singer had declined. She saw it as not being a sellout, especially when she did not agree with things within the NFL. In a recent conversation with Vogue, Rihanna explained what changed her mind and the responsibility of raising a young black man in the US. “There’s still a lot of mending to be done in my eyes. But it’s powerful to break those doors, and have representation at such a high, high level and a consistent level.” Rihanna@rihanna🥰 @BritishVogue march 2023 issue857303107091🥰 @BritishVogue march 2023 issue https://t.co/XV79VRhvoE     After all, representing the community globally is \'powerful\' as it does send a strong message. The superstar went on to say: “Of course, raising a young black man is one of the scariest responsibilities in life. You’re like, ‘What am I leaving my kids to? This is the planet they’re gonna be living on?’ All of those things really start to hit differently.""  Rihanna\'s pregnancy was a surprise for fans (and the singer) When the Barbadian icon accepted the Super Bowl offer, she herself wasn\'t expecting to perform while pregnant. The ""Queen of Pop"" and A$AP Rocky welcomed their firstborn last may. Apple Music Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show     During the performance, Rihanna\'s baby bump was visible and highlighted by her red outfit. After the show wrapped up, a representative confirmed her pregnancy. The performance was highly anticipated, especially after a seven-year hiatus from the live stage. “It’s this knowing that you can do anything,” she explained, “even things that seem the craziest, like, ‘I’m going to say yes to the Super Bowl in the middle of postpartum?’"" But she isn\'t one to back down from a challenge. Motivated and looking forward to performing for fans again, the 34-year-old re-evaluated her initial rejection from 2018. Of course, the NFL and society have seen some substantial changes over the past few years, which played a part in her decision.With her pregnancy, the Super Bowl performance might also be Rihanna\'s final performance for some time.     ', ""Colin Kaepernick's takes aim at NFL in Netflix series  The new Netflix series, Colin In Black & White, is a drama series based on Colin Kaepernick’s life that also examines the history of racism in professional football. On the latter subject, some viewers took to Twitter to criticize a particular clip from the series.  “What they don’t want you to understand is what’s being established is a power dynamic,” Colin Kaepernick narrates. “Before they put you on the field, teams poke, prod and examine you. Searching for any defect that might affect your performance. No boundary respected. No dignity left intact.”        By drawing comparisons between the NFL and slavery, Colin Kaepernick is drawing an analogy between a modern day multi-billion dollar business and a past multi-billion dollar business that ignited the United States Civil War. The shared clip from Kaepernick’s series drew thousands of views, retweets and predictably garnered reactions from people on Twitter.

He led the 49ers to the Super Bowl in the 2012 season where they lost to the Baltimore Ravens 31-34. In 2013, he had his best statistical season, throwing 21 touchdowns against 8 interceptions and 3,197 yards passing as well as 524 yards rushing with 4 rushing touchdowns.     In the 2016 season, Colin Kaepernick first knelt during the U.S. national anthem during the 49ers' fourth and final preseason game. He wanted to show more respect to former and current U.S. military members while also drawing attention to police brutality by kneeling during the anthem. His protests drew the ire of many who saw it as disrespectful to veterans and police officers, while others recognized his efforts to bring attention to police brutality.Colin Kaepernick has not thrown an NFL pass in five years, but his influence has not waned during that time. From Nike ads to a Netflix series, Kaepernick is still making waves in the news whether or not football fans agree with his message.Also Read: What is Colin Kaepernick's Net Worth in 2021 ?     "", 'Was Colin Kaepernick better than Jalen Hurts in the Super Bowl? Bomani Jones draws QB comparison  Jalen Hurts put on a spectacular performance at Super Bowl LVII. Despite his Philadelphia Eagles being defeated by the Kansas City Chiefs, a strong case can be made that he was the best player on the field during the game. He outplayed eventual MVP Patrick Mahomes, recording 374 total yards and accounting for four touchdowns.  Bomani Jones recently made an interesting comparison during an episode of ""The Right Time."" He compared Jalen Hurts to Colin Kaepernick by talking about how dominant each of them were during their Super Bowl defeats. He also mentions what a victory could have potentially meant for the future. He said:        ""Ten years ago, Colin Kaepernick was the starting quarterback in the Super Bowl and seven yards away from it. All right, seven yards away from what you talk about, being a Super Bowl champion.            ""Now, one of the great gifts of the Kaepernick story is if they won the Super Bowl, how does that affect everything that happens subsequently? And honestly, I also look at that in the context of how would that have affected Colin Kaepernick as a football player. Like, forget about the idea of the perception, right?"" Bomani Jones also discussed his take on whether Hurts or Kaepernick is the better quarterback: ""The best of Colin Kaepernick in like 2012 and 2013 was probably better than the best Jalen Hurts. Because the ceiling was so high on that, and remember, they\'re way too wet. No AJ Brown for Kaepernick to throw the ball to when they needed a big play.""         Jones\' take on Colin Kaepernick performing better than Jalen Hurts during their Super Bowl appearances is a bit surprising. Both quarterbacks fell just short of winning their rings, as the San Francisco 49ers were defeated by the Baltimore Ravens. Kaepernick recorded 364 total yards and accounted for two touchdowns with an interception.      This means Hurts recorded more yards, doubled the number of touchdowns, and didn\'t throw an interception, while Kaepernick did. Hurts clearly put on a better statistical performance, while their team’s results were relatively the same. As for Jones\' take on Kaepernick\'s peak being better than Hurts\', this also seems inaccurate. Was Colin Kaepernick a better QB than Jalen Hurts? Super Bowl LVII While Colin Kaepernick was excellent during the peak of his NFL career, his best season didn\'t quite measure up to Jalen Hurts\' near MVP year during the 2022 NFL season. Kaepernick\'s best statistical season was in 2013, but Hurts\' 2022 campaign was better by just about every measure.        Hurts posted a 14-1 regular-season record, while accounting for 4,461 total yards and 35 touchdowns with just six interceptions. Kaepernick\'s best season included a 12-4 record, while totaling 3,721 yards and 25 touchdowns with eight interceptions. Jalen Hurts finished in second place in the 2022 NFL MVP vote, while Kaepernick failed to even receive a single vote.

Lance was essentially named the 49ers starting quarterback at the start of training camp. In his preseason debut, the quarterback proved why the team should be confident in his ability to be a starting quarterback in the NFL. Facing the Packers on Friday night, the 22-year-old played in two series and went 4/5 for 92 passing yards and seven rushing yards with a touchdown pass.           However, it was his 76-yard touchdown bomb to rookie receiver Danny Gray that really impressed fans around the league.

All eyes will continue to be on quarterback Trey Lance as he begins his first full season as the starting quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers. However, the preseason game highlighted another offensive player poised for a breakout season of his own. That player? Receiver Ray-Ray McCloud. Ray-Ray McCloud's 39-yard touchdown catch from 49ers backup quarterback Nate Sudfeld caught some attention. McCloud has spent the last two seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers, mainly on special teams as a kick and punt returner.         In 2020, the wideout was named to the second-team All-Pro roster on special teams. In 2021, he led the NFL in punt return yards. On offense last season, with injuries to the Pittsburgh wide receiving core, the Steelers used McCloud in the slot. In his extremely limited capacity, he recorded four receptions for 63 yards, averaging 15.8 yards per catch. In March of this year, McCloud signed a two-year deal with the San Francisco 49ers and it looks to benefit both parties. His speed will be an added bonus for the 49ers offense and its young quarterback.The odds are certainly stacked against him for a breakout season, having bounced around the league a couple of times already. He was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in 2018 and has since seen stints with the Panthers and Steelers, as well as a second run with the Bills.     "", ""Who is most to blame for Colin Kaepernick never making an NFL return?  The NFL preseason is in full gear, and as has been the case since 2017, Colin Kaepernick is not on a roster. That fact would blow the mind of anyone watching the player a decade ago.  Yet, in the present, there are so many factors in play that make his absence an expected one. The problem is that there are multiple sides to the discussion. Fans may fall on different sides of the aisle when it comes to why he is not playing right now.        So who is truly to blame for Kaepernick, once again, not making an NFL return?           Colin Kaepernick is not in the NFL for one clear reason San Francisco 49ers v Los Angeles Rams NFL owners are why the quarterback has been kept off a roster since the 2017 season. By now, that should be a widely accepted viewpoint given just how long it has been. That, and the fact he and the league settled a collusion case way back in 2019.        Yet there are detractors who will point to the quarterback himself as to why he has been out of the NFL for so long. First, those with such a viewpoint could say his kneeling in 2016 is why he is in his current predicament. That, however, can be seen as too harsh. Those individuals could then shift and say his play on the field led to his ouster. He went 1-11 as a starter in 2016, but did have 16 touchdowns compared to four interceptions. The San Francisco 49ers were a mess that year, leading to a regime change featuring Kyle Shanahan in charge, who decided for a fresh start at quarterback. That openness led Kaepernick to opt out of his deal and become a free agent.     The only problem with the performance argument is that Kaepernick played fine given the circumstances. Also, we see so many quarterbacks perform poorly and still have a job the next season. Even if that job is as a backup. It is fair to note that he would likely have had a job if he was playing at an MVP level in 2016. A player like Lamar Jackson or Patrick Mahomes likely could have protested in the same way, still dealt with controversy, but kept a job moving forward. Talent usually wins out in the NFL. That is no secret.        There was just a perfect storm in place that allowed NFL owners to keep Kaepernick out of the league, and it's clear no coach or front office had a strong enough argument to bring him aboard.If there was no kneeling, this would not even be a story. Yet political tension was high in 2016. The quarterback, unfortunately, became a scapegoat for a movement that was peaceful in nature, yet it brought negative attention upon the NFL. When a player does that, it never ends well for them.     "", '""Why does he keep trying out to be a slave?"" - Comedian rips Colin Kaepernick for slavery jibe  Colin Kaepernick is easily one of the most polarizing figures in professional sports history. He is back making headlines, this time because of a new Netflix series titled Colin in Black & White.  On the show, Kaepernick makes a comparison between the NFL Draft process and slavery in a controversial statement that has garnered both support and criticism. The imagery even shows shackled individuals to drive home the point.        “What they don’t want you to understand is what’s being established is a power dynamic,” said Kaepernick. “Before they put you on the field, teams poke, prod and examine you searching for any defect that might affect your performance. No boundary respect. No dignity left intact.”           One conservative comedian and media personality, Chad Prather, offered his take on Kaepernick.

Prather\'s comments seem to point toward the idea that Kaepernick made the statement at a time when he is still actively trying to return to the NFL. Conservative comedian calls out Colin Kaepernick Kaepernick\'s comments about slavery are a bit more complex and are explained more in-depth in the show. What Prather said was the most basic criticism to a larger point. Yet there is a point to be made about Kaepernick calling out the league while still hoping to make a return. At this point, he may have accepted the fact an NFL team will no longer give him a shot. He just turned 34 years old and has not played in the league since 2016. That right there is a built-in excuse for teams to avoid the quarterback. If he decides to go after the NFL it makes sense. It is also fair to see the irony in his situation of profiting off the criticism of the league. This is a unique situation and one where it is hard to see who is right at times.

He has made the transition from NFL player to activist and that may be where he can make his largest impact. Kaepernick also has endorsement deals, so he seems to be making a nice living. No matter what he says, there is a contingent of people ready to call out everything he has to say, whether it be controversial or not. Kaepernick has reached that polarizing level and that won\'t change anytime soon.     It is almost hard to believe that no NFL team gave Kaepernick a shot to play following the 2016 season.

Kaepernick became someone that NFL front offices were afraid to sign because of the potential backlash. But the passage of time - and plenty of social justice pushes (some being violent) across the country - has softened the league\'s stance on the quarterback getting another chance. Well, now that he has completed a free agent workout with the Las Vegas Raiders, the NFL world is talking realistically about which teams he could contribute for, and perhaps, even start on.        Pro Football Talk\'s Mike Florio had quite the hot take pertaining to Kaepernick starting in 2022, saying that up to five teams would benefit from replacing their current QB with Kap. ""Colin Kaepernick, with time to knock off the rust and prepare, would be better than any option the Seahawks, Panthers, and Texans currently have.

He\'d be better than any QB (sorry TuAnon) that the Dolphins currently have. He\'d possibly win the job in Atlanta, too. Can Kaepernick actually help any NFL team fare better in 2022, compared to how they will do with their incumbent starter? Colin Kaepernick would be a good fit in Seattle and Texas Florio was, potentially, going over the top in stating that the Panthers, the Falcons, and (especially) the Dolphins would be better off with Kaepernick this season. All three teams have young options under center who should get their reps this season, which isn\'t expected to bring an immediate turnaround though.     Saying that Kaepernick is a better option than Tua Tagovaiola was pure clickbait, but Carolina and Atlanta don\'t have the tools for anyone to be successful at the position, let alone an inactive QB for the past five years. With that said, the Texans and Seahawks do represent teams that have very little to offer in 2022. Either franchise would immediately generate 100x more interest with a Colin Kaepernick signing. For Seattle, Pete Carroll would be betting on Kaepernick having a higher ceiling than Geno Smith. The latter has been largely unsuccessful throughout his career but had a strong showing in three games last season.  Of course, Drew Lock looms as a backup option, but he lacks the pedigree of both. Carroll possibly knows that this is a six-win team at best, so signing Kaepernick would, at least, boost business for a franchise that, like the other 31, suffered major losses during the COVID-19 pandemic.     Houston would similarly get a boost from a financial perspective, but they also don\'t have a better QB option. Davis Mills didn\'t move the needle much at all in 2022, but for some reason has the vote of confidence from head coach Lovie Smith. Kyle Allen may actually be the better option for Houston, but if you\'re going for either of them, you have room for Colin Kaepernick.Even if Kap doesn\'t win the starting job at either destination, neither the Seahawks nor Texans have much of an excuse not to, at least, consider signing him to a \'prove-it\' deal.

For the Houston Texans, Tyrod Taylor's performance in Week 1 and an early-season win gave fans a lot of hope. However, after Taylor suffered an injury, the Texans went with rookie Davis Mills and the team has lost two straight. Daily Deshaun Watson trade rumors have also hindered the Texans.           The Buffalo Bills will now host the Houston Texans this Sunday to advance to 3-1. The Texans will avoid dropping to 1-3 and hope to get a bounce-back win.

For the Texans, it has been a struggle with a rookie quarterback under center. The Texans' defense will need to stop the Bills' offense even to have a chance.

"", ""5 NFL Players that surprised the most on Sunday - September 12th, 2021  NFL Sundays are back! Fans were treated to some incredible games and performances on the first Sunday of the new NFL season.  While the usual suspects like Patrick Mahomes and DeAndre Hopkins performed just about as well as they were expected to, there were a few players who exceeded fans' expectations and delivered masterful performances on Sunday.        Players that surprised the most on Sunday           #1 - Jameis Winston, QB, New Orleans Saints Maybe, just maybe, this was the most exciting game before the first snap. Everyone wanted to see how the New Orleans Saints would play after Drew Brees' retirement, but no one could have anticipated what happened in Louisiana for a couple of reasons. First, who could have imagined Aaron Rodgers playing so badly? Second, who could have imagined Jameis Winston playing so well? The former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback threw for five touchdowns while tallying less than 150 passing yards. It will be tough for any quarterback to surpass the craziness that was Winston's performance. A performance for the ages. #2 - Brandin Cooks, WR, Houston Texans Everyone is aware that Brandin Cooks is a player capable of producing incredible performances. The wide receiver can put up big numbers on any given Sunday.     But doing so for a team that has had such a turbulent offseason, with Tyrod Taylor under center and with a team that possibly has the worst roster in the NFL, is extremely surprising. Cooks racked up 132 receiving yards in just five catches as the Texans humbled the Jacksonville Jaguars 37-21. The wide receiver is probably the best player on the Texans' roster outside of Deshaun Watson and he did not disappoint in his team's season-opener.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Brandin Cooks (@thearcher)     #3 - Eli Mitchell, RB, San Francisco 49ers Who? Exactly! The sixth-round pick out of Louisiana is a player that no one knew, no one expected anything from. But Eli Mitchell ran for 104 yards and a touchdown on his NFL debut in a historic performance. Eli Mitchell (23 years, 133 days) is the 2nd #FTTB player since 1950 to rush for 100+ yards in his NFL debut. Mitchell rushed for 104 yards and had a TD today. The other: Ricky Watters (23-152) on Sept. 6, 1992 at Giants (100 rush yds, no TD). #SFvsDET— Darin Stephens (@SharksStats) September 12, 2021 Mitchell's incredible performance helped the San Franciso 49ers beat the Detroit Lions 41-33. #4 - Chandler Jones, LB, Arizona Cardinals Chandler Jones had five sacks on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans. Yes, that's right, five.     He tied the Cardinals' record, set last season by Hasson Reddick against the New York Giants, two shy of tying the record of seven set by former Kansas City Chiefs Derrick Thomas. Jones' performance on Sunday was so good that even LeBron James gave him a shoutout on Twitter. I’ll say it again. CHANDLER JONES is going for DPOY!!!! My GOODNESS— LeBron James (@KingJames) September 12, 2021 #5 David Njoku, TE, Cleveland BrownsOn Sunday, David Njoku caught just three passes against the Kansas City Chiefs, but managed to rack up 76 receiving yards in the Browns' loss at Arrowhead Stadium.Njoku hauled in big catches when the Browns needed them and was a big factor as a blocker as well. It was an excellent performance from the young tight end.     "", ""The new NFL season is well and truly underway, and a host of teams had perfect starts to their new campaign while others are sent back to the drawing board after poor performances.  The NFL season is back with a bang. Several matches went down to the wire, while others were decided before the last quarter started.  Kyler Murray, Jameis Winston and Patrick Mahomes had superb outings in Week 1. But Aaron Rodgers, Ryan Tannehill and Jarod Goff left a lot to be desired as their teams were taught a lesson or two on the opening weekend.        Scores from Sunday's NFL games:           Indianapolis Colts 16 - 28 Seattle Seahawks Russell Wilson an co got off to a perfect start as Wilson threw for three touchdowns, while Carson Wentz was serviceable in his first outing as a Colt.

Justin Herbert has done everything to win the NFL's Offensive Rookie of the Year Award.  Los Angeles Chargers came into the 2020 NFL Season with a different look at quarterback. Philip Rivers moved on to the Indianapolis Colts and the Chargers had to find his replacement. Tyrod Taylor would step in temporarily in Week 1 of the 2020 NFL Season.        After the Week 1 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, the Los Angeles Chargers would name Justin Herbert their starting quarterback going forward. Herbert would make his first NFL start against the defending Super Bowl Champion Kansas City Chiefs in Week 2. Once named the Chargers starting quarterback the rookie would not give it up.            Justin Herbert's 2020 NFL Rookie Season Justin Herbert would head into the Week 2 meeting with the Chiefs and put on a performance. He would complete 66.7% of his passes for 311 passing yards one touchdown and one interception.

Justin Herbert would lead the Chargers on a four game winning streak to end the 2020 NFL Season. He would defeat the Atlanta Falcons, Las Vegas Raiders, Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs to end his rookie season.

"", ""5 players unlikely to be back with the Houston Texans for the 2022 season  The Houston Texans have problems aplenty on their hands. In addition to a roster with holes in several areas and the legal issues surrounding quarterback Deshaun Watson, the team has several players who signed a one-year contract this offseason and will be free agents again in 2022.  Since the Texans will have very little cap space to work with in 2022, the team will likely lose important players.                   Five Houston Texans stars likely to be on the move.  #1 - Tyrod Taylor, QB Tyrod Taylor is just the bridge quarterback in Houston this year. He may easily win the starting spot over Davis Mills. Still, it's a classic case of a veteran quarterback who only holds the job until a younger player develops and takes over. In any case, Taylor has demonstrated on several occasions that he's not good enough to start in the NFL. It's hard to imagine a scenario in 2021 that would make it possible for him to return to the Texans next year.  #2 - Whitney Mercilus, OLB Whitney Mercilus is a critical player for the Texans, who has never received enough attention due to the presence of J.J. Watt. Mercilus was nominated for the second-team All-Pro in 2016. He has 54 sacks and 13 forced fumbles in his career.     After almost a decade with the franchise, the 32-year-old will hit the market next year as a free agent. He should sign with a team that is in optimal condition to win a ring. . Cincinnati Bengals v Houston Texans #3 - David Johnson, RB Some trades can go wrong for an NFL team. On a much higher level, we have the deal in which the Texans welcomed David Johnson from the Arizona Cardinals - or, in other words, the same trade that saw DeAndre Hopkins move to Arizona.     Texans: We wanna trade DeAndre HopkinsCards: hmm you sure?Texans: We want David Johnson and a second-rounderCards: /googles “are there two david johnsons on the cardinals”Cards: ok we gotta swap fourth-rounders thoughTexans: Deal! This won’t come back to bite us at all!— Bill Barnwell (@billbarnwell) February 7, 2021 Johnson even had good numbers in 2020, averaging 4.7 yards per carry and surpassing 1000 scrimmage yards. But Hopkins is an elite wide receiver who has continued to play at a very high level with the Cardinals, while Johnson is an expensive running back that adds little to the team's overall performance. #4 - Maliek Collins, DT Maliek Collins is a solid player who'll have a starting role in the Texans' defense in 2021. Collins is the perfect example of a signing who, no matter how well he plays this season, won't be back next year because of Houston's dire financial situation.     He has performed well in his career with the Dallas Cowboys and can be an essential rotational player for several defensive lines in the NFL. Knowing he has the skills to play for a team that may reach the playoffs, he'll not return to the Texans in 2022. #5 - Randall Cobb, WR Randall Cobb won't be a free agent in 2022, but his $10.25 million salary, with only two million in dead cap if he gets cut, makes him an easy target for the Texans to make room on the salary cap - there's no way he'll be back in Houston on that salary next year. Cobb's prime was behind him when he was one of the primary weapons in the Green Bay Packers' potent offense at the beginning of the last decade. Despite reviving his career with good performances with the Dallas Cowboys and Houston in 2020, he can no longer be seen as a great wide receiver, with his skills being average at best. Cobb will be cut next year.Would be an interesting target for the Texans. Nick Caserio was in New England when the Patriots drafted Harry, and after Brandin Cooks, the Texans' best receivers are Randall Cobb and maybe Chris Conley. Harry would get opportunities. https://t.co/Fi945Jfs80— Aaron Reiss (@aaronjreiss) July 6, 2021 Unsure about a trade offer?

Jerry Jones' boys have one more shot against the Jacksonville Jaguars next week, and that game has now become more critical.  Unlike the Cowboys, the Houston Texans are heading into their preseason finale undefeated. With everything the Texans have gone through this offseason, finishing their preseason undefeated will be a massive win. The Texans may not be a dumpster fire after all.        Here are three observations from the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans' Week 2 preseason matchup.            Houston Texans rookie QB Davis Mills has shined during the preseason #1 Houston Texans starting QB job looks to belong to Davis Mills The Houston Texans entered their offseason with a massive question mark next to their quarterback position. One thing that was for sure in Houston was that Deshaun Watson wouldn't be playing. That left the Houston Texans with Davis Mills, Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel.     All three of Davis Mills' longest completions tonight are play-action strikes. pic.twitter.com/OpTTA9LAeo— Rivers McCown (@riversmccown) August 22, 2021 Davis Mills has outperformed both Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel over the last two preseason games. Mills completed 11 of his 22 passes for 112 yards and an interception against the Packers in Week 1. He followed that above-average performance by completing ten of his sixteen passes for 115 yards against the Cowboys. It looks like Davis Mills will head into Week 1 of the regular season as the starting quarterback in Houston. That's if a miracle doesn't happen and Deshaun Watson suddenly changes his mind.      #2 Dallas Cowboys are still searching for Dak Prescott's backup The Dallas Cowboys headed into their preseason matchup with the Houston Texans with three quarterbacks battling for one job. That job is backing up their franchise quarterback Dak Prescott. Garrett Gilbert, Cooper Rush and Ben DiNucci are all fighting for the backup role. COWBOYS GAME REPLAY 🎬: Cooper Rush connects with Cedrick Wilson for the go ahead TD! ✭ #dallascowboys pic.twitter.com/Sb0K4UbAuG— The Cowboys Network (@TheCowboysNet) August 22, 2021 After the Hall of Fame Game, it looked like Garrett Gilbert would run away with the job. Cooper Rush bounced back against the Cardinals to prove he's not out of the race just yet. Ben DiNucci led the Cowboys in passing yards against the Texans, but he threw three interceptions.     With the Cowboys' preseason finale approaching quickly, Josh Rosen is starting to look even better. All three quarterbacks have had good and bad performances, making the Cowboys' backup quarterback spot an open race heading into their finale against Jacksonville.  #3 Dallas Cowboys haven't scored a rushing touchdown during the preseason The Dallas Cowboys fan base has been focused on the quarterback position and their defense. That has taken the attention away from their rushing attack. Dallas hasn't recorded a rushing touchdown in its three preseason games. Ezekiel Elliott hasn't appeared in any of the Cowboys' preseason games, but that doesn't take away their struggles. The Cowboys need their run game if they want Dak to have a successful season. With one preseason game left, the Cowboys will need their run game to find the end zone to build momentum heading into the upcoming season.Also Check Out: Complete Dallas Cowboys NFL Preseason Schedule 2021     "", ""5 NFL players who could lose their starting position in Week 6  We're heading into Week 6 of the NFL and there is competition for starting spots.  Players have put down enough tape to either lock in their starting place or have coaches starting to consider their backups. There are starters suffering injuries, rising stars pushing for a chance, and positive COVID-19 tests throwing gameplans into chaos.        One player's misfortune is another's opportunity and, from the aftermath, starting lineups will change. Here, we're looking at five players whose place may be up for grabs in Week 6.           5 players whose starting spot is under threat in Week 6 #1 – Dallas Goedert, Philadelphia Eagles Philadelphia Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert has shown progress in year four to the extent that veteran Zach Ertz has taken a back seat. But a positive COVID-19 test for Goedert seems set to leave the door open for Ertz to take the majority of snaps in the Thursday Night Football encounter against Super Bowl champions Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 6. Mike Garafolo@MikeGarafolo#Eagles TE Dallas Goedert, who is vaccinated, will need two negative tests before Thursday night to play vs. the #Buccaneers. Would seem unlikely. We’ll see.09:06 AM · Oct 12, 202152575#Eagles TE Dallas Goedert, who is vaccinated, will need two negative tests before Thursday night to play vs. the #Buccaneers. Would seem unlikely. We’ll see.     This could be Ertz's big opportunity to earn back a starting berth in the Eagles offense. The Buccaneers' defense has given up more passing yards than any other NFL team in 2021 and if Jalen Hurts and the Eagles are chasing the game, Ertz could be the main beneficiary, sending a timely reminder to head coach Nick Sirianni ahead of the trade deadline. #2 – Tyrod Taylor, Houston Texans Tyrod Taylor will not be starting in Week 6, but he could still be set to lose his starting place when the Houston Texans take on the Indianapolis Colts in an AFC South divisional clash. John McClain@McClain_on_NFLDavid Culley said when Tyrod Taylor is healthy he’ll start over Davis Mills. I’ll believe it when I see it.09:05 AM · Oct 13, 2021716David Culley said when Tyrod Taylor is healthy he’ll start over Davis Mills. I’ll believe it when I see it.     Third-round rookie selection Davis Mills showed up against the New England Patriots in Week 5, passing for 312 yards and three touchdowns. Mills was a last-minute field goal away from leading the Texans to an unlikely victory against head coach Bill Belichick, who has earned a reputation for bottling up first-year quarterbacks. Another performance of that caliber would leave a serious question for Texans head coach David Culley to answer ahead of Taylor's eventual return. The veteran is week-to-week with a hamstring injury. Mills had a solid starting debut against the Carolina Panthers in Week 3, completing 68% of his 28 pass attempts, before taking a step back with a four-interception game in a 40-0 blowout loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 4. Mills' 72% completion rate against the Pats earned him Offensive Rookie of the Week honors. Another good display against the Colts and the Texans may realize they have something in Davis, making it counter-productive to turn back to Taylor.     5 players whose starting place is in danger in Week 6 Here are three more players who could lose their starting spot in Week 6. #3 – Christian Kirk, Arizona Cardinals Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Christian Kirk had a nice start to the season through three games, culminating in a 104-yard display against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 3. But Kirk was targeted once for five yards in the Week 4 win against the Los Angeles Rams and hauled in five catches for only 39 yards against the San Francisco 49ers last week. Meanwhile, second-round rookie Rondale Moore has been making waves off the bench. Moore has increased his percentage of starting snaps in the last three weeks, recording a career-high 48% of starting snaps in Week 5. Last week, he recorded his most targets, catches and yards since Week 2. Mike Clay@MikeClayNFLRondale Moore matched Christian Kirk in routes for the first time yesterday. ARZ WR targets figure to increase slightly with Maxx Williams out, as well.08:14 AM · Oct 11, 2021925Rondale Moore matched Christian Kirk in routes for the first time yesterday. ARZ WR targets figure to increase slightly with Maxx Williams out, as well.     Kirk has done little wrong, but Moore is turning heads at every opportunity. It could take one big breakout game off the bench for Moore to overtake Kirk in the pecking order, and it could be when the unbeaten Cards face the Cleveland Browns in Week 6. #4 – Chuba Hubbard, Carolina Panthers Rookie running back Chuba Hubbard logged his first career 100-yard rushing game in Week 5, but the Carolina Panthers offense stalled against the Philadelphia Eagles and ended up falling to defeat. Without the safety blanket of checking down to Christian McCaffrey, quarterback Sam Darnold threw three interceptions against the Eagles as the Panthers blew a 15-6 half-time lead to lose 21-18 after a late blocked punt. Field Yates@FieldYatesPanthers head coach Matt Rhule says RB Christian McCaffrey is 50-50 to play on Sunday: “I couldn’t go either way right now.”12:44 PM · Oct 13, 2021113862Panthers head coach Matt Rhule says RB Christian McCaffrey is 50-50 to play on Sunday: “I couldn’t go either way right now.”     Hubbard proved he can play a role in head coach Matt Rhule's offense but, if McCaffrey is available, the temptation will be to slot the star runner back into the starting role. McCaffrey has a unique ability of ripping off a seven or eight-yard run for a first down when the heat is turned up – something the Panthers needed in the loss to the Eagles. #5 – Jacoby Brissett, Miami Dolphins, quarterback Jacoby Brissett held down the fort for three starts while Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was on the sidelines, but Week 5 could have been the final outing in the starting jersey for the former Colts and Patriots passer. Brissett sustained a hamstring injury during last week's loss against the Buccaneers but played through the pain barrier and finished the game. Tagovailoa has been officially designated to return ahead of the Dolphins' Week 6 game in London, England, and should be under center against the Jaguars having recovered from breaking ribs in Week 2.

The undefeated Carolina Panthers will travel to NRG Stadium to take on the Houston Texans on Thursday night. The Panthers look like one of the best teams in league with an incredible defense that puts pressure at an exorbitant rate. The Texans, well, they don't look as bad as everyone expected they would. Unfortunately, we may see a diminished version of this Houston team as Davis Mills will start with Tyrod Taylor on injured reserve.     Houston Texans v Cleveland Browns This game should provide us with an opportunity to observe what Tim Kelly, who's making noise with the Texans' offense, can do against a ferocious pass rush. This game would be a more exciting contest if the Texans had Tyrod Taylor available after his strong start to the season. But with rookie Davis Mills starting for the first time in his NFL career and a short week, the Panthers should win this game with some comfort.     There is not a worse opponent for Mills to start his career against. He's far from ready to play, and the Panthers began their season on fire, especially with their loaded defensive line. Not only should Carolina win, but they will also cover the spread. There's still a reason to watch this game, though. Tim Kelly is becoming a hot commodity in NFL circles for doing what he's doing with this offense, which lacks talent in most groups.

The Carolina Panthers have been the most talked-about team when it comes to landing Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson. With the recent lawsuits that have been placed against Watson, it's going to be tough to get him at the moment. Deshaun Watson has made it known that he has no problem sitting out until the Texans trade him.  Houston recently added former Los Angeles Chargers back-up quarterback Tyrod Taylor, but it's hard to believe the Texans will enter the 2021-2022 NFL season with him as their starting quarterback. Instead of the Panthers pursuing the Texans starting quarterback, Houston would be wise to pursue Teddy Bridgewater to start while Watson sits.                   NFL Trade Rumors: How does Teddy Bridgewater help the Houston Texans? Carolina Panthers QB Teddy Bridgewater could help the Houston Texans The Carolina Panthers are projected to select a quarterback with their eighth overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. They have expressed interest in moving their current starting quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. The Houston Texans need help at quarterback and this trade makes the most sense. Panthers send: Teddy Bridgewater, 8th overall, 40th overall, 2022 1st, 2022 2nd, 2023 1st, 2023 3rdTexans send: Deshaun WatsonTexans get a starting caliber QB, boatload of picks and prime position for first overall in 2022Panthers get their guy😍— Brandon Coyle / NFL Draft (@CoyleNfl) March 17, 2021     Teddy Bridgewater plays his best football when the spotlight is not on him. He struggles when the weight of a franchise is on his shoulders. When he started for the New Orleans Saints in 2019, Bridgewater went (5-0) as a starter. Back then, there was no question that Bridgewater was a temporary starter until Drew Brees returned from injury. His performance in the 2019-2020 NFL season landed him a big payday with Carolina, and Bridgewater held the weight of the Carolina Panthers franchise on his shoulders. They finished the 2020-2021 NFL season with a (4-11) record. If the Houston Texans pursue Teddy Bridgewater through a trade, they could be getting the same version of Bridgewater that played for New Orleans. The Texans have made it known that Deshaun Watson is their quarterback and that is not changing. This will take the spotlight off of Bridgewater. With the QB trade market heating up, here's where we think the top QBs end up:Deshaun Watson: #Panthers Russell Wilson: #Seahawks Carson Wentz: #Colts Sam Darnold: #WashingtonFootballDerek Carr: #Raiders Marcus Mariota: #49ers Teddy Bridgewater: #Texans Jimmy G: #Patriots— Turfside Talk (@TurfsideTalk) February 12, 2021     Teddy Bridgewater has the skill set to be a successful starting quarterback. He showed that with the Minnesota Vikings in 2015 when he finished with an (11-5) record. The Houston Texans will be getting a quarterback that will take a lot of risks. Outside of his rookie year and last season, Teddy Bridgwater doesn't turn the football over often. With all the issues surrounding Deshaun Watson, it only makes sense for the Houston Texans to find a temporary replacement. Teddy Bridgewater is the perfect temporary replacement for Watson for the 2021-2022 NFL season. Unsure about a trade offer?

Ja\'Marr Chase  Every player entered the 2021 NFL season with a certain level of expectation. They were based on several factors such as past performance and team situation. Some players have surpassed them while others have struggled to meet them. Here are five players who have exceeded expectations in the 2021 NFL season.  Exceeding expectations in the 2021 NFL season        #5 - QB Davis Mills, Houston Texans           Davis Mills was drafted by the Houston Texans as a prospect for a possible role in the future. He was never supposed to be a starter in the 2021 NFL season, but circumstances forced him into the position. Deshaun Watson is dealing with issues off the field and his replacement, Tyrod Taylor, was injured early in the 2021 NFL season. Rivers McCown@riversmccownDavid Culley on Davis Mills/QB: ""It\'s extremely important for the entire football team, you know, to know that when you go out there that particular guy is going to do his job ... I feel like, in Davis, we have a guy like that, that in the future could be that kind of guy.""12:14 PM · Oct 27, 2021151David Culley on Davis Mills/QB: ""It\'s extremely important for the entire football team, you know, to know that when you go out there that particular guy is going to do his job ... I feel like, in Davis, we have a guy like that, that in the future could be that kind of guy."" https://t.co/zQhM7BpDEf All things considered, Davis Mills has done a good job filling in as a starting quarterback sooner than expected. He has statistically held his own with five other rookie quarterbacks who were all drafted in the first round, while he was selected in the fourth.     #4 - CB Trevon Diggs, Dallas Cowboys Trevon Diggs showed great potential in his 2020 rookie season. He got better as the season progressed and recorded three interceptions over his last five games. He entered the 2021 NFL season with expectations of being a solid cornerback, but he has taken things to the next level.

He is three interceptions clear of second place. He has also scored two defensive touchdowns this season and is an early candidate for Defensive Player of the Year.     Exceeding expectations in the 2021 NFL season #3 - RB Ezekiel Elliot, Dallas Cowboys The 2021 NFL season has seen a revival of Ezekiel Elliot. He had the worst season of his career in 2020 by almost every measure. The short lifespan of running backs made many believe that his best days were long behind him and that he had become just an average player.

He ranks fifth in rushing yards, tenth in yards per carry and third in rushing touchdowns. Zeke is not done yet.     #2 - WR/RB Cordarrelle Patterson, Atlanta Falcons Cordarrelle Patterson was one of the biggest surprises of the 2021 NFL season. He has done it all for the Falcons this season, leading the team in rushing yards, rushing touchdowns and receiving touchdowns while also ranking second in receiving yards and third in receptions. He is also their primary kick returner. He is now 30 years old, and is having the best season of his career. He has been a utility player in recent seasons but hasn\'t featured in any offenses. New head coach Arthur Smith has figured out a way to utilize his skillset. #1 - WR Ja\'Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals Ja\'Marr Chase and quarterback Joe Burrow had elite chemistry when they played together in college at LSU. The Bengals drafted Chase in an attempt to recreate that. Expectations were high for Chase during the 2021 NFL season, but he has far surpassed them.

43,Cooper Rush,"['Dallas Cowboys without Dak Prescott lost to the Philadelphia Eagles.  Dak Prescott was once again unavailable to play for the Dallas Cowboys against the Philadelphia Eagles due to this thumb injury.  And, as fate would have it, backup quarterback Cooper Rush, who was on a five-game winning streak as the Cowboys\' starting quarterback, finally lost a game.        The Philadelphia Eagles won the game 26-20 in Week 6 and Rush had arguably the most dire performance of his career.           After all the hype about ""Super Rush"" from various analysts and endless debates about how he\'s seemingly an upgrade over Prescott, Cooper Rush threw three interceptions in what might have been his last start of the season.    Prior to the game, former New England Patriots receiver Randy Moss raved about Cooper Rush and argued that if he won against the Eagles, why would the Cowboys need Dak Prescott?     Here\'s what Moss said: ""If [Cooper Rush] goes and wins this game tonight ... he can handle on the road, at home, whatever. Why are we gonna look at Dak?"" Following the loss to the Eagles and a poor performance from Cooper Rush, NFL fans trolled ESPN analysts who were stating Rush is better than Prescott.

Dak Prescott expected to return in Week 7 vs Detroit Lions Dallas Cowboys v Philadelphia Eagles Dak Prescott is expected to start for the Dallas Cowboys next week when they face the Detroit Lions. Throughout the week in the buildup to face the Eagles, there was a possibility that Prescott could play, but the franchise opted to be patient, especially against an in-form Eagles team. Against the Lions, Prescott will have a great opportunity to showcase his talent and settle any possible quarterback controversy in Arlington.     Skip Bayless@RealSkipBaylessOnly one Cowboy has to be happy right now: Dak Prescott.2088176Only one Cowboy has to be happy right now: Dak Prescott. Skip Bayless@RealSkipBaylessI\'d like to say Dak Prescott would\'ve won that game. But did you see him in this year\'s opener? In last year\'s playoff game? Unfortunately, I did.54247I\'d like to say Dak Prescott would\'ve won that game. But did you see him in this year\'s opener? In last year\'s playoff game? Unfortunately, I did.Moreover, due to a poor performance by Cooper Rush against the Eagles, the pressure will now be much less on Prescott than it would have been if Rush had inspired the Cowboys to a win over the Eagles.The ball\'s now in Prescott\'s hands as he gears up for his return next week.     ', 'Skip Bayless stunned by Cooper Rush\' show for Cowboys in Dak Prescott\'s absence  Skip Bayless couldn\'t stop gushing about how well Cooper Rush is playing as Dak Prescott\'s reliever as the Dallas Cowboys quarterback. In the opening week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dak Prescott fractured his thumb and Cooper Rush has since replaced him on the Dallas Cowboys side. There were fears that when Dak Prescott was injured, the Cowboys would tank due to a backup quarterback taking his place, but Cooper Rush has been admirable ever since.  NFL on CBS 🏈@NFLonCBSLast three undrafted free agent QBs to win first 3 career starts:Cooper RushDuck HodgesTaysom Hill2297170Last three undrafted free agent QBs to win first 3 career starts:Cooper RushDuck HodgesTaysom Hill https://t.co/n0E4gbEhGH        Skip Bayless went on to say that these were the most subtle clutch performances he had ever seen from a backup quarterback over a period of three games. He said:           ""Cooper Rush has played the best three backup quarterbacks first starts. The first three start. No one in the history of this league has played better for three straight games. Even Jimmy G was pretty good. But remember, he got hurt right away in his second start. So I have to disqualify that because he couldn\'t keep on keeping on. He was obviously playing for a very good team.""  Cooper Rush\'s performances so far that got Skip Bayless raving Cooper Rush relieved Dak Prescott in the first week and scored only 64 yards in passing and no touchdowns. But it is in the games ever since that he has been very careful with the ball and not thrown a single interception. Instead, he has led them on long drives, coming up with clutch plays that have helped them win matches.     Skip Bayless@RealSkipBaylessAll I know is this: I\'m certainly not saying Cooper Rush is better than Dak Prescott ... BUT HE HAS PLAYED BETTER IN HIS THREE STARTS, TWO ON THE ROAD, THAN DAK HAS AGAINST GOOD TEAMS OVER HIS LAST 12 GAMES.3681339All I know is this: I\'m certainly not saying Cooper Rush is better than Dak Prescott ... BUT HE HAS PLAYED BETTER IN HIS THREE STARTS, TWO ON THE ROAD, THAN DAK HAS AGAINST GOOD TEAMS OVER HIS LAST 12 GAMES. He had a passer rating of 95.5 against the Cincinnati Bengals and completed 61.3% of his passes. It improved to 98.2 and 67.7% against the New York Giants, showing why Dallas Cowboys fans like Skip Bayless are excited about what they are seeing. Bayless said, highlighting one such clutch play: ""But Cooper Rush has been sensationally but suddenly off-radar clutch in all three games. He throws up with 55 seconds left, a touchdown pass to Amari Cooper to win on the road on the solo Sunday night stage at Minnesota""     As Shannon Sharpe pushed back, though, that does not mean Cooper Rush is ready to take over from Dak Prescott as the starter. While Skip Bayless seemed to leave open that possibility, he repeatedly stated that in these three games Rush has been better than Prescott the entire last season.   For long-suffering fans of the Cowboys, who saw their team agonizingly lose in the first stage of the playoffs yet again, everything new looks great for now. Who knows, maybe with Cooper Rush, they have a new franchise quarterback? But no judgment should be based on the performance of a mere three games.     ', 'Is Cooper Rush healthy and starting today?  Cooper Rush was merely sitting on the Dallas Cowboys\' bench and observing proceedings when disaster struck in week one of the 2022 NFL season. Cowboys\' starting quarterback and team icon Dak Prescott had just gone down hurt, and there was still time on the clock left in their matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. That meant one thing: Rush was going to deputize for Dak against arguably the toughest opposition he\'s ever faced.  Rush stepped onto the field and performed admirably, giving a good account of himself as he shared the Gridiron with some of the game\'s biggest players like Ezekiel Elliott, CeeDee Lamb, Mike Evans, and the GOAT quarterback himself, Tom Brady. Rush\'s performance was so good that Cowboys\' owner Jerry Jones chose not to step into the market for another quarterback, with Dak Prescott being ruled out for a few weeks.        Since that week one matchup, Cooper Rush has gone four starts undefeated, as he has led the Cowboys to one of their best games in a while and solidified his role in the locker room.

The Dallas Cowboys face their biggest test since week one, as they are up against the last unbeaten side in the NFL, the Philadelphia Eagles, led by the rampant Jalen Hurts. Cooper Rush will be tasked with steadying the ship again as he comes up against yet another stellar shot caller.     Yes, Cooper Rush is indeed healthy, and he goes into the Philadelphia game as fit as a fiddle and ready to implement the Cowboys\' game plan, just like he has when called upon over the years. It remains to be seen what style the Cowboys will adopt against the Eagles, as this game looks like it will be a typical ""Battle of the Trenches"" affair, thanks to the strength of both sides\' defenses.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Is Cooper Rush starting today?     Yes, Cooper Rush will be starting today, as Dak Prescott has not been cleared a hundred percent by the Dallas Cowboys\' medical team to partake in any real game contact. Coach Mike McCarthy on Friday confirmed what CowboysSI.com reported a day ago that Prescott was involved in some reps, adding to @1053thefan, ""The last two days, he hit the target … today will be a recovery day for him because I know he probably did a little more than we anticipated yesterday. ""We\'re on schedule. Dak is getting better."" That goes to show that the Cowboys are pretty satisfied with the performance of Rush so far, so much so that they do not see the need to rush Prescott back into action. Rush is on a 5-0 streak as a starter counting from last year, and judging by his performances over the past few weeks, he looks capable of prolonging the streak.     ✭Cowboys News✭@DemBoyz_NewsTouchdown Cooper Rush to CeeDee Lamb 32378Touchdown Cooper Rush to CeeDee Lamb 🔥https://t.co/WlMgE7piKB Cooper Rush\'s Timeline Cooper Rush has been in the league for six years, and before circumstances arose this season, he had played less than an average of one game per season. The former Central Michigan University standout went undrafted in the 2017 NFL Draft, after which the Dallas Cowboys signed him. He has been a part of America\'s team since, aside from a brief spell with the New York Giants in 2020, which yielded no competitive snaps.     Rush has been a part of 16 games in the NFL, racking up 1,263 passing yards, 7 touchdown passes, 1 intercepted pass, and a 95.9 passer rating throughout his career.

Rush is now 4-0 as the Cowboys\' starting quarterback, and he has kept the team afloat in the absence of Prescott, who suffered a thumb injury in Week 1 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.                     Following another great performance from Cooper Rush, Colin Cowherd is confident that the Cowboys have two QB1s as the gap between Dak Prescott and Cooper Rush is not that big. Here\'s what Cowherd said: ""Most people aren\'t saying Cooper Rush is Dak Prescott, but he\'s won four straight starts. Okay, right. Teddy Bridgewater. won five straight starts for the saints as a backup. Why? Because Teddy Bridgewater is an arguable starter. He\'s a low end starter or a great backup. Cooper Rush is a great backup. Or perhaps he\'s a low end starter.""     Colin Cowherd added: ""Well, most of us and most people I know in the league consider Dak Prescott, a middle of the pack starter. So Dak is better than Cooper rush. But it\'s not a huge gap."" Cowherd continued: ""If you put Dak on the field going up against Cooper rush, Dak better, a little better. And that\'s why paying him $40 million is sort of a cautionary tale on what happens when you don\'t have a quarterback that can elevate others...""

There might be other teams as well who might look to get Rush, as he has arguably played better than many quarterbacks in the league.  Dak Prescott is expected to make his much-awaited return against the Los Angeles Rams next week Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Dallas Cowboys     Barring any late setbacks, Prescott is scheduled to make his return from injury next week against the Los Angeles Rams. It is certainly not the most ideal game for him to make his return as the Rams will possess a tough challenge for the Cowboys. In his absence, the Cowboys have won all three games, and now Prescott will be making his return against the reigning Super Bowl champs.

', 'NFL analyst claims Cooper Rush lost the starting job on Sunday Night Football  Cooper Rush entered Week 6 of the 2022 NFL season as an undefeated quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. He won all of his first five starts for the team, including going a perfect 4-0 in his first four games this campaign. He has been filling in for injured starter Dak Prescott since Week 1.  All of that changed in Sunday Night Football when he was defeated by the Philadelphia Eagles. With the loss, the Cowboys fell to 4-2 this season. Max Kellerman recently discussed his opinion on what the loss means for Rush and the Cowboys\' starting quarterback situation. Here\'s what he said during an episode of Keyshawn JWill & Max:        ""Imagine if he wins that game and Dak is ready against Detroit. I\'m still going with Cooper Rush until he loses, but… it worked out perfectly for the Cowboys because they won every game. Now it\'s the perfect time to bring Dak back against Detroit. You lose to Philly. There\'s no issue, no nothing. You bring him right back.""                   Kellerman made it clear that if Rush had pulled off a victory against the Eagles in Week 6, the Cowboys could have stuck with him. That didn\'t happen, so he thinks it\'s time to move Rush back to the bench and prepare Prescott for Week 7 against the Detroit Lions. Has Cooper Rush failed in not securing the starting QB job for the Cowboys? Dallas Cowboys QB2 Cooper Rush     Cooper Rush has exceeded expectations while filling in for Dak Prescott as the starting quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. Many around the league believed the Cowboys were doomed when Prescott fractured his thumb during their Week 1 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Rush has proved the doubters wrong with his performances Not only did Cooper Rush stabilize the Cowboys, he helped them thrive. They recorded four consecutive wins prior to their loss against the Eagles in Week 6. This has kept them in contention for the NFC East division title and another trip to the playoffs.         While winning games is always the most important thing, their offense has suffered in Prescott\'s absence. The Cowboys led the entire NFL in total yards and points per game during the 2021 NFL season. However, they rank in the bottom ten in both categories this season. With the exception of being absolutely spectacular, Rush was always going to just be a fill-in quarterback until Prescott returned. It\'s unlikely he would have replaced Prescott permanently, considering the organization\'s overall commitment to their current franchise quarterback.Cooper Rush didn\'t fail by any stretch of the imagination. He\'s proven to be a reliable back-up quarterback and could possibly earn another look as a starter down the road.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Keyshawn JWill & Max and H/T Sportskeeda.     ', ""Does Cowboys backup QB Cooper Rush have what it takes to replace Dak Prescott in 2023?  Due to his difficult season, Dak Prescott's time as the Dallas Cowboys' starting quarterback may be coming to an end. He had a point to make in the playoffs that would have helped quell some playoff scrutiny, but he fell short of expectations again.  With 15 interceptions, Prescott is atop the league with Houston's Davis Mills. Prescott has passed for 166 touchdowns and 24,943 yards in his seven-year tenure. But he also has 52 fumbles and 65 interceptions.        So, you can see why owner Jerry Jones was so taken with the stand-in Cooper Rush while Prescott was injured, especially considering Prescott's 2-4 postseason record. We have seen Prescott suffer from injuries even just this season, but will Rush be able to take over entirely as the Cowboys' main quarterback?           PhillySports (J) ❄️❄️☃️⛄️🎄🎄@Philly_SportssAre we absolutely certain Dak Prescott is better than Cooper rush ?657Are we absolutely certain Dak Prescott is better than Cooper rush ? https://t.co/LyT7xpR2yH From the second to the sixth week of the regular season, Cooper Rush started at quarterback. He performed so effectively that several observers and fans were rooting for him to keep starting even after Prescott was healthy.     Rush had 956 yards, five scores, and three interceptions through those five starts. In three of the games, he completed more than 60% of his throws, and he finished with an 81.9 quarterback rating throughout that span. After handing Prescott his starting job back, the Cowboys ended the regular season with a 12-5 mark, placing them second in the NFC East. NFL@NFLThe final play that sends the @49ers to the NFC Championship! #NFLPlayoffs88311380The final play that sends the @49ers to the NFC Championship! #NFLPlayoffs https://t.co/Du5KruFQ3q Rush has participated in 19 games in his career, completing 59.0% of his throws for 1,475 yards, 8 TDs, and 4 INTs. Although he goes by the name Rush, he is not particularly adept at rushing. Rush has only carried the ball 20 times for 11 yards.     Dak Prescott has barely completed half of a four-year, $160 million contract. From a strictly financial standpoint, the Cowboys are unable to end things with Prescott because he will receive a guaranteed $31 million for the upcoming season. He likely won't be dealt, but if he fails to get a solid start in 2023, there may be good cause to believe Cooper Rush will replace him as the starter. The Cowboys and possibly other quarterback-needy franchises now have something to discuss, thanks to Rush's good performances. It remains to be seen what awaits the 29-year-old in the offseason. Cooper Rush’s timeline Cooper Rush started 49 games for Central Michigan University, accumulating 12,891 yards and 90 TDs in the air. However, he wasn't selected in the 2017 NFL draft. As a sophomore, Rush threw for an NCAA bowl record seven touchdowns and led CMU in a 49-48 loss to Western Kentucky in the 2014 Bahamas Bowl. Rush's pass on the final play led to a wild 75-yard touchdown that pulled the Chippewas, who had trailed 49-14, to within one point, but his two-point conversion pass was unsuccessful.

Cowboys face Cooper Rush - Dak Prescott dilemma Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott recently had stitches removed from his surgically repaired thumb. He suffered an injury in the opening gameweek against the Buccaneers and is still recovering. Now back to throwing a football, sources suggest that the quarterback could be eyeing a comeback for next week's tie against the Rams.     Owner Jerry Jones has suggested that Dallas could have a real quarterback competition on their hands. Despite Rush's stellar performances of late, it will be difficult for the team to sit out their franchise QB. Here's what Jones said about the situation: “If he comes in here and plays as well as Prescott played, Rush played that well over these next games, I’d walk to New York to get that. Do I think that it’s possible for Rush to come in here and play at a level to win games the way Prescott did when he took over for Romo? Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

The Cowboys were held to just three points and were the only team in Week 1 not to score a touchdown.  Prescott looked like a quarterback who had not played any proper football for months, and it showed as he completed 14 of his 29 passes for 134 yards and an interception. Bayless was not happy with what he saw from the Cowboys signal-caller and slammed him for his performance on Undisputed.        “Did I overestimate the fourth-round pick? Who plays occasionally like he’s the fourth-overall pick, but too often he plays like a fourth-round pick. The other night, he played like a seventh-round pick to me.""              “Dak stunk it up and its why I can’t get all bent out of shape for losing Dak Prescott. I have been up and down on him since he was drafted in the fourth-round.”     After Prescott\'s injury that will see him sidelined for at least four weeks, back-up Cooper Rush will be tasked with keeping the Cowboys\' season alive until No. 4 returns.  Dak Prescott struggles in Cowboys\' season opener Dak Prescott (under helmet) during the Cowboys\' season-opening game It was hard on the eyes and even harder for Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night. The Tampa Bay defense, led by Todd Bowles, made life very difficult for the Cowboys offense.        The game started brightly for Dallas as they drove down the field and scored what would be their only points of the game. After that, it was tough sledding for Dallas as their receivers simply could not get open. Prescott often forced the ball into tight coverage and was lucky not to be picked off more than once. The Buccaneers held Dallas to 3/15 on third down as the offense could not move the ball at all and kept the home side to 2/5 on fourth down. They also kept the Cowboys offense to just 3.8 yards per play.

Bayless is a fan of Cooper Rush Washington Commanders v Dallas Cowboys     Bayless has been Rush\'s biggest fan, much in the same way he was Prescott\'s when he burst onto the scene in 2016. Rush\'s tape speaks for itself, according to Bayless. Speaking on Undisputed earlier last week and said that if you put up Dak Prescott\'s tape from last year and Rush\'s this year, there isn\'t much difference at all. In fact, he says people would think Rush is better than Prescott based on the tape. Bayless said: ""I showed you Dak\'s tape going back to the game after the opening night game on Thursday night at Tom Brady, all the rest of the games last year, the playoff game last year, the opening night game this year against Tampa.""        ""If I showed you all that tape versus the three games, the tape on Cooper Rush, you\'d say this guy\'s way better than that guy. That\'s what you would say."" While Bayless\' comments are valid, there is still no denying that the Cowboys have a better chance at winning football games with Dak Prescott under center.

Jones was rather efficient in the win, completing 23 of his 27 passes for 246 yards. The running game was solid enough with Damien Harris (8 carries, 65 yards) as the standout on the day.

After he went viral saying there aren\'t 32 quarterbacks better than him on Monday, Newton went to work at the pro day, and NFL fans came away from his workout with one thing stuck in their minds: He can still throw the football.        While it is fine throwing against air, when the time comes to play against other defenders, that is where the real test is for the 33-year-old.

It remains to be seen whether the veteran quarterback will get another chance in the NFL, but he is putting his best foot forward in an attempt to get back into the league.  Could Cam Newton sign with a team in 2023? Carolina Panthers QB Cam Newton Given that Cam Newton hasn\'t played an NFL snap since 2021, teams could be hesitant to give the veteran a roster spot. Not seen as a backup quarterback in the NFL due to his charisma and energy, would a team be comfortable with having Newton as a backup?        The other point is, what would the contract offer look like? At first glance, it would likely have to be a veteran\'s minimum contract, and it\'s unclear if Cam Newton would be willing to accept that kind of deal.        The fire still burns to return to the NFL, but his record since 2019 doesn\'t make for good reading. Newton is 7-16 as a starter, which doesn\'t bode well for his chances.Will there be a market for Newton? We await with anticipation.

He initially suffered a bone bruise in 2021 while in Alabama, but it did not lead to any missed snaps. In the second case, he injured both ankles and was forced to miss the game altogether. Last year, he did not have any injury problems behind a steady offensive line and started all 17 regular season games. The extent of the injury, as highlighted before, is not known, but there is a good chance that he may miss 2-4 weeks, including the New England Patriots' next game against the Green Bay Packers. In such circumstances, they would have to rely on either Brian Hoyer or rookie Bailey Zappe.    Losing Mac Jones would be a huge blow to Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots. Even though it is early in the season, they have begun it 1-2 after their latest loss and sit fourth in the AFC East. The offense was already stuttering as they scored only 17 points in their solitary win against the equally uninspiring Pittsburgh Steelers, but if Jones were to miss a major chunk of the season, it would only go uphill from here.

Manning recently studied film on New England Patriots rookie quarterback Mac Jones. Jones and the Patriots are currently 7-4 tied with the Buffalo Bills at the top of the AFC East. Manning looked at film from the Patriots\' dominant win over the Cleveland Browns in Week 10.     Manning saw how Jones was able to get a touchdown pass to Kendrick Bourne, and while it looked quite impressive, he said that there were things that Jones could have done better. He stated that Jones needed to control the Browns defense with his eyes better, something that you hear a lot of quarterbacks trying to do. ""He should\'ve been looking to the right knowing he\'s gonna throw this seam route the whole time"" Peyton Manning then showed where Mac Jones saw the Browns show a blitz, and he immediately called an audible. Right before the ball was snapped, Jones realized that the Browns weren\'t going to blitz. He then changed the play back to what was originally called. Manning showed a lot of praise for the rookie for having the acumen to understand what the opposing defense was doing. The Patriots were able to pick up a big gain on the play.     New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick obviously saw Mac Jones\' ability to be in a pro-style offense when he was at Alabama, which led them to not only drafting him in the first round but also starting him Week 1.The Patriots had another dominant win over the Atlanta Falcons last Thursday night to extend their win streak to five games. The Patriots are now gearing up to host the Tennessee Titans this Thursday night.Also Read: Who are Peyton Manning\'s kids?     ', 'Is Bill Belichick sticking with Mac Jones? Patriots’ Super Bowl-winning safety gives inside details  Mac Jones started off his career in the NFL pretty well but things went downhill in his second season. Because of this, rumors began circulating around the world about the franchise not seeing him as their future quarterback.  Jones\' performance in his sophomore season was hampered by the departure of Josh McDaniels to the Las Vegas Raiders. He was never able to fit well with Joe Judge and Matt Patricia.        Patriots veteran safety Devin McCourty recently spoke publicly of Jones\' situation with the Patriots and gave clarity about it.              Here\'s what David McCourty said on Good Morning Football: ""They know the future is Matt Jones and I\'m excited for this guy this year. Because now you get Billy O\'Brien coming in as offensive coordinator, great success has done well everywhere he\'s been offensively, he gets to come in now and work with Mac, and he\'s gonna have stability around him.     ""I think the team is gonna go get another guy to be a receiver in that office. Hopefully bring my guy Jacoby Meyers back, and be a part of it... ""He\'s a captain in that locker room and only a second-year and really kind of was a captain the year before as a rookie leading those guys. So I\'m excited for Mac, I think sky\'s the limit."" The appointment of Bill O\'Brien as the new offensive coordinator for the New England Patriots is certainly going to help Jones, as he has played under O\'Brien at Alabama. McCourt\'s words proved that the Patriots players still respect Jones and see him as their long-term quarterback. This will further boost Jones\' confidence and hopefully, he will bounce back next season.

', ""Does Bill Belichick trust Mac Jones more than Tom Brady?  Bill Belichick had the final say with Tom Brady and he has the final say with Mac Jones. If he wanted to effectively keep one of the quarterbacks out of the game plan, he could do it with a snap of his fingers.   So, after Mac Jones' three-pass performance on Monday Night Football, it's fair to ask how much he trusts Mac Jones in his rookie season.        How much does this compare to how he used Brady back in his first season as a starter?           Jones vs Brady: Who has/had more trust with Belichick? Tennessee Titans v New England Patriots Tom Brady's case Tom Brady never had a game in which he threw three passes. The game that saw him throw the least passes in his first season was in his first game in which he completed five of ten passes in a 3-10 loss to the New York Jets.      In a Week 14 game against the Buffalo Bills that same year, Brady threw 35 times. Of course, the circumstances with the weather and playoff positioning were different.  The stakes weren't as high.

But if one compares both quarterbacks' first seasons in the NFL, it is a very different story. Mac Jones' case Tom Brady didn't play in his first season with Belichick. As such, it was a clear indication that Brady wasn't yet trusted to step on the field.      Meanwhile, Mac Jones is already 13 games into his NFL career. Bill Belichick cut ties with Cam Newton to give Jones more playing time. Zack Cox@ZackCoxNESNMac Jones is bundled up tonight.

Full hood underneath his helmet. https://t.co/lS9AA4snrH Based on this alone, one could say that Mac Jones is much more trusted than Tom Brady was at the same point in their careers. Additionally, based on what Bill Belichick said after the Bills game in which Jones threw three times, it is clear that the weather was the leading factor behind the decision.      According to Patriots Wire, had they had to throw, they would have. “Again, I think if it had been a different type of game and we would have needed to throw there in the fourth quarter then we would have thrown,” he said. “We were able to manage the game the way we did and that worked out all right for us.” Who has more trust? Mac Jones clearly earned more trust with Bill Belichick than Brady did in 2000. Brady threw three times in his rookie season.  Jones has thrown 384 times with plenty of games to play. Based on this metric alone, Jones has more trust and is on pace to throw more passes by the end of the season compared to Tom Brady.    Brady threw 413 passes in 2001. Jones has thrown 384 passes in 13 games. Jones could pass him in the Patriots' next game. Put simply, Jones has much more trust than Brady at this point in their respective careers.     "", ""Mac Jones or Ja'Marr Chase rookie of the year  Ja'Marr Chase, the Cincinnati Bengals rookie receiver, has exceeded expectations here at the halfway point of the 2021-2022 NFL season. Mac Jones, rookie quarterback of the New England Patriots, has also done his part to change the narrative as the last quarterback selected in the first round.   It's now more than halfway through the 2021 NFL season and the two, along with several other rookies, have already begun to make a name for themselves. Chase is an early candidate for Rookie of the Year, as he and his quarterback Joe Burrow picked up where they left off at LSU.        Another ROY candidate is Jones, who has been quietly consistent this season even when his team was struggling. Now, as the Patriots get back to their winning ways, more are noticing Jones' ability.           Who should win ROY: Mac Jones or Ja'Marr Chase? Ja'Marr Chase had a rough training camp this summer. He dropped more passes than he caught and there were plenty of skeptics wondering if he was going to live up to the hype.  Granted, quarterback Joe Burrow was limited in training camp and preseason play because of his ACL injury recovery from last season. But since Week 1, Chase has been one of the many reasons the Bengals have come alive in the AFC North. Chase was also named by FOX Sports as the mid-season MVP for his performance so far.  Through nine games this season, Chase has caught 44 passes for 835 yards and seven touchdowns.     The New England Patriots surprised everyone when they released quarterback Cam Newton just before Week 1 and named Mac Jones as their starting quarterback. After a rocky start to the season, the Patriots are now 6-4 and once again competing for an AFC East title after missing the playoffs last season.

[he was the 5th QB drafted] Jones has started all ten games and has thrown for 2,333 passing yards and 13 touchdowns. The comparisons between Jones and Tom Brady have been endless.  But between Chase and Jones, who is more likely to be named Rookie of the Year? There are plenty of other candidates as well, as this year's draft class was filled with immense talent.      Chase's performances this season have been a bit more consistent than Jones's. But Jones has the responsibility of leading an entire offense.

"", ""Why was Mac Jones benched?  New England Patriots quarterback Mac Jones was out for multiple weeks following a high ankle sprain. The injury limited his movement and forced him to undergo a procedure. In his place, Bailey Zappe was handed the keys to the offense and the rookie did a pretty good job.  However, with Mac Jones fit again, he was restored to the Patriots' starting lineup for their Week 7 game against the Chicago Bears. Unfortunately, the second-year shot-caller was relieved from duties going into the second half of the game, with Bailey Zappe replacing him again.        There were a lot of murmurs as the press speculated that we were about to have a quarterback situation in New England. Rumors swirled that Jones' days as a starter were over. That was until Bill Belichick appeared for the post-game press conference and gave his reasons for the quarterback swap. He said it was a pre-game decision to play both Jones and Zappe in Week 7.           He declined to say that the decision to put Zappe in the game was a benching of Jones. It was a coincidence that Jones had thrown an interception on the drive before the change. Will Jones be back at center in their next game against the New York Jets? It remains to be seen, as Belichick is a difficult coach to predict. Mac Jones' performances so far this season Chicago Bears v New England Patriots     Alabama Crimson Tide alum Mac Jones came into the season hoping to avoid a second-year slump. This sometimes happens with high-level athletes entering their second seasons as professionals. If you remember, Jones had to fight off competition from Cam Newton last campaign to become the Patriots' starting quarterback. However, this season he had no such challengers and he entered the year as the undisputed starting QB. Unfortunately, the season has not gone according to Jones' and the Patriots' plans. The franchise are 3-4 and Jones isn't faring much better. Mac Jones has recorded 799 passing yards, two touchdowns, and six interceptions in four games. If he wants to keep his starting job, he will have to improve his performances.        View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     ""]"

Sharpe states that the Bengals\' offensive line has been bad this season, but the Hall of Famer expected more from the young quarterback. ""I understand he was under duress,"" Sharpe said. ""But what people was crowing about and giving him so much credit for is that he\'s been able to perform really well while dealing with this kind of duress. Don\'t make it seem like oh, his offensive line is bad. They\'ve been bad. That’s why he led the league in sacks. Hell, that’s what knocked him out of the game two years ago.

He’s demonstrating that he’s one of the game’s best young talents under center while establishing a promising connection with rookie wideout Ja’Marr Chase, who has been producing at a historic pace. Chase has 27 catches for 553 receiving yards and five touchdowns. He ranks fourth in receiving yards, tied for fourth in touchdowns, and second with 20.5 yards per reception. The connection stemming from their time together at LSU has translated into immediate success for the 21-year-old wideout.

In January alone, he won two tournaments and was touted to bag the recently concluded Farmers Insurance Open as well. However, Rahm had a T7 finish. He was close to elimination after the first round, but he managed to find his footing in the second round to reach the third round. He maintained good form on the third day.     Rahm looked well on his way to clinching his third tournament title this season. However, he hit three birdies, three bogeys, and one double bogey in the final round. US golfer Max Homa came from behind to grab the Farmers Insurance Open title. Homa beat leader Sam Ryder to win the tournament. However, one bad performance doesn\'t negate the fact that Jon Rahm is a brilliant player and will do wonders in the coming events. He was headlining the Farmers Insurance Open alongside Justin Thomas. Prior to the tournament, Thomas tried to decode how Rahm has achieved so much success. He spoke to Sports Illustrated about it: ""When you start driving it like he does, hitting his irons like he does, and you get just a halfway decent putting week, yeah, he’s going to be tough to beat. I think even when some people, and I’m sure himself included, would say he was in a slump or whatever prior to that, he was still in contention and had a chance to win a lot of tournaments.""Justin Thomas is slated to play in several more tournaments. He will, of course, take part in the Masters in April, where he will look to bag the title. He, along with fellow PGA Tour players, will go against LIV Golf players at Augusta National.

Esiason threw for 522 yards and three touchdowns with four interceptions in a 37-34 win in overtime against the Washington Redskins. At the time, Esiason was only the seventh quarterback to throw for 500 yards in an NFL game and ranked third on the all-time list for most passing yards in a game. #4 - Joe Burrow - 525 yards vs. Baltimore Ravens Joe Burrow's incredible performance on Sunday against the Ravens landed him fourth spot on this list.

The match against the Bengals thus ended 34-23, and the Bucs fell to 6-8.  The match was even worse historically when you consider that one of Brady's most cherished records was broken in the process.

The match began with a Tom Brady drive that led to a nicely placed field goal from the Bucs' kicker, and then two touchdowns were added by the Bucs. The Bengals had to settle for a field goal of their own as they struggled to match the Bucs' efficiency. However, after the break, something switched, as Cincinnati came roaring back, powered by four touchdowns. To put it lightly, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defense was poor, but the offense was worse. Brady threw two interceptions, adding to two Tampa Bay fumbles.     The Buccaneers dug their own grave and Joe Burrow pushed them roughly into it. Burrow also racked up more touchdowns in the game than Tom Brady (four touchdowns to Brady's three) and it was a forgettable week for the Bucs.

Brady has thrown for 3,897 passing yards, 20 touchdowns, and seven interceptions in 14 games played this season. If Tampa Bay can win their next three fixtures, they will be guaranteed a spot in the playoffs by winning the underwhelming NFC South.The Bucs take on a weakened Arizona Cardinals in Week 16, a very winnable matchup. After the Cardinals, they face the Carolina Panthers and the Atlanta Falcons, both of whom are struggling this season.

46,Drew Stanton,"['Should the KC Chiefs select Geno Smith?  Geno Smith, Quarterback, West Virginia  Every pick in the NFL draft is important. Some are just more important than others. While taking a player in the 5th round who turns out to be a bust probably won’t hurt your team too much, you absolutely cannot afford to miss with the #1 overall pick. Just ask the Oakland Raiders, who selected quarterback JaMarcus Russell in 2007. He turned out to be arguably the biggest draft bust in NFL history, and the Raiders haven’t had a winning season since.        Sometimes it’s easy when you’re picking first. Last year the Indianapolis Colts chose the best time possible to win only two games all season. They ended up with their choice of Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III, which after having Peyton Manning for over a decade probably makes them the luckiest franchise in history! The Carolina Panthers in 2011 had a similarly comfortable position, taking Auburn’s star thrower Cam Newton. The St. Louis Rams and Detroit Lions had easy decisions to make too, taking Sam Bradford and Matt Stafford in ’09 and ’10. All those franchises found themselves in quite enviable positions.           This year’s draft class doesn’t have the “can’t-miss” future stars like Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III     The Kansas City Chiefs are in an unenviable position. For the first time in their history, the Chiefs hold that #1 overall pick, and it is not a good year for it. Nobody seems to know who they should take. There isn’t a Cam Newton or an Andrew Luck in this draft, so what should they do? Well, you still have to look at the quarterback position first and foremost. After all, twelve of the last fifteen #1 overall picks have been quarterbacks. It is the most important position on the field and every team knows that they aren’t going to win games if they don’t have a talented thrower. The Chiefs know it more than most; they are picking #1 overall precisely because they don’t have a talented thrower on the roster at the moment. Kansas City ranked dead last in passing yards in 2012, despite having some talent at the receiver position. 2011 first round draft choice Jon Baldwin, tight end Tony Moeaki and star man Dwayne Bowe, who had back to back 1,000 yard receiving seasons before the mess in 2012, are a potentially productive group. The talent on offense seems to be everywhere except quarterback. I don’t think you’ll find anybody who thinks that Head Coach Andy Reid and General Manager John Dorsey are going to stick with the incumbent and incapable duo of Matt Cassel and Brady Quinn. They need to find themselves a quarterback.     The problem is deciding who that new quarterback is going to be. There are a number of veteran options available, with guys like Alex Smith, Nick Foles and Matt Flynn sitting on the trading block, and Drew Stanton and Matt Moore available as free agents. Quite frankly, I’m not excited about any of those guys. Foles was with Reid in Philadelphia, and so Kansas City is a potential fit for him. I’m not buying it though. Foles isn’t the best choice in this group, and a deal is starting to look less and less likely. Alex Smith is actually the best talent available but I don’t know that he’s worth pursuing in a trade either, especially considering that his value is going to be inflated in a quarterback-sparse off season period. The Chiefs can’t afford to be giving up draft picks right now. There has been speculation that the Chiefs and 49ers are close to a deal to send Smith to Arrowhead, but really, so many sources are saying so many different things at the rumour-factory otherwise known as the NFL Combine that it is difficult to know what to believe. I’m choosing not to believe it.     That leaves the rookies. Oh boy, the rookies. All everybody has heard in the past two months is how poor this year’s quarterback draft class is. Mike Mayock, NFL’s draft guru, said recently on The Rich Eisen Podcast that he isn’t sure that there is a single quarterback worthy of a first round selection, never mind first overall. That’s concerning to say the least. The consensus is that Geno Smith is the best quarterback in this class. He is an athletic guy and he can make all the throws. Behind him, there are a number of players that are jostling for recognition, including Matt Barkley, Ryan Nassib, Tyler Wilson and Mike Glennon. They all have their strengths, but nobody seems to have fallen in love with them. If the Chiefs are taking a quarterback #1 overall, it’s going to be Geno Smith. Geno Smith is the consensus #1 Quarterback, but will he be the #1 overall pick?     There are a number things here for the Chiefs to consider if they want to pick Smith in this draft. First of all, they have to be happy with their situation at left tackle. Current starter Brandon Albert is hitting free agency, and while it has been reported that the Chiefs are trying to resign him, if they don’t hold onto Albert there will be a big gap to fill on the offensive line. If that happens, I think that the Chiefs will have to look at taking Luke Joeckel, probably the most talented player in the draft, with the #1 overall pick. If Albert does sign, taking Joeckel doesn’t make much sense. Secondly, Andy Reid has to be comfortable with what he’s got to work with on the defensive side of the ball before he can commit to taking a quarterback. Glenn Dorsey is almost certainly leaving in free agency, and former first round pick Tyson Jackson might also be out of the door.     Star Lotuleilei would add some much needed talent to Kansas City’s defensive front In any event, Jackson has been underwhelming in his first four season, recording only 5 sacks in his 59 NFL games. Ndamukong Suh had 10 sacks in his rookie season alone as an interior pass rusher. Marcell Dareus has surpassed 5 sacks in each of his first two seasons. Dareus and Jackson were both taken with the 3rd overall pick in their respective draft class. Suffice to say, Andy Reid is very thin on the defensive line. With 2012 pro bowlers Tamba Hali, Justin Houston, Derrick Johnson, Eric Berry and Brandon Flowers at linebacker and defensive back, a solid defensive line would probably push this defensive unit to the next level. With that in mind, the powers that be in Kansas are going to be very tempted to select Utah’s Star Lotuleilei or Florida’s Shariff Floyd to make that happen. One point of interest to note here is that during Andy Reid’s tenure in Philadelphia, the Eagles had 12 first round picks and took 6 defensive linemen. Reid really likes strengthening the trenches.     If they are comfortable with the defensive line, and that is a big ‘if’, then the final question to ask is: ‘Is Geno Smith good enough to be taken with the #1 Overall pick?’ My gut reaction to that question is ‘no’. Mainly because that is the majority opinion on him. Smith is probably a first round talent, contrary to Mike Mayock’s belief, but drafting him #1 overall seems like a reach. In most other years, he might not be anywhere near the top of draft boards. Unfortunately, in a quarterback driven league, it is a reach the Chiefs might have to make. They can’t settle for Matt Cassell after his performance this season, and the options in free agency are limited at best. What else can they do? Well, another option would be to trade down, and perhaps take Smith with a lower pick that better suits his value. It was reported that Andy Reid has put a ‘for sale’ sign on the #1 overall pick and is willing to listen to offers. A lot of fans on the Chiefs message boards believe that this is by far the best strategy for the Chiefs to employ.     It is all well and good saying that the best idea would be to trade down and collect more draft picks, but that only works if someone is willing to pay the price and move up. I don’t think the fish will bite on this one. It’s a classic contradiction; the Chiefs wouldn’t be trying to trade down if there was a player worth trading up for. I think the Chiefs are probably stuck with it, which means Dorsey and Reid are going to have some serious thinking to do before April if they are going to figure out this riddle. All things considered, drafting Smith might not be the worst decision to make. While he isn’t a Cam Newton or Andrew Luck, he doesn’t really need to be. The Chiefs had the 5th best rushing attack in football this past year with Jamaal Charles leading the way. So, they are probably going to lean on the run game no matter who is there at quarterback. Smith won’t be asked to come in and throw 600 times like Andrew Luck was last season. He just has to be a game manager, and get the ball out to his receivers enough so that defences can’t bring 8 guys up to the line of scrimmage. He is definitely talented enough for that. Alex Smith is also good enough for that though, and he’s more tested. If the trade rumours are true, then Geno Smith can kiss goodbye to going #1 overall. Right now, the Chiefs should be looking at four players – Geno Smith, Luke Joeckel, Star Lutoleilei and Shariff Floyd. If the trade for Alex Smith doesn’t happen, if Brandon Albert resigns and if Reid is comfortable with what he has on defence, then Smith could possibly be the choice in April. There are a lot of “ifs” in that scenario, however. The way I see it, Andy Reid can probably find a way to be comfortable, taking one of the other quarterbacks with their second round pick, perhaps Ryan Nassib, and use the #1 overall to address the needy defensive line and create an elite, top 5 defence at Arrowhead.

More importantly, six of his ten punts landed inside the 49ers\' 20-yard line, which proved crucial.

But things on the ground during the April 16 spring game that pitted White vs. Orange painted a different story. Most critics saw the highly-hyped Manning\'s unofficial college football debut as a flop.  The five-star New Orleans native and nephew of Hall of Famer Peyton Manning failed to impress as Maalik Murphy’s backup for the Orange team. He struggled to hit his stride, completing only five of his 13 passing attempts for 30 yards and no score.        Eli Manning: Don’t read too much into Arch’s spring and postseason performance      Arch\'s other uncle, two-time Super Bowl champion Eli Manning, has pushed back against criticism leveled at the star after the spring game. The former New York Giants QB knows all too well that these setbacks are part of the journey. “For me, I don’t remember many of my spring games,” the two-time Super Bowl MVP said while speaking to Sports Illustrated at the Manning Passing Academy at Nicholls State in Thibodaux, Louisiana. “I don’t remember many of my preseason games. Spring games, you can’t look too much into it."" He also argued that Arch was still technically a high school senior when he played in the Longhorns’ spring game.     “I know, for him, it’s about getting in there, getting into practices, getting in the weight room (and) learning the playbook,” the 42-year-old NFL legend said. Arch enrolled a semester early at Texas after getting lots of traction during the recruiting rounds. He was a five-star recruit, ranking as such by all big four recruiting media companies: ESPN, Rivals, 247Sports and On3. The hotly sought-after quarterback picked the Longhorns over a handful of other top-tier programs, including the Crimson Tide, Clemson Tigers, Georgia Bulldogs and LSU Tigers. Despite the slight backlash, Eli believes that Arch’s early enrollment at Texas will pay off in the long haul. The 6-foot-4 quarterback completed his senior year at Isadore Newman with 2,407 yards and 34 touchdowns, placing him at the top of the 2023 recruiting class. That’s why expectations among analysts and Texas fans are sky-high from the get-go.On this part, Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian has said that he won\'t rush Manning along. He plans to have him play second fiddle to the incumbent QB come the start of the season as Texas battles for a spot in the Big 12 championship game.     ', '""It’s so beautiful"" - LeBron James left in awe over Tom Brady\'s performance against Falcons  Los Angeles Lakers star forward LeBron James and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady are all-time talents in their respective leagues. At six foot eight inches and 250 lbs., James is built like an NFL player in every way, and last year and during the NBA lockout in 2011, it could have been a reality. In an appearance on ManningCast, the Monday Night Football alternative with brothers Peyton Manning and Eli Manning, the four-time NBA MVP disclosed that the two teams offered him a contract. He told the Manning Brothers on the Week Three telecast:  “[Cowboys owner] Jerry Jones offered me a contract. Also [Seahawks coach] Pete Carroll did as well in Seattle during our lockout time.”        What most fans may not know about the 17-time NBA All-Star is that James had a great football career at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was a first-team all-state wide receiver, playing in his sophomore and junior years. In his two-year high school football career, James had 103 catches, 2,065 receiving yards and 23 touchdowns.

It’s so beautiful2:06 AM · Dec 5, 202113100945I can watch TB12 throw a football/run a offense all day long man!!! It’s so beautiful It became clear why Jerry Jones and Pete Carroll wanted to sign the NBA star. However, in an alternate universe, if he did decide to sign with the Dallas Cowboys or Seattle Seahawks, James might have faced Brady. Yet that didn\'t stop James from watching his greatness from afar as he did versus the Atlanta Falcons.     James compliments Brady\'s performance Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady In the second quarter of the Buccaneers game versus the Atlanta Falcons in Week 13, Tom Brady engineered a 12 play, 85-yard drive that took three minutes and 45 seconds. On that drive, the 14-time Pro Bowl quarterback went five of seven for 67 yards, ending with a 27-yard touchdown to tight end Rob Gronkowski to go up 20-10. James was so impressed that he tweeted that he could watch Brady engineer an offense, saying:     “It’s so beautiful” It is always a great time to see greatness acknowledging greatness and this is a great example of King James and the GOAT. Like James, we are all in awe of Brady and can still lead a team at age 44 with such poise. It was a beautiful thing to watch, no matter if you love Brady or not.Chase@ExcIuslvesIf my kid doesn’t think Tom Brady and Lebron James are the best to ever do it they’re grounded.

Both are former quarterbacks in the NFL who hail from the same family. They were both selected first overall in their respective drafts and both won two Super Bowls.  There is little doubt, though, who the better quarterback was between them. Peyton Manning is a Hall-of-Famer. He famously changed the league in how quarterbacks would react at the line of scrimmage and change plays. He holds the record for most touchdown passes in a season with 55. He reached four Super Bowls compared to the two of his younger brother. His overall impact on the game has been much greater than Eli Manning's.        Denver Broncos@BroncosLegacy cemented.

Peyton Manning won both Super Bowl XLI (2007) and 50 (2016) and was the Super Bowl MVP in the former. Eli Manning won Super Bowls XLII (2008) and XLVI (2012) and was the Super Bowl MVP both times. Let's look deeper to decide which of the Manning brothers fared better in their Super Bowl wins. Peyton Manning and Eli Manning: A Super Bowl matchup     Indianapolis Colts vs. New York Giants (image credit - Bleacher Report) Peyton Manning played in four Super Bowls and won two. He won one and lost one with both the Indianapolis Colts and the Denver Broncos. In the ones where he did win, how much of a contribution to the eventual glory did he actually have? In Super Bowl XLI against the Chicago Bears, the Colts quarterback threw one touchdown and an interception and was sacked once. His passer rating was 81.8 and he passed for 247 yards. As mentioned before, that was enough to win him the Super Bowl MVP nod.     In Super Bowl 50 against the Carolina Panthers, his powers had clearly waned in what turned out to be his last season in the NFL. He threw for only 141 yards and did not have a single touchdown. However, he did throw an interception. He was sacked five times for a loss of 37 yards in total. He ended up with a passer rating of 56.6. The Broncos won the game because of their defense and Von Miller took home the Super Bowl MVP award. Now, let's take a look at Eli Manning. He won both his Super Bowls with the New York Giants against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. His first outing was in Super Bowl XLII. The Giants defeated the Patriots, who were coming off a perfect season until then, so the relative strength of the opposition was higher than what his elder brother faced.

Though he was sacked thrice, he only gave up a total of eight yards on those sacks. He passed for a total of 255 yards as he was named the Super Bowl MVP with a 87.3 passer rating. Note here that all the figures are already better than Peyton Manning achieved in either of his Super Bowl wins. But for the younger Manning, his best performance in a Super Bowl was to come in the XLVI edition. In that game, he threw for one touchdown and had no interceptions. His total passing yards were 296, achieved by connecting on 30 out of 40 attempts at an astounding 75% completion rate. His passer rating was accordingly 103.8 as he again walked away with the Super Bowl MVP award.        Consider also that Eli Manning never lost a Super Bowl, whereas his brother lost two. That in itself is a pretty impressive stat.Upon reflection, it is clear that Eli Manning has far outstripped his more illustrious brothers when it comes to Super Bowl performances. Peyton Manning may have achieved quite a lot, but when it came to crunch time, his younger brother held his nerve much better.     "", 'Tom Brady vs Eli Manning: Who had the last laugh?  Former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning reignited the family\'s long-running rivalry with Tom Brady earlier this week with some dad jokes on Father’s Day.

Tom Brady vs Peyton Manning AFC Championship - New England Patriots v Denver Broncos The two legendary quarterbacks have faced each other 17 times in the NFL. Tom Brady has a dominating 11-6 record over the older Manning brother and will go down in NFL history as the more vaunted quarterback.

Eli Manning holds a 3-2 win record over Brady and is the only man who can say he beat Tom Brady in two Super Bowls. Manning led the New York Giants to victory at Super Bowl XLII, defeating the previously unbeaten Patriots 17-14 in an enthralling showdown. The Giants QB was crowned the Super Bowl MVP for his performance. Four years later, Manning and the Giants did it again, beating Tom Brady and the New England Patriots at Super Bowl XLVI 21-17 in another classic championship game.

', 'New York Giants great Eli Manning recalls trying to emulate Derek Jeter\'s stature in New York as a rookie: ""You want to get to Derek Jeter level""  Derek Jeter is not only a New York icon, but a sports icon. He was the face of the most recognizable sports team in the world for about two decades, winning five championships and cementing his status as an all-time champion.  However, he\'s not the only New York sports icon. He transcends the city, but he also shares it. In the NFL, Eli Manning is that sports icon. He is a two-time Super Bowl winning quarterback for the New York Giants.        When Manning first got to New York as a rookie in 2004, Jeter was well established. He had already won four of his five rings and had been in the league for nine full years at that point.      Manning recalls thinking he needed to be like Jeter when he first entered the league, as he told the former New York Yankees star on the Eli Manning Show.    Manning recalled a brutal performance with a zero quarterback rating, but that Jeter called him to lend some advice:     ""You called me... \'Keep grinding, keep your head up, New York\'s a tough place.\' It meant a lot to me cause when I was coming into New York, you were the role model. You were kinda, \'Hey, this is where you want to get to. You want to get to Derek Jeter level.\'"" Jeter\'s advice must have helped Manning because he would go on to become one of the most iconic players in New York football history.  How long did Derek Jeter play in New York? Derek Jeter was a longtime Yankee and he had the benefit of never playing anywhere else, something a lot of players today cannot say. He debuted in 1995, though he only played in 15 games. The following year, he won Rookie of the Year.     Derek Jeter retired in 2014He would go on to play for the Yankees until 2014 when he retired. He never had any major injury issues, save for a 2013 season (when he was 39) when he only played 17 games.Other than that, he never played less than 119 games and other than that season, never less than 148.

Prior to Isidore Newman School\'s game on Friday, Arch was 110 yards away from breaking Eli\'s all-time career passing record of 7,268 at Isidore Newman School.

In five games this season for Isidore Newman, Arch has thrown for 1,126 yards, 20 touchdowns, and zero interceptions with a 129.9 quarterback rating.

And after his start against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 4, Haskins was thrown under the bus by his own teammate on Twitter.        Undrafted rookie quarterback Steven Montez recently liked a tweet from a passionate Washington Football fan, who called Haskins \'garbage\'.           Washington backup QB Steven Montez likes tweet calling Dwayne Haskins ""garbage"" pic.twitter.com/ByAsRyQRK3— Main Team (@MainTeamSports) December 22, 2020 It\'s safe to say that most fans also agree that Haskins simply has not been competent enough during his run with Washington. Against the Seahawks, Haskins completed 38 of 55 passes for 295 yards with one touchdown and two passes. While he certainly made an effort to give Washington a win, it ultimately went in vain.  What is plaguing Dwayne Haskins?     Dwayne Haskins was benched and considered the third-string quarterback after his Week 4 performance against the Baltimore Ravens. He was placed behind Kyle Allen and veteran Alex Smith at that time.  After Kyle Allen\'s season-ending injury, Haskins was promoted to back up veteran Alex Smith, who has won four of five games as the starter. However, Smith strained his right calf against the San Francisco 49ers, rendering him unable to return to that game.  It seemed like the coaching staff wanted to be cautious with his calf, considering his horrendous injury back in 2018 on the same right leg.With the playoffs around the corner coupled with Smith\'s questionable performance in Week 16 against Carolina Panthers, Dwayne Haskins could be up for another start. But his recent off-field issue with violating the COVID-19 protocol, again could give another QB like Steven Montez a chance to take the helm for Washington.

Head coach Ron Rivera did a fabulous job rallying his young team and is expected to make another postseason appearance this season. That won’t be easy, though, as the NFC East divisional rivals are loading up in free agency.        Competition for roster spots will be fierce during this year’ training camp, and several Washington players will be under pressure to prove why they deserve to remain on the roster.           Washington Football Team players who need big training-camp performances          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Washington Football Team (@washingtonnfl) #1 Steve Sims Jr. The wide receiver is under pressure to keep his roster spot after a couple of inconsistent seasons in Washington. Sims had some key drops last season and has been plagued by injuries.     Washington signed receiver Adam Humphries and drafted Dax Milne to play in the slot. Sims can return punts, but there are concerns about his ball security in special teams. The 24-year-old wideout will need a strong training camp to remain in the team for the upcoming 2021 season.  #2 Landon Collins Veteran safety Landon Collins could be on his way out of the nation's capital. The 27-year-old had an injury-riddled campaign last year, and his hefty salary could lead to him being cut early during training camp. The former Giants defensive leader has failed to live up to his previous performances. It could be a make-or-break training camp for Collins, in that regard.  #3 Beau Benzschawel Second-year guard Beau Benzschawel could find himself as the odd man out in Washington's offensive line group this season. The 25-year-old sits behind starter Wes Schweitzer and backup Erick Flowers in the left-guard depth chart. Benzschawel will need to show the Washington coaches that he deserves to be kept around in 2021.              View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Washington Football Team (@washingtonnfl)  #4 Kyle Allen Backup quarterback Kyle Allen could be a surprise cut during this year’s training camp. The 25-year-old play-caller will be in a battle with Taylor Heineke for being the second-string QB behind Ryan Fitzpatrick in 2021. If Allen loses to Heineke, the team or even Allen himself might look to move on. Allen threw for 610 yards with four touchdowns and one interception in limited game time last year.  #5 Isaiah Wright The second-year wide receiver finds himself in a battle to keep his spot in 2021. The undrafted rookie featured in 14 games last season, recording 27 receptions for 197 yards and zero touchdowns.Like Steve Sims Jr., Wright will have to beat out new wide receiver signing Adam Humphries and rookie Dax Milne in the Washington Football Team's training camp.

News broke on Monday that the Washington Football Team had released quarterback Dwayne Haskins, an expected move after his performance against the Carolina Panthers in what was a must-win game for Washington to secure a spot in the playoffs.  Haskins had his ups and downs in the 2020 season, as the second-year QB started the first four games of the season, going 1-3. He was benched and demoted to third-string QB after that and Kyle Allen was named the starter, with veteran Alex Smith as the backup.

Eventually, Smith became the starting quarterback with Haskins being his backup. It wasn't expected for Haskins to ever see the field again unless Washington couldn't make it to the playoffs, but the day came when Smith was injured against the San Francisco 49ers and Haskins took over for the next two and a half games. His performance was average at best but was simply not good against the Panthers last week.      Will Dwayne Haskins ever see the field again? Many believe that Haskins' career as an NFL QB is simply done for. But since his rookie season, he has shown signs of being a star quarterback for a team willing to take a risk. Haskins is considered an old-school quarterback and not as mobile as many up-and-coming QBs in the league currently. That was one reason why he wasn't taken ahead of New York Giants' quarterback Daniel Jones in the same draft class. The fact of the matter is that Haskins needs to sit for a whole season behind a seasoned veteran, similar to Alex Smith. Teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers, New England Patriots, Atlanta Falcons, and even the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could sit a young guy who needs to mature over time to show what he can do on the field again.

Learn from this and bounce back— Robert Griffin III (@RGIII) December 28, 2020     He may not have worked out in the system that Washington has created, but Haskins could work out elsewhere. The situation brought to Haskins reminds us of Josh Rosen, who was drafted in the first round and then cut after one season with the Arizona Cardinals.Since then, he has been around a few teams and on practice squads. But Haskins certainly has more talent than Rosen, it's simply a matter of time and maturity for the former Ohio State quarterback.

The Carolina Panthers are taking on the Denver Broncos, but what you might notice is that Baker Mayfield isn't the starting quarterback. The former Cleveland Browns QB has had an up-and-down start to his life with the Panthers and it hasn't taken long for him to be benched.  Many thought Mayfield's acquisition would present a change in fortunes for the NFC franchise, but it hasn't worked out that may. The 27-year-old is a poor 1-5 on the season, forcing interim head coach Steve Wilks' hand to give Sam Darnold a start over Mayfield.

Panthers begin life without Baker Mayfield against the Broncos Sam Darnold - Carolina Panthers v Baltimore Ravens     Both the Panthers and the Broncos come into the Week 12 clash with only three wins each. It is not exactly the way they were hoping their season was going to go. For the Panthers, they simply can't get settled at the quarterback position. P.J. Walker Jacob Eason and Mayfield have all tried their hand, but have had zero success.    Now it's Darnold's turn to try and salvage something from the season. Carolina only averages 18 points a game (ranks 25th in the league) while they give up 23 points per game on average (ranks 19th).     The Panthers could only manage three points against the Baltimore Ravens last Sunday and that proved to be the final straw as Darnold was handed his first start of the season. Josh Graham@JoshGrahamRadioI’ll give Baker Mayfield this: he’s not just standing around on the sideline as a backup.He’s been engaged behind the bench — likely watching some all-22 video of the last offensive drive — and been in Sam Darnold’s ear helping him out.#KeepPounding5I’ll give Baker Mayfield this: he’s not just standing around on the sideline as a backup.He’s been engaged behind the bench — likely watching some all-22 video of the last offensive drive — and been in Sam Darnold’s ear helping him out.#KeepPounding https://t.co/Kzv7fqhGSW Whether or not the quarterback change will translate into a better offensive production is not yet known.

As of now, third-year QB Kyle Allen is under center for the Washington Football Team. He was given the starting job after head coach Ron Rivera benched Dwayne Haskins, demoting him all the way to third-string and making veteran Alex Smith the backup.

By being demoted to third-string, Rivera and the coaching staff have likely given up on the Haskins project. It is certainly time for both parties to move on, allowing Haskins a fresh start and for Washington to gain back some capital.     For now, there are no rumors saying the Washington Football Team is interested in trading for a quarterback. Several teams have been rumored to be putting their signal-caller on the trading block, including the Atlanta Falcons\' Matt Ryan, the Indianapolis Colts\' Jacoby Brissett, and the Chicago Bears\' Mitchell Trubisky. Of those three, Ryan would be the best solution in terms of performance. But getting Ryan would require the Washington Football Team to release Smith, as they cannot take on both contracts at the same time. Another option that was considered before the season started was Cam Newton, who was signed by the New England Patriots. Newton has been struggling since his return to the field after being diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus. It was previously reported that the Patriots were worried about Washington signing Newton and thus made the move before them. Considering Rivera and Newton worked together in Carolina for nine seasons, it makes sense for Washington to bring Newton to Rivera and the coaching staff that he would be very familiar with.     The #Patriots consider Washington a threat to sign QB Cam Newton this offseason, per a report from Albert Breer.— JPA (@jpafootball) October 20, 2020 Right now, Rivera and the Washington Football Team front office have made it clear that they want to win. They are not openly tanking, unlike some teams in the league that are doing so for higher draft picks. Washington has a great chance of making it to the top of the division and into the playoffs. The time is right now to do so, and they are certainly an elite quarterback away from dominating.

The Carolina Panthers are another surprise success story, while the Dallas Cowboys have taken a turn for the worse over the last few weeks. Here we look back at the biggest headlines from Week 6 and the impact they will have heading into Week 7. Are quarterback changes coming to NFC South? Jameis Winston threw five interceptions and fumbled twice in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\' loss to the Panthers as they dropped to 2-4, but head coach Bruce Arians made it clear the team are not considering replacing him — yet. ""No. I look at the reasons why. What happened?"" Arians told reporters, noting the team\'s battered line was partly to blame for the ugly outing. ""If it happens again, yeah, it\'ll concern the hell out of me."" Similarly, the Panthers may not be looking to put Cam Newton back in and bench Kyle Allen after the second-year quarterback helped pull the Panthers out of their 0-2 hole to start the season. In fact, Allen could keep the starting job as long as he keeps winning, though coach Ron Rivera remained tight-lipped on the subject Sunday.      ""I\'m not going to worry about it,"" Rivera said. ""I\'m not going to speculate on anything until I have to address that. So until then, we\'re going to stay in the now, stay in the focus of what we\'re doing right now. As far as I\'m concerned, we\'re not going to deal with the question until it is time. And when the time comes, I will address it."" An ESPN report on Monday said Newton is almost ready to resume practicing. Both Carolina and Tampa Bay will be on their bye in Week 6, so stay tuned. Mariota era could be winding down in Nashville Quarterback controversy struck Tennessee as the Titans pulled the second draft pick of 2015 in the team\'s shut-out loss to the Denver Broncos for veteran backup Ryan Tannehill. Marcus Mariota was sacked three times and completed just seven of 18 passes for 63 yards with two interceptions before getting the hook. Tannehill was better, completing 13 of 16 passes for 144 yards with a pick.     As for who will start Week 6 against the Los Angeles Chargers, the team expect to have an answer by Tuesday. ""I think a decision will be made this evening, or tomorrow, and we’ll let everybody know — we’ll let the players involved know, and let the team know and then let you guys know,"" coach Mike Vrabel told reporters. ""I just want to make sure we are going through everything that we need to go through and what we are doing offensively, and not use the emotion of the game to make a decision."" Can 49ers make statement by extending win streak? With the Patriots on a bye, the Niners have a chance to match their perfect 6-0 record after dismantling defending NFC champions the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. The 49ers held Los Angeles to 3.3 yards per play, which is the lowest average in Rams franchise history, and quarterback Jared Goff had his worst performance to date as he completed 13 of 24 for a career-low 78 yards.     San Francisco have shined as arguably the most surprising team this year after the 49ers managed just four wins all last season. Now 5-0 for the first time since 1990, the Niners may only gain momentum with matchups against the Washington Redskins, Panthers and Arizona Cardinals looming. Falcons giving Quinn until bye week to turn things around Atlanta will host the Rams and Seattle Seahawks in back-to-back games before getting some rest Week 9, and after a 1-5 start just two and a half years removed from their trip to Super Bowl LI, the team are running short of patience. NFL Media reported that Falcons owner Arthur Blank wants to see progress over the next couple of weeks ""or changes could come,"" with the fifth-year coach as one of them. Dan Quinn already fired all three of his co-ordinators before the season started, so the blame would have to fall on him. Jay Gruden may have been the first coach to get the axe, but he certainly will not be the last, and it appears Quinn has two weeks to save his job.     Amari Cooper\'s potential absence could have big implications Cowboys receiver Amari Cooper\'s status for Week 6 reportedly ""is in serious question"" after he was diagnosed with a bruised thigh suffered in Sunday\'s loss to the Jets. Dallas coach Jason Garrett said the team are taking his injury day by day, but could not guarantee his availability. The ailment could not come at a worse time considering Dallas have dropped three straight games and face a key game in Week 6 against NFC East rivals the Philadelphia Eagles. A fourth consecutive loss could officially put Garrett on the hot seat, though Cowboys owner Jerry Jones insisted it has not come to that yet. ""I haven\'t even glanced there in my mind about long-term future,"" Jones told reporters. ""The big thing I want to say is it\'s not just him. This is across the board, and that had a lot of input out here tonight to get in that spot.""     Garrett, who is entering the final year of his contract, reiterated that getting the team to the top of the NFC East is his main concern.""I\'m focused on doing my job as well as I can do it,"" Garrett said, per The Athletic.

', 'NFL Fantasy Football Week 13: Quarterback rankings  A case can be made that, like the NFL, quarterbacks are also the most important players in Fantasy Football. This is because they are often the highest scoring players each week. Their massive fantasy scores have a direct impact on the outcome of just about every matchup in Fantasy Football. This makes it extremely important for managers to solidify their quarterback position.  One of the best ways to get the most out of the fantasy quarterback position each week is to closely analyze their direct weekly matchups and recent individual performances. This can help managers make informed decisions about who to start each week.                      Week 13 of the 2022 NFL season features two teams on a bye week. This means that all players from the Arizona Cardinals and Carolina Panthers will be unavailable for Fantasy Football this week. Fantasy managers with Kyler Murray on their roster will need to find a replacement this week as he is often a regular starter. Sam Darnold is relatively irrelevant for fantasy purposes, but he will also be unavailable this week due to the bye week. The upcoming rankings could potentially help managers when setting their lineups for Week 13 of the 2022 Fantasy Football season. It may be especially useful for Murray owners, DFS players, and those who use a streaming strategy.

49,Josh Allen,"['""Mr. January because he never makes it to February"" - Josh Allen gets mercilessly roasted on social media after Bengals beat Bills in Buffalo\xa0  Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills\' quest to win the franchise\'s first Super Bowl ended in brutal fashion as Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals rolled into Highmark Stadium and beat them 27-10.  As opposed to last year\'s gut-wrenching overtime loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, the Bills were blown away by the Bengals, who advanced to the AFC Championship game. They will take on Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium.        Josh Allen attempted 42 passes and completed 25 for 265 yards and no touchdowns with one interception. He rushed eight times for 26 yards and scored the Bills\' only touchdown. On the flip side, Burrow completed 23 of his 36 pass attempts for 242 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 32 yards on six carries, leading the Bengals to a blowout win.           NFL fans on social media mercilessly criticized Allen\'s performance.

Painful playoff losses becoming a trend for Josh Allen and the Bills     For the third straight season, Josh Allen and the Bills failed to end the franchise\'s long wait for a Super Bowl appearance. The team suffered a lopsided 38-24 loss to Mahomes and the Chiefs in the 2020-21 AFC Championship Game, but a year later, pushed Kansas City to the brink of elimination, only to give up enough yards in 13 seconds to see them score a game-tying field goal and force overtime. Mahomes and the Chiefs scored on the opening possession in overtime to eliminate the Bills in the divisional round.

', 'NFL analyst challenges Josh Allen to overcome last season’s ‘alarming’ performances in 2023 - “He has the most to prove”  For Josh Allen, there has been a lot of discussion about his performances since last season came to a disappointing end to the Cincinnati Bengals.  There were no doubts that the best three teams in the conference were the Bengals, the Buffalo Bills and the Kansas City Chiefs, but the cold reality is that the Bills lost in the playoffs three straight times for the other two opponents.         Even worse, the 33-14 loss to the Bengals in January had Allen with such a poor performance that star wide receiver Stefon Diggs was screaming at him on the sidelines.           The quarterback\'s talent is not a question by any means, but the pressure is starting to mount after not reaching the Super Bowl in the past few years, while Mahomes and Burrow dominated the conference over the last four seasons.  ESPN analyst Freddie Coleman gave his verdict on First Take, and he believes that this is a year where Allen is under immense pressure: “I hate to do this to Josh Allen, because I think he and I know he\'s an elite quarterback in the NFL. But he has the most to prove, especially after last year, because how much do we hear? To be fair, the Damar Hamlin situation at the end of the season would wreck a lot of teams, but I thought, even before that happened, he did not deal [well] with the pressure.""      ""Those 14 interceptions were alarming. I thought he put too much on himself, and you can\'t be the best quarterback and the best running back with all that pressure, and think that\'s going to work in your favor.” Is Josh Allen good? Is he an elite quarterback? He\'s an excellent quarterback who isn\'t afraid of absolutely nothing, whether it\'s taking risks with his throws in tight windows, throwing a bomb with his strong arm or hitting a defender when he\'s running with the football. With an arm capable of making any and all types of throws, he can pull an explosive play out of nowhere at any time. He has also greatly improved his decision-making -- and because of his arm strength, he can connect with his receivers in windows that most quarterbacks don\'t even see.     There\'s no doubt he belongs to the \'elite\' tier.When will the Buffalo Bills start the 2023 season?They have a mouth-watering matchup against the Aaron Rodgers-led New York Jets on September 11, during a Monday Night Football game.Apart from the 22nd anniversary of September 11, 2001, Allen and Rodgers going head-to-head will be one of the best quarterback duels of the season.     ', 'Josh Allen addresses poor performance in The Match, claims he was carried by Patrick Mahomes  Josh Allen may be one of the top quarterbacks in football, but the golf course shows a different side of his athletic abilities, or lack thereof. The Buffalo Bills signal-caller teamed up with AFC rival Patrick Mahomes this week to take part in the charity golf event known as The Match.  The two young quarterbacks went up against the old-timers of the NFC in Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers. Rodgers seemed to be the most gifted among the foursome, although Patrick Mahomes had some nice-looking shots as well.        The following day, Allen took to Twitter to check on his partner’s back and added a little self-deprecation.           Josh Allen@JoshAllenQB@PatrickMahomes is your back ok? 🤣Not gonna lie, I was a garbage can today but we will be back 14380391@PatrickMahomes is your back ok? 🤣Not gonna lie, I was a garbage can today but we will be back 😁 The Match was pretty close throughout the day, with the young team coming from behind a couple of strokes to tie it up. In the end, it was a beautifully hit putt on the final hole that drove home the win for Brady and Rodgers. In Allen’s defense, it seemed as though he started to heat up as the day went along and even narrowly missed dropping in an incredibly long putt on the final hole.     What Allen lacked in golf skills he more than made up for in trash talk. After an impressive drive by Rodgers, the Bills quarterback commented on how good his opponent was and credited it to Rodgers skipping OTAs. Allen was also the target of several verbal jabs from Brady, mostly concerning his weight and lack of Super Bowl wins. The trash talk was apparent among the announcers as well, which included NBA great Charles Barkley and Arizona Cardinals sackmaster J.J. Watt.        Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes put their rivalry on the back burner for a round of charity golf Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes gave NFL fans one of the most thrilling games of all time in last season’s AFC divisional round. The two have been labeled the next Brady and Manning in their fledgling rivalry that, thus far, has gone in Mahomes’ favor.        As the 2022 season approaches, Allen will look to turn the tide in the rivalry and lead his Buffalo Bills through the playoffs and to the Super Bowl. Mahomes, meanwhile, will attempt to get back there without one of his biggest weapons in Tyreek Hill. The lightning-quick wide receiver suits up this season as a Miami Dolphin.With The Match behind him, Allen looks forward to rejoining the Bills and charging into the season opener against the defending world champion Los Angeles Rams.Also Checkout:- Patrick Mahomes House     ', ""Josh Allen cold weather stats: How effective is Bills QB in a freezing environment?  Josh Allen is playing his fifth season with the Buffalo Bills and cold weather shouldn't be a problem for him. Snow is expected for Saturday night's game between the Bills and Miami Dolphins at Highmark Stadium, which will be their second meeting this season.  Josh Allen has played four games this season where the temperatures have fallen below 40 degrees. He has won three out of those four games and so, will be having a weather advantage in the upcoming contest.        Temperatures are expected to go as low as 29 degrees, and Tua Tagovailoa is known to struggle in cold weather games.           Josh Allen lost the first game played in sub-40 degrees conditions, against the Minnesota Vikings, in Week 10. With winds sweeping at 11 miles per hour, the temperature dropped to 38 degrees. Vikings with a 8-1 record then, defeated the Bills, 33-30. Allen threw for 330 yards with a pass completion percentage of 67.44, and one touchdown.    Since then, the Bills have been playing in much colder temperatures and have won all their games, against the Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, and the New York Jets.     Despite winning, Josh Allen's performances saw a drop in these games. He threw for less than 250+ yards and had four passing touchdowns in all three games, which saw temperatures below 40 degrees.

"", ""Stefon Diggs breaks silence about losing it at Josh Allen during loss to Bengals  The Buffalo Bills were the biggest disappointment for the Divisional Round as they were no match for the Cincinnati Bengals at home and lost 27-10, ending their AFC playoff run sooner than expected.  The Bengals were the dominant team from start to finish, and clearly, the Bills were not up to their regular standards.

It's nothing new from the receiver to scream at his quarterback, but it's an uncommon scene since he moved from Minnesota to Buffalo. Barstool Sports@barstoolsportsStefon Diggs is fed up with Josh Allen489932835Stefon Diggs is fed up with Josh Allen https://t.co/ybOsAiJt7b Diggs recorded only 35 yards on four throws by Allen as the Bills couldn't muster a productive offense in the heavy snow. The team was considered one of the favorites to win the conference, but there's a long offseason to go after a second straight loss in the Divisional Round.     This is where Damar Hamlin's situation became a competitive problem for Buffalo. With the Week 17 game against Cincinnati being canceled, the Bills lost the advantage for the first seed in the AFC and couldn't avoid the Bengals in the Divisional Round. The Chiefs, who benefited because of their winning percentage, made light work of the Jaguars. What's next for Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills? One of the main reasons the team struggled in the second half of the season was because of injuries. Although Allen was still playing, he was dealing with a UCL injury that made it painful for him to throw the football. He was far from his best during the loss against the Bengals. Buffalo was a different team - and not in a positive manner - once Von Miller went down for the season with a torn ACL. Hamlin's injury also hurt during the playoffs because he had become a valuable starter following Micah Hyde's injury.For now, they need to get healthy and take an honest look in the mirror to discover why they couldn't win the AFC in the previous three seasons with one of the most talented rosters in the league.     "", 'Tom Brady hits back at Josh Allen for throwing shade at him over performance in \'The Match\'  Tom Brady and Josh Allen were one half of \'The Match\' tournament that took place a couple of weeks ago. The golfing event pitted Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers against Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen.  Prior to the event, all four players exchanged jibes towards the opposing team, with the seven-time Super Bowl champ and Allen the most prominent. Now weeks removed from the golfing event, the pair are still at it. Allen was a guest on Will Compton\'s podcast Bussin With the Boys and was asked to rate every player\'s golfing skills.        Allen picked Rodgers as the best, followed by Mahomes, himself, and had Brady way down at the bottom of the list, seemingly in a joking fashion. Nonetheless, the GOAT responded in the best way possible, going after Allen\'s record against him.

Brady and Buccaneers to look different in 2022/23 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Mandatory Minicamp The Buccaneers will have a different look this upcoming season. Bruce Arians is no longer the head coach and was replaced by the defensive-minded Todd Bowles. The Tampa Bay offense will be without Rob Gronkowski, who announced his second retirement yesterday. Receiver Chris Godwin, still rehabbing his torn ACL, will likely miss a decent chunk of the season.        That leaves Mike Evans, Russell Gage, Scott Miller, Cameron Brate, Breshad Perriman, and running backs Leonard Fournette and Giovani Bernard to carry the load. With the NFC South essentially theirs for the taking, the Buccaneers are favored to win the division yet again. However, without Gronkowski and Godwin, their true challenge may arise during the playoffs.   They will have a different look, but expect the Buccaneers to be right in the thick of this season\'s Super Bowl conversation. They\'re still a strong pack and this year they\'ll have the addition of a terrific leader in Todd Bowles.     ', 'Tom Brady addresses Josh Allen\'s Wild Card showing  Tom Brady\'s AFC East dynasty has ended, but another has swiftly risen to take its place.  The arguable ""GOAT"" has crossed conferences, but has stayed up to date on his former AFC stomping grounds as the NFL playoffs rage on. His former comrades in New England, making their first postseason appearance since his departure after the 2019-20 season, were swiftly eliminated in a 47-17 shellacking at the hands of the Buffalo Bills in Saturday night\'s portion of the NFL\'s Wild Card playoff proceedings. Western New York has taken each of the first two AFC East titles since No. 12 moved to earn another championship with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.        Speaking with podcast co-host Jim Gray, Brady was impressed with the way Allen performed in the freezing conditions Highmark Stadium had to offer on Saturday night. The quarterback earned five touchdown passes and tallied 374 total yards, including 66 rushing.           “Josh Allen played spectacular football in zero-degree weather and was throwing the football extremely well,"" Brady said.  ""They have a lot of talented skill players. Buffalo was pretty unstoppable that night,"" the famed quarterback told co-host Jim Gray. “Playing in Buffalo, I know how tough it is to play up there. Myself, personally, playing up there found success, obviously, but at the same time they were always challenging games and when those guys get going, man, it’s tough."" Buffalo had a touchdown on all but one of its offensive possessions, the lone exception coming through game-ending kneeldowns. By then, Allen had been lifted for backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky.     Brady was particularly impressed with Allen\'s first score of the night. At the end of Buffalo\'s first possession, Allen fought off a feisty New England pass rush to find tight end Dawson Knox for a leaping, eight-yard score that gave Buffalo a permanent lead and sent Orchard Park into hysterics.

You think you’re throwing a ball out of the back of the end zone to conserve a field goal, next thing you know your tight end is catching in the end zone for a big way to start the game. It was one of those nights where Buffalo’s offense was almost impossible to stop.”     Tom Brady knows a thing... or 33... about succeeding in Buffalo The possibility of a Super Bowl headlined by the Brady-Allen matchup remains in play.

The Cowboys were held to just three points and were the only team in Week 1 not to score a touchdown.  Prescott looked like a quarterback who had not played any proper football for months, and it showed as he completed 14 of his 29 passes for 134 yards and an interception. Bayless was not happy with what he saw from the Cowboys signal-caller and slammed him for his performance on Undisputed.        “Did I overestimate the fourth-round pick? Who plays occasionally like he’s the fourth-overall pick, but too often he plays like a fourth-round pick. The other night, he played like a seventh-round pick to me.""              “Dak stunk it up and its why I can’t get all bent out of shape for losing Dak Prescott. I have been up and down on him since he was drafted in the fourth-round.”     After Prescott\'s injury that will see him sidelined for at least four weeks, back-up Cooper Rush will be tasked with keeping the Cowboys\' season alive until No. 4 returns.  Dak Prescott struggles in Cowboys\' season opener Dak Prescott (under helmet) during the Cowboys\' season-opening game It was hard on the eyes and even harder for Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night. The Tampa Bay defense, led by Todd Bowles, made life very difficult for the Cowboys offense.        The game started brightly for Dallas as they drove down the field and scored what would be their only points of the game. After that, it was tough sledding for Dallas as their receivers simply could not get open. Prescott often forced the ball into tight coverage and was lucky not to be picked off more than once. The Buccaneers held Dallas to 3/15 on third down as the offense could not move the ball at all and kept the home side to 2/5 on fourth down. They also kept the Cowboys offense to just 3.8 yards per play.

In the last three weeks, he has faced Gardner Minshew, Joshua Dobbs, and Sam Howell. Gardner Minshew is the backup quarterback to Jalen Hurts for the Philadelphia Eagles. Joshua Dobbs was playing his first game for the Tennessee Titans after signing from the Detroit Lions\' practice squad. Sam Howell is the third-choice quarterback for the Commanders behind Carson Wentz and Taylor Heinicke.     Each of these should have been blowout wins. Instead, they now go into the postseason severely bloodied and winded. They are looking to win their first Super Bowl of the millennium and Prescott\'s performance today does not give much hope. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are a 8-9 team with a losing record and the Cowboys should be favorites. But they still have Tom Brady and the Dallas Cowboys are as weak as they could be in the quarterback position.It was the worst possible outcome to their final regular season game. They will hope that it will not have any bearing on the playoffs. They have flattered to deceive in the postseason previously, and they will now be hoping their luck flips.

When Jimmy Johnson was coach of the Dallas Cowboys in the 1990s, they won back-to-back Super Bowl titles and many considered his teams as the team of the 90s. Johnson\'s quarterback during that run was Fox NFL analyst and NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman. The Aikman and Jimmy Johnson combination was fierce. Ironically, the only team that ever challenged the Cowboys and kept them from winning three straight titles were the San Fransicio 49ers who were led by Steve Young. Jimmy Johnson and Aikman\'s relationship worked well because they both wanted the same thing and went about getting what they wanted the same way. Johnson was tough on his players and many wondered after the Cowboys\' loss on Sunday what his response would have been after this loss. Johnson would cut players for making those kinds of mistakes in football games. But his wasn\'t the only voice that was critical of the Cowboys on Sunday.

After back-up Cooper Rush managed to secure a crucial win over the Vikings last week in Prescott\'s absence, the Cowboys\' No. 4 was back under center.  Dallas was a double-digit favorite as they welcomed the 4-4 Denver Broncos and many expected them to rack up points, as they have done all season.        From the get-go, it was evident that Dak Prescott and the Cowboys just were not at the races. Missed passes from Prescott, dropped passes from receivers and the defense\'s inability to stop anything the Broncos did on offense was hard to watch.           While the Broncos only mustered two sacks (both to Jonathon Cooper), Prescott was under duress for the majority of the game and his quarterback play mirrored a player who was under constant pressure. Bayless not pleased with Prescott\'s for poor showing Dak\'s poor play did not escape the eye of Fox Sports\' Undisputed co-host Skip Bayless.

Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys fell to the San Francisco 49ers in a frustrating 19-12 loss in the Divisional Round of the NFC playoffs. After a dominant win in the Wild Card round, this playoff run will be chalked up to a missed opportunity - much like the previous ones.  Since Prescott came into the league and took over as the starter, the Cowboys have been a contender. Unfortunately, they come up short all too often now.        The loss puts Prescott's career playoff record at 2-4. His overall stats aren't bad in the postseason, but he's certainly had a few highs and a few lows. Sunday's loss was definitely a low.              Prescott only mustered up 206 yards and two interceptions (to just one touchdown) against a 49ers defense that doesn't boast an elite secondary. He was sacked just once, so much of the problem was self-inflicted. The Cowboys just couldn't generate much offense and when they could, they often shot themselves in the foot. This very well may be Prescott's worst playoff performance of his entire career.      Bad performances that have become commonplace for Dak Prescott That's not to say that Dak Prescott hasn't been good in the playoffs before. Just the week before, he threw four touchdowns in a dominant effort over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In his first playoff game, which ended up being a loss, Prescott threw for 302 yards and three touchdowns.    On the other hand, last year's playoff exit saw him complete just 54% of his passes and throw one touchdown and one interception.     Out of the four losses he's now suffered in the postseason, this loss to the 49ers stands out. For all the flak Prescott gets from Cowboys fans and the media, he's usually a very strong quarterback. Dak Prescott couldn't get the offense going A lot of the turnovers he had this season weren't entirely his fault. Sunday's loss might have been. The two interceptions, one of which came in the red zone late in the first half and led to a field goal for San Francisco, were blatantly poor decisions.If the Cowboys are to get over the hump, Dak Prescott will need to be a little sharper in games like this.

So I\'m hoping you got one of those special teams this year.           However, Skip Bayless interpreted Parsons\' comment as a subtle jab at his quarterback, Dak Prescott. He drew a parallel to Trent Dilfer, the Ravens\' quarterback in 2000, who wasn\'t considered exceptional but still won a Super Bowl ring with the help of his dominant defense. Skip: All right, so the problem with this statement is that Micah took an unintentional shot at his quarterback because he\'s basically saying ""who cares what our quarterback does, because the other team can\'t score anyway."" So he is sort of equating Dak to Trent Dilfer, who became your quarterback. It wasn\'t always bad that year, no - he went seven and one in his starts.     Is Dak Prescott a bad quarterback? Will the Cowboys re-sign him? Prescott is entering the third season on a four-year, $160 contract he signed before the 2021 season. He has a base salary of $31 million for 2023 while holding a cap hit of $49.1 million, which is the highest on the Cowboys\' roster and the third-highest in the entire league for 2023. Back in February, Jones\' stance was clear. ""We\'ve got to have a plan to ultimately extend Dak,"" Stephen Jones said. While some fans may have concerns about Dak Prescott\'s performance, it\'s important to recognize that he is a talented quarterback. It is possible to critique Prescott\'s performance while still acknowledging his overall skill and contribution. Comparing Prescott to Dilfer, who was not considered an outstanding quarterback, is seen as unfair and an insult to Prescott\'s abilities. Although Dilfer has a Super Bowl ring to his name, his overall career is not highly regarded. Therefore, the comparison does not accurately represent Prescott\'s talent.     Why is Micah Parsons changing positions?Parsons was a hybrid linebacker and EDGE for the past two seasons, but as he\'s becoming a full pass rusher for the Cowboys, he\'s going to have more opportunities to make an impact in games.

Dak Prescott was once again unavailable to play for the Dallas Cowboys against the Philadelphia Eagles due to this thumb injury.  And, as fate would have it, backup quarterback Cooper Rush, who was on a five-game winning streak as the Cowboys\' starting quarterback, finally lost a game.        The Philadelphia Eagles won the game 26-20 in Week 6 and Rush had arguably the most dire performance of his career.           After all the hype about ""Super Rush"" from various analysts and endless debates about how he\'s seemingly an upgrade over Prescott, Cooper Rush threw three interceptions in what might have been his last start of the season.

', ""Was Matthew Stafford’s Super Bowl win legit? Rams’ stark downfall raises questions after fruitful season  Matthew Stafford will miss this week's game against the Kansas City Chiefs due to a neck injury, according to the Los Angeles Rams. It's a good thing because he hasn't helped his case when he's been on the field. This season, he has thrown 10 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. His quarterback rating is 87.4, which is a significant drop from his fortunes last season.  Last season, he had 41 touchdowns and 17 interceptions, and a quarterback rating of 102.9. He's on pace for his worst season since 2014. This has prompted speculation about whether his Super Bowl victory last year was a fluke. People naturally think that exceptional play by Cooper Kupp, brilliance from Odell Beckham Jr., and a defense anchored by Aaron Donald and Von Miller was the reason he lifted the Lombardi Trophy.        There is a grain of truth to that side of the story. Losing players with the capability of Von Miller and Odell Beckham Jr. will affect any team negatively. Cooper Kupp has maintained his standards this season, but he is also now out injured along with Matthew Stafford. So, there has been a combination of factors that have led to the Los Angeles Rams being historically bad. But does such a performance wipe away the legitimacy of Matthew Stafford's Super Bowl win?           Sportskeeda Pro Football@SKProFootballThe Rams championship hangover has reached historic levels...   (via @NFLonFOX)#NFL #RamsHouse #HereWeGo7The Rams championship hangover has reached historic levels... 😬 🐏 (via @NFLonFOX)#NFL #RamsHouse #HereWeGo https://t.co/9XpYt6A13Z     Matthew Stafford's Super Bowl win will always remain with him As always in football reporting, the pendulum seems to swing towards extremes and not moderation. When Matthew Stafford won the Super Bowl, there was an immediate clamor in some quarters to call him a surefire future Hall-of-Famer. Now that the Rams are losing, he has been branded a fraud in many quarters. The truth is, as always, somewhere in the middle. We have enumerated his stats in the past, but the one place where he has not dipped this season is his completion percentage. His completion percentage last season was 67.2 percent and this year it inches upwards to 68 percent. Extrapolated over a season, he is also expected to have lesser interceptions than last year. However, touchdown passes and yards have both decreased in the last year. This is a cause for concern because passing attempts per game and completions have not decreased significantly. This suggests that yards per play are decreasing.     So, if we just look at the offense, the problem isn't so much that Matthew Stafford isn't playing well as it is that receivers aren't getting open downfield as much as they did last year. As a result, the quarterback's output has decreased. In addition, he has been sacked 29 times in nine games this season, compared to 30 in all of last season. The offensive line is also not performing as well as it should.

His wife, Kelly, said she was in awe of James after he spoke to the couple.  Kelly Stafford in awe of LeBron James        Kelly talked about the interaction during Tuesday’s episode of her podcast, “The Morning After with Kelly Stafford,” saying:      “The fact that LeBron took a second and even said anything to me I thought was very classy, kind and all things.” A viral video shows James talking to the Staffords about having to play great with Matthew Stafford in the building.

He finished with 56 points and 10 rebounds, shooting 19 of 31, including 6 of 11 from 3-point range, and 12 of 13 from the free-throw line.     James became the fourth-oldest player in NBA history to top 50 points and the oldest to ever have a 50-point double-double. Kelly Stafford said: “The show that LeBron put on, it doesn’t get any better.” It makes sense that Kelly Stafford was in awe of James speaking to her after such a game. Most people would be in awe after seeing the performance, let alone speaking with him. Moreso, she heard him praise her husband\'s greatness as an NFL player and Super Bowl champion for the LA Rams. What made the biggest difference for Kelly, though, was, as she mentioned, the fact that James even spoke to her. After seeing such greatness unfold, only to see the man come over and talk to her and her husband must have been an exuberant experience. Kelly explained how excited she was: “It’s been on my bucket list to sit courtside at a Lakers game since I made a bucket list … I feel like I was numb the entire time.”     Luckily for the Stafford family, James and company were able to secure victory and stay in high spirits. The (28-36) Lakers have run into trouble all season. The squad has been dealing with injuries and chemistry issues and has yet to gain traction. But if James manages to get his foot in the playoffs, anything can happen. Kelly Stafford\'s appreciation for James is founded on her passion for the game itself. During the episode, she said: “I grew up playing basketball. Basketball has always been a big part of my life.” The entire experience must have been incredible, as it would for any Lakers fan. Getting a much-needed win, scoring a season high and setting two NBA records makes for a great night regardless of who\'s in the building.James will hope to keep the momentum going as the Lakers have the toughest part of their schedule still remaining. Teetering on the edge of the play-in tournament, the Lakers are going to need something to keep their spirits high. If only the LA Rams could take turns sitting courtside.

In a game against the Browns early in his career, the quarterback took a hit late that left him down on the turf.        However, he returned to the game to throw one more pass near the goalline to win the game.

52,Mitchell Trubisky,"[""3 observations from QB Mitchell Trubiksy's gritty display against Chicago Bears in NFL preseason  Buffalo Bills QB Mitchell Trubiksy, a first-round pick in 2017, returned to Chicago for the first time since the Chicago Bears released him.  NFL fans were excited to see Mitchell Trubiuksy's 'revenge' game as he would see a ton of action in this Week 2 NFL preseason game. Pre-game, Mitchell Trubiksy and 2021 first-round pick QB Justin Fields greeted each other with open arms and no ill will.        Soldier Field welcomed Mitchell Trubiksy with mostly cheers. He played in seven series over two quarters, and led the Bills to 34 points in a 41-15 win. Here are three observations from Mitchell Trubisky's performance against his former team.            #1 The Chicago Bears front office and coaching staff dropped the ball on Mitchell Trubiksy Lowest % of accurate passes this season:30. Dwayne Haskins: 50.4% (benched)31. Mitchell Trubisky: 46.2% (benched)32. Carson Wentz: 42.8% pic.twitter.com/V9654uVnbD— PFF (@PFF) October 7, 2020 Mitchell Trubisky was likely drafted way too soon as the second overall pick in 2017, but could still have gone in the first round. The Bears put him in as the starter four games into his rookie year, going 4-8 with seven TDs and seven INTs.     In his second year, new head coach Matt Nagy and GM Ryan Pace were going to build around Mitchell Trubiksy. He got the Bears to the playoffs, but they lost in the wildcard round. For the season, he had 3,223 passing yards, 24 TDs and 12 INTs. In 2019, Chicago missed the playoffs, and Mitchell Trubiksy had 3,138 passing yards, 17 TDs and ten INTs. In 2020, QB Nick Foles was acquired in a trade for competition. Mitchell Trubiksy was benched during the season and only played in ten games for 2,055 passing yards, 16 TDs and eight INTs. Three OCs in four years is also never good for a young QB, and neither is constant QB changes, in a way. It rocks their confidence and mental state. His completion percentage got better as his career went on, as he had fewer INTs as well. Another example of the Bears mishandling Trubiksy and playing him too early was him going 20-of-28 for 221 yards and a TD while commanding the offense masterfully against them.      #2 Mitchell Trubiksy is building a case for a second chance with new-found confidence Dual-threat QB Mitchell Trubisky with **checks notes** 4 TDs tonight pic.twitter.com/AVEZ0FjG0Q— Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) December 6, 2019 With OC Brian Daboll's playcalling and schemes, Mitchell Trubiksy was able to showcase his best performance in years. It's still just the preseason, but it's a huge positive for the QB. He never looked calm in the pocket in 2020 with Chicago, but he was cool and collected against most of the Bears' starters.     The accuracy was there, but Mitchell Trubiksy still lacked true deep-ball skills. Being able to score 34 points on seven drives with just one punt is an impressive feat, though. He's already looking like a top-10 backup QB in the NFL, and the Bills should try to keep him around long term.  #3 Chicago weren't the best team for Mitchell Trubisky, and he is a QB who needs the right system to succeed From @gmfb: Former #Bears QB Mitchell Trubisky is assessing his options, looking for the right fit and a scheme that can suit his skill set. pic.twitter.com/2Mw6uf1NrY— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) March 17, 2021     Part of Mitchell Trubiksy's success against Chicago was OC Brian Daboll's genius playcalling. With HC Matt Nagy and a variety of OCs, they never called good plays that reflected Trubiksy's skill set well. He was top 20 in air yards in 2019, which was too high for someone who struggles downfield. Matt Nagy is also an inferior play-caller to Daboll, so Mitchell Trubiksy is reaping the benefits. The Bills are one of the top rising Super Bowl contenders, giving Trubiksy a great offense to work with.The Pittsburgh Steelers, Las Vegas Raiders and Philadelphia Eagles could come knocking at the end of the season if the player continues to improve.Also Check Out: Complete Chicago Bears NFL Preseason Schedule 2021     "", 'Ben Roethlisberger didn\'t like Steelers fans booing Mitchell Trubisky.\xa0  Legendary Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired at the end of last season. He was the quarterback for the Steelers from 2004 until then. Following his retirement, the Steelers brought in former Chicago Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and also drafted Kenny Pickett. Trubisky was given the nod ahead of rookie Pickett to start the season as the starting quarterback for the franchise.  The Steelers won their opening game against the Cincinnati Bengals with Trubisky under center. However, the offense was not inspiring and then the Week 2 loss against the New England Patriots was very disappointing. The Steelers fans present at the stadium booed quarterback Trubisky and gave an indication that they already want local boy Kenny Pickett as the team\'s quarterback.

He condemned them and hopes for better treatment from them for the quarterback. Here\'s what Roethlisberger had to say about the situation: ""I don\'t think it is fair that it happened to Mitch because I wouldn\'t blame Mitch for the performance. I don\'t think that he deserved the fans getting on him. I hate it for Mitch because I don\'t think it\'s fair.""

I don\'t think that he deserved the fans getting on him (Sunday). I hate it for Mitch because I don\'t think it\'s fair."" Trubisky is expected to start for Pittsburgh going forward. However, if his performances don\'t improve, we will see Pickett making his NFL debut sooner rather than later.          Are the Pittsburgh Steelers a better team without Ben Roethlisberger? New England Patriots v Pittsburgh Steelers Ben Roethlisberger is an NFL legend, having led the Steelers to two Super Bowl victories. But in recent years, as he aged, his performances declined, and the Steelers slowed down to a degree. With two much younger quarterbacks in the form of Mitchell Trubisky and Kenny Pickett, the Steelers\' offense has a new dynamism. When necessary, they can run the ball with their quarterback. With a mobile quarterback, coach Mike Tomlin can work wonders, just as he did in Roethlisberger\'s early years.     A lot of Steelers fans think the playcalling has to change. They are frustrated with the lack of innovation and passes thrown down the field. Offensive coordinator Matt Canada may have to be more aggressive to give Pittsburgh a better chance at winning.    It\'s unclear at this point whether Trubisky or Pickett is the Steelers\' long-term solution at quarterback. The current Steelers roster is on par or slightly better than last year\'s, giving them another shot at a Wild Card berth in the playoffs.     It will be interesting to see who ends the season as the Steelers quarterback. The pressure is mounting on Trubisky with Pickett waiting for his chance.If you use any quotes, please credit the Footbahlin podcast and H/T Sportskeeda     ', ""Kenny Pickett's performance proves Steelers have a potential answer but not solution for Ben Roethlisberger's replacement  Kenny Pickett was selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was the organization's choice to take over as their future franchise quarterback following the retirement of Ben Roethlisberger during the 2022 NFL offseason. Roethlisberger retired after spending his entire 18 year career with the Steelers.  While Pickett would be tasked with filling big shoes, he didn't open the season as the starting quarterback. Instead, the Steelers named Mitchell Trubisky the Week 1 starter after signing him during the 2022 free agency period.        Trubisky struggled in his short time as the starting quarterback for the Steelers, losing two of his first three games. He entered a favorable match-up at home in Week 4 against the New York Jets, but failed to impress. By the end of the first half, the Steelers were trailing by a 10-6 score. This triggered head coach Mike Tomlin to make a change, bringing in rookie Kenny Pickett to replace Trubisky.           Pickett's NFL career got off to the roughest of starts as he threw an interception on his very first passing attempt ever. He would go on to complete ten of his 13 passing attempts for 120 yards, but all three of his incompletions were intercepted by the Jets defense. On a more positive note, Pickett recorded two rushing touchdowns. Dov Kleiman@NFL_DovKleimanThat was quick... Kenny Pickett throws an INT on his first drive in the NFL Was his first pass in the NFL.38362That was quick... Kenny Pickett throws an INT on his first drive in the NFL Was his first pass in the NFL.https://t.co/Sxvi9vsWsy     It was a mixed performance for Pickett, who failed to complete the comeback against the Jets. Instead, the Steelers lost their third consecutive game. While it was only one half, Pickett will need to play much better moving forward. Especially if he's going to follow in Ben Roethlisberger's footsteps, which include two Super Bowl rings.     It's unclear at this point if Kenny Pickett will be named the starting quarterback moving forward or if the Steelers will give Trubisky another shot first, but an announcement by Mike Tomlin can be expected sometime prior to the Week 5 game. It will be a tough task for whoever gets named the starter, facing off against the Buffalo Bills, one of the best teams in the NFL with the top-ranked defense from a season ago.     Which teams passed on Kenny Pickett? Pittsburgh QB Kenny Pickett Pickett was the only quarterback selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft, going to the Steelers with the 20th overall pick. Several teams ahead of the Steelers in the draft order were rumored to be interested in drafting a quarterback in the first round, but ultimately decided to pass on Pickett.         The Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, and Seattle Seahawks all decided to pass on quarterbacks, filling other roster needs instead. Other teams that passed on Pickett in the first round drafted quarterbacks later. These were the Atlanta Falcons (Desmond Ridder), the Carolina Panthers (Matt Corral), and the Washington Commanders (Sam Howell). The Tennessee Titans also decided to take a quarterback later in the draft when Malik Willis fell to them in the third round. They weren't necessarily in the market for one, so didn't really pass on Pickett, but capitalized on drafting Willis for value where they got him. The New England Patriots similarly drafted Bailey Zappe in the fourth round, before a trio of speculative quarterbacks were selected late in the seventh round. Does Kenny Pickett really have small hands? Kenny Pickett at the 2022 NFL Combine     Kenny Pickett's hands measured in at just 8.5 inches during the 2022 NFL Combine. He officially has the smallest hands of any quarterback currently playing in the NFL, making his grip on the football a potential issue moving forward. While his hands are extremely small compared to other NFL quarterbacks, it's debatable how much of an impact that really has on a player's abilities. It's certain that the Steelers would have drafted him if they had any concerns about this. They scouted him thoroughly and would have watched endless tape of his college days before reaching a decision.It was great to see the rookie get on the field, although his debut didn't quite go to plan. We will see him develop and perhaps start some games in the near future.     "", ""NFL Rumor: Mitchell Trubisky will not return to the Bears in 2021  Chicago Bears' QB Mitchell Trubisky has had his ups and downs since being drafted by the team in 2017. But now it seems like the Bears will not look towards resigning Trubisky, unless they make a significant push into the playoffs.  In the 2020 off-season, the Bears had declined the fifth-year option on Trubisky's rookie contract. In retrospect, this move typically occurs when a team chooses not to give them an extension.        On the other hand, however, it could also mean that the Bears would like to give him a contract that wouldn't give Trubisky as much money as his fifth-year option did.           Kids are leaving the game today as die-hard Mitch Trubisky fans pic.twitter.com/E5OlUbg1il— PFF (@PFF) January 10, 2021 Had the Bears taken the option, Trubisky would have made around $24.8 million in 2021. Considering the way he has been playing and was benched in Week 3 for Nick Foles, the option certainly wouldn't have been worth it. Foles got the starting job in Week 4 and went 2-5 as the starter. Eventually, Trubisky was brought back in and was surprisingly able to lead the Bears on a three-game win streak, eventually giving them a playoff spot.     Also check out: Complete 2018 NFL Draft Results  Is Trubisky the future for the Bears or another team? There's no question why the Bears' organization declined the fifth-year option for Trubisky, as he simply has not been accurate in terms of performance. Trubisky's best year came in 2018, which was statistically the best season of his career under then new head coach Matt Nagy. Since then, Trubisky has been on the downfall, with both his completion percentage and touchdown/interception ratio. His 2020 regular season campaign looked very similar to his rookie season and this could be due to Nagy's play calling.

Nagy wished Trubisky nothing but the best, but Chicago will do everything it can to stop their former quarterback once the game starts. With Josh Allen out, Mitch Trubisky will start for the Bills Saturday against Chicago.A message from @TarikCohen ahead of time. pic.twitter.com/zjQbliJ6WD— B/R Gridiron (@brgridiron) August 20, 2021     Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott announced that franchise quarterback Josh Allen would not see time against Chicago. Several Bills starters will sit out Week 2. All eyes will be on Mitchell Trubisky on Saturday. Chicago Bears head coach Matt Nagy told reporters that Andy Dalton would start against the Bills. Nagy also mentioned that Dalton would see a considerable amount of time. With Justin Fields being questionable, it could be an Andy Dalton-Nick Foles show Saturday afternoon.

As of right now, the gap between Andy Dalton and Justin Fields is head coach Matt Nagy. If Dalton leads a couple of touchdown drives against Buffalo, that could be enough to secure him as the Week 1 starter in Chicago.  Buffalo Bills at Chicago Bears: Prediction The Buffalo Bills will get their best performance out of Mitchell Trubisky on Saturday. It's likely the Bears fan base will greet him loudly as he trots on the field. That will carry the Bills through the first half of the game.Prediction: Chicago will push back in the second half and defeat the Bills to remain undefeated in the 2021-22 NFL preseason.Also Check Out: Complete Chicago Bears NFL Preseason Schedule 2021     "", 'Steelers\' QB starting competition - Mike Tomlin\xa0  The Pittsburgh Steelers got their man in the draft when they were able to land Kenny Pickett with the no. 20 overall pick in the first round last week.

Mitchell Trubisky, Kenny Pickett and Mason Rudolph to compete for Steelers QB position Detroit Lions v Pittsburgh Steelers     For the first time in years, there\'s a quarterback competition in Pittsburgh. For the last 18 years, Ben Roethlisberger was the franchise quarterback, but he retired at the end of the 2021 season. With he retired, the Steelers added Mitchell Trubisky in the offseason.    Pittsburgh signed Trubsiky to a 2-year $14.25 million contract. They also added quarterback Kenny Pickett in the draft. Mason Rudolph was already on their roster as a backup to Roethlisberger The Steelers finished the season 9-7-1, squeezing into the playoffs thanks to a remarkable sequence of events. They beat the Baltimore Ravens 16-13 in overtime, the Indianapolis Colts lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars and then a last-second overtime field goal prevented a tie between the Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Chargers.     The Wild Card round proved to be a humbling 21-42 defeat at the hands of the Kansas City Chiefs, eradicating any hopes of a third Roethlisberger Super Bowl win.Heading into the season, coach Tomlin has made it clear that the best man will win the quarterback job. Each quarterback will have to show that they\'re the best man to lead the Steelers this season.

The Steelers are now 1-2, and so far, haven\'t seen their quarterback produce moments of brilliance.  With rookie quarterback Kenny Pickett eagerly waiting for his chance, many have already started asking Mike Tomlin to start Pickett instead of Trubisky. Tomlin, however, has denied benching Mitch Trubisky as yet.

On his show, The Herd with Colin Cowherd, he talked about why Trubisky hasn\'t been good and why the Steelers need to make a change quickly. Here\'s what Cowherd said about the Steelers: “What used to be really, really admirable, very, very redeemable, almost charming about the Steelers was their patience, their loyalty. I think it\'s getting in the way [now]. I think patience and loyalty are now their weaknesses.     ""If you take out that George Pickens catch, the catch of the year in the NFL for the record, not a well-thrown ball that is the catch of the year, maybe the decade in the NFL 36 yards.    “That was Trubisky\'s best performance of the year. His tight end, that kid\'s great from Penn State. You didn\'t see him till the end of the game. Chase Claypool disappeared, Pickens had to make the catch of the year. Mitch Trubisky all year long has completed six passes downfield, 20 yards downfield all season.”     Colin Cowherd concluded by saying: “Mike Tomlin is a very good coach, [but] is sticking with Trubisky and we can all see it. It took the catch of the year and prevent defense for Trubisky to get into the hundred-yard category with no touchdowns…” GhettoGronk@TheGhettoGronk“Please bench Trubisky and start Kenny Pickett”Mike Tomlin:44949“Please bench Trubisky and start Kenny Pickett”Mike Tomlin: https://t.co/SoUW3Tt4Xu The clock is ticking for Mitch Trubisky, as the Steelers fans have already shown that they are eagerly waiting for local boy Kenny Pickett to take over the team.

Mitch Trubisky will be under immense pressure to produce a good performance and lead his team to a win against the Jets.     If he isn\'t able to get a win in the next game, then the situation will become very tough for Trubisky.

He will be hoping to impress his way back into the NFL.  Ian Rapoport@RapSheetFrom today’s wire: Colin Kaepernick will throw in front of NFL scouts during Michigan’s spring game.2:00 AM · Apr 2, 20225525431From today’s wire: Colin Kaepernick will throw in front of NFL scouts during Michigan’s spring game. https://t.co/EFxrziqPcI        Given his previous record in the league, when he appeared in one NFC Championship game and one Super Bowl, he could very well give some potential starters some cause for worry. Here are three current NFL starting quarterbacks who could be replaced by Colin Kaepernick.           Colin Kaepernick will cause these QBs to look over their shoulders #1 - Sam Darnold, Carolina Panthers Sam Darnold is the starting quarterback for the Carolina Panthers but knows from experience from last season that it counts for nothing if the performances on the field are not good. His standing last season deteriorated to a point where the Panthers brought back Cam Newton to replace him as a starter and stop the slide. That Newton played worse than him worked in his favor, but he cannot depend on it all the time. A rejuvenated Colin Kaepernick could spell serious trouble for him.     #2 - Mitchell Trubisky, Pittsburgh Steelers Mitchell Trubisky gets another chance to be the starting quarterback following his departure from Chicago, with him having spent a year as a backup with the Buffalo Bills. The Steelers are starting life without Ben Roethlisberger, and it is bound to be a tough transition. For a franchise that is used to winning, Mitchell Trubisky might not be the most comfortable option to start with, with his yardage and touchdowns decreasing each year since 2018. A good performance by Kaepernick in his drills might convince the Steelers to let him supplant Trubisky.

Appreciate the warm welcome @UMichFootball @UMich https://t.co/Z0guUNlYw3     #3 - Jameis Winston, New Orleans Saints Jameis Winston was not shabby for the New Orleans Saints last season and had a passer rating of 102.8 when his season ended prematurely. But there is a reason why he was jettisoned and Tom Brady brought in by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He gives up an inordinate amount of interceptions for a starting quarterback. He led the league in interceptions in 2019 with 30 interceptions and set the record for interceptions returned for a touchdown that season, too, with seven. That season, he had to play under a new coach as Bruce Arians replaced Dirk Koetter, and this season will also be similar for him with the New Orleans Saints beginning life after Sean Payton under Dennis Allen.To put it into perspective, Kaepernick has a total of 30 interceptions in his entire NFL career. He was brought in as a backup to the New Orleans Saints behind Drew Brees, and there is a chance he might revert to the same role if Colin Kaepernick is available.     "", '5 NFL trades that could be a game-changer in 2022 season feat. Mitchell Trubisky  Mitchell Trubisky and fans everywhere have had their first big bite of the 2022-23 NFL season. After two games, fans and pundits have their earliest indications of what teams could be destined for greatness, while others brace for the worst.  By midseason, the greats, the almosts, and those preparing for 2023 will be engaging in trade talks with star players.        Fortunes could be flipped on their heads as one player ditches one jersey for another. Here are five trades that could change the fate of teams across the league this season.           #1 New England Patriots trade Jonnu Smith and a second-round pick to Philadelphia Eagles for Quez Watkins NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Philadelphia Eagles v Tampa Bay Buccaneers The Patriots could be hovering around .500 as the trade deadline approaches. One aspect of the team that is missing is a deep-threat option. They have plenty of possession receivers who can run routes as well as anyone. They, however, do not have anyone who can take the top off the defense like Quez Watkins.      Jonnu Smith has lost the starting job to Hunter Henry and could be seen as trade bait for the right team. Zack Cox@ZackCoxNESNPatriots also ran behind Strange on almost every play of their game-clinching drive. Big performance by the rookie. twitter.com/BenFennell_NFL…Ben Fennell@BenFennell_NFLSo so impressed with Pats rookie Cole Strange today… Some big boy 1-on-1 reps vs Cam Heyward104573So so impressed with Pats rookie Cole Strange today… Some big boy 1-on-1 reps vs Cam Heyward https://t.co/4AjFrupT8iPatriots also ran behind Strange on almost every play of their game-clinching drive. Big performance by the rookie. twitter.com/BenFennell_NFL… The Eagles are not locked in with their current tight end room. Dallas Goedert leads the room, and several unknowns sit behind him. Of course, a deep threat receiver costs a premium, which is why a second-round pick would be necessary. The Patriots have sold out in free agency before, so a jump to the trade block wouldn\'t be too big of a leap.     #2 Green Bay Packers trade Jordan Love and a second-round pick to Washington Commanders for Terry McLaurin Washington Football Team v New York Giants The Jordan Love experiment effectively ended after Aaron Rodgers signed his new deal. Meanwhile, the Commanders could quickly cool on Carson Wentz, who lasted just one year in Indianapolis. Adding Love to the roster would help the Commanders considerably as a last-ditch effort to save 2022 and set themselves up well for 2023.     Scott Grodsky@ScottGrodsky#Packers QB Jordan Love (@jordan3love) released a hype video ahead of training camp this week.1313111#Packers QB Jordan Love (@jordan3love) released a hype video ahead of training camp this week. https://t.co/9wswjFmO4R Love is still a relatively untested player in the NFL, so the Commanders could jump at the chance for another de facto quality rookie. Meanwhile, it is no secret that the Packers need weapons out wide. Adding Terry McLaurin, who is a 1,000-yard machine in his time in the league, could satiate Rodgers and return the Packers to the class of the NFC. #3 Dallas Cowboys trade third-round pick to Pittsburgh Steelers for Mitchell Trubisky     New England Patriots v Pittsburgh Steelers Cooper Rush may have just upset the Cincinnati Bengals, but there is still a long way to go. Dak Prescott could still miss another seven games or so. Rush simply isn\'t the solution at backup quarterback for the Cowboys over the long haul. Mitchell Trubisky, meanwhile, could be the solution. Andrew Fillipponi@ThePoniExpressOur NFL insider @ProFootballTalk on @937theFan on benching Mitch Trubisky for Kenny Pickett: ""You have to give the people what they want at some point.""26018Our NFL insider @ProFootballTalk on @937theFan on benching Mitch Trubisky for Kenny Pickett: ""You have to give the people what they want at some point.""     With the team receiving praise for their defense, specifically Micah Parsons, there is a tried-and-true formula to winning with Trubisky. Trubisky went 12-4 and made the playoffs twice with a great defense when he was with the Bears. He was also a backup quarterback last season.    With Prescott\'s injury issues becoming apparent, it is clear the team needs a premium at the backup quarterback spot. Trubisky could be that guy. Put simply, the trade makes sense on a number of levels.     #4 Seattle Seahawks trade Geno Smith and a fifth-round pick to Pittsburgh Steelers for Mitchell Trubisky Los Angeles Rams v Seattle Seahawks Geno Smith may have started hot against the Denver Broncos on Monday Night Football, but the Seahawks have been effectively shut down since the end of the first half of that game. The preseason made it clear that Drew Lock is not the solution. However, Mitchell Trubisky could come for free with the right offer.        The Steelers don\'t need a quarterback controversy between Trubisky and Pickett once the rookie eventually takes over, so a trade makes sense to keep order. Meanwhile, the Seahawks aim to run the ball, play defense, and win without asking the quarterback to do too much. That is effectively what the Steelers quarterback has made a career of doing. The trade makes sense for both sides. #5 Tennessee Titans trade Derrick Henry to Las Vegas Raiders for Davante Adams     Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Tennessee Titans This could turn the division race on its head. Rumors swirled that Josh Jacobs was on his way out after he played late into the preseason while other starters sat. Meanwhile, the Titans elected to lean on their running game when they chose to trade AJ Brown to the Eagles during the NFL Draft.   Now at 0-2, both teams could be questioning their philosophy. Swapping one of the best wide receivers in the NFL for one of the best running backs in the NFL would allow both teams to quickly pivot their offensive philosophies to catch up in their respective divisions.

The arguable ""GOAT"" has crossed conferences, but has stayed up to date on his former AFC stomping grounds as the NFL playoffs rage on. His former comrades in New England, making their first postseason appearance since his departure after the 2019-20 season, were swiftly eliminated in a 47-17 shellacking at the hands of the Buffalo Bills in Saturday night\'s portion of the NFL\'s Wild Card playoff proceedings. Western New York has taken each of the first two AFC East titles since No. 12 moved to earn another championship with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.        Speaking with podcast co-host Jim Gray, Brady was impressed with the way Allen performed in the freezing conditions Highmark Stadium had to offer on Saturday night. The quarterback earned five touchdown passes and tallied 374 total yards, including 66 rushing.           “Josh Allen played spectacular football in zero-degree weather and was throwing the football extremely well,"" Brady said.  ""They have a lot of talented skill players. Buffalo was pretty unstoppable that night,"" the famed quarterback told co-host Jim Gray. “Playing in Buffalo, I know how tough it is to play up there. Myself, personally, playing up there found success, obviously, but at the same time they were always challenging games and when those guys get going, man, it’s tough."" Buffalo had a touchdown on all but one of its offensive possessions, the lone exception coming through game-ending kneeldowns. By then, Allen had been lifted for backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky.     Brady was particularly impressed with Allen\'s first score of the night. At the end of Buffalo\'s first possession, Allen fought off a feisty New England pass rush to find tight end Dawson Knox for a leaping, eight-yard score that gave Buffalo a permanent lead and sent Orchard Park into hysterics.

You think you’re throwing a ball out of the back of the end zone to conserve a field goal, next thing you know your tight end is catching in the end zone for a big way to start the game. It was one of those nights where Buffalo’s offense was almost impossible to stop.”     Tom Brady knows a thing... or 33... about succeeding in Buffalo The possibility of a Super Bowl headlined by the Brady-Allen matchup remains in play. The pair did battle during Week 14 of the regular season in December, uniting for 671 passing yards and six total touchdowns. Tampa Bay eventually prevailed in a 33-27 overtime decision at Raymond James Stadium.

53,Andy Dalton,"[""What teams has Andy Dalton played for in the NFL? Journey of the Saints' veteran QB explored  Andy Dalton currently plays for the New Orleans Saints as a quarterback. But after an ugly loss to the Baltimore Ravens in Week 9 of the 2022 NFL season, he might yet lose his place to Jameis Winston again. As has been the story of his life, he has been supplanted by other quarterbacks in the various franchises he has played for, despite not playing particularly badly.  Here, we take a look at all the teams Dalton has played for in his NFL career, starting with the Cincinnati Bengals.        Andy Dalton's journeyman career           Andy Dalton was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft. He quickly established himself as the starter and stablizied the franchise. While there, he made it to three Pro Bowls and took the Bengals towards a sustained period of success in the regular season. The issues cam in the postseason. He could never win a game in the playoffs, and while the Bengals kept faith with him for a long time, they let him go in 2019 for Joe Burrow. Suffice to say, this decision has been vindicated based on last season's performances in Cincinnati. Kevin Cole@KevinColePFFWho can guess which one of these Bengals QB playoff performances is Joe Burrow and which are Andy Dalton?32227Who can guess which one of these Bengals QB playoff performances is Joe Burrow and which are Andy Dalton? https://t.co/tcamgNdbjN     Dalton went to the Dallas Cowboys in 2020 but found himself the backup to Dak Prescott. He was a thorough professional during that time and performed admirably when Prescott was out injured. That earned him a chance with the Chicago Bears in 2021, where he was named the starter ahead of Justin Fields and Nick Foles. Dalton knew that his time as a starter in Chicago was going to be limited, as Fields was being groomed to take over. However, he could not have imagined how soon that would be. He was supplanted as the started in the middle of the season and Justin Fields was given the reins. Dalton played only eight games for Chicago last season and moved on to the New Orleans Saints this season. He got his chance in Week 2, after starting quarterback Jameis Winston went down injured. He started for the next five games, and even when Winston returned, Andy Dalton was named the starting quarterback for Week 9. Yet, in primetime, he again wilted.     trey wingo@wingozWith the loss tonight Andy Dalton QB’ed teams will fall to 6-20 in prime time games.

And The @Saints still have another prime time game this seasonWhether the Saints' current problems damage his chances with the franchise remains to be seen. However, he is quickly running out of wiggle room to resurrect his career anywhere else in the NFL. In his career Dalton has thrown for 36,454 yards, 235 touchdowns and 139 interceptions.

', 'Jameis Winston Week 8 fantasy outlook: Will the New Orleans Saints QB play this weekend?\xa0  Jameis Winston has not played for the New Orleans Saints since aggravating his back injury in Week 3 against the Carolina Panthers. However, there are signs that he should return to action sooner rather than later. In Winston\'s absence, Andy Dalton has taken up the role of the starting quarterback for the NFC South outfit.  Winston took part in full training this week with the Saints and has been declared fit to play in Week 8. But the team\'s head coach, Dennis Allen, is still not convinced with the 28-year-old returning to the fold just yet. Allen confirmed that Dalton will continue to start at quarterback for the Saints against the Las Vegas Raiders.        Nick Underhill@nick_underhillDA says the decision to go with Andy Dalton is a an “offensive decision.” Says they’re going to continue what they’re doing with Dalton. DA says that Jameis Winston is healthy. This is about performance962147DA says the decision to go with Andy Dalton is a an “offensive decision.” Says they’re going to continue what they’re doing with Dalton. DA says that Jameis Winston is healthy. This is about performance           While speaking to reporters, Allen insisted that his decision to start Dalton in Week 8 was to be based on the 34-year-old\'s performance. He said: ""Andy\'s gonna get the start again this week. I feel like he\'s played well. Offensively, I feel like we\'re in a little bit of a rhythm. We\'ve been moving the ball effectively, we\'ve scored points. And so we\'re gonna continue down that road with Andy as the quarterback.""     Dalton has racked up 946 yards and seven touchdowns with four interceptions since starting for the Saints in Week 4. He threw for 361 yards, four touchdowns, and three interceptions in the Saints\' Week 7 loss to the Arizona Cardinals.     Jameis Winston\'s prospects in fantasy football When playing, Jameis Winston finds himself in an eccentric offensive system. Dennis Allen has an unorthodox way of utilizing players on both sides of the ball. This is specifically evident in his usage of tight end Taysom Hill. The tight end often substitutes as a quarterback to open up more options in terms of the running and passing game. This somewhat hinders a player like Winston\'s fantasy output.     In the three games that he started, Winston recorded 858 passing yards and four touchdowns. He holds a passer rating of 79.5 with five interceptions this campaign. However, Winston has thrown at least one touchdown in each game.The Saints quarterback has managed to score 43.92 fantasy points, averaging 14.6 points per game so far. Since Winston will not start in Week 8, steer clear from picking him as your fantasy team\'s quarterback for this weekend.Instead of Jameis Winston, here are some alternate quarterback options for Week 8:Josh AllenPatrick MahomesTom BradyLamar Jackson     ', ""Andy Dalton and the Chicago Bears take on Joe Burrow and the Bengals in Week 2 of the NFL season as the Bears look to get their first win of the year after its Week 1 loss to the LA Rams.  The Bears are coming off a rather underwhelming performance against Matt Stafford and the Rams. They will be looking to get on the winners list for the first time against Joe Burrow and the Bengals in their next match. Here are some details on the upcoming clash.   Bears v Bengals Match Details        Chicago Bears v Cincinnati Bengals           Sunday, September 19, 1:00 PM ET Soldier Field, Chicago Bears v Bengals Betting Odds Andy Dalton and the Bears open up as favorites against the Bengals with the money line set at -140. The spread set is at -2.5 (-115) as they look to notch their first win of the season The Bengals' money line is a +115 and the spread is +2.5 (-107). So there could be some value for the Bengals as Burrow looks to start the new season 2-0. Bears v Bengals Picks The Bears were easily defeated by the Rams on Sunday while the Bengals needed an overtime FG to see off the Minnesota Vikings. At home the Bears are a good choice in this match but the Bengals could get the win if Burrow plays as he did in Week 1. Bears v Bengals Key Injuries     Bengals CB Trae Waynes (hamstring) doubtfulS Ricardo Allen (hand, hamstring) doubtful Bears NT Eddie Goldman (knee) questionableLB Robert Quinn (back) questionable Bears v Bengals Head to Head The last five matchups between the Bears and Bengals have tilted towards Chicago with the Bears leading 3-2. In those five games, the Bears have scored 98 points while the Bengals have scored 97. So expect this encounter to be a close call. Bears v Bengals Prediction After their loss in Week 1, the Bears will be wanting to produce a better performance than they did against the Rams. Whether that will be with Andy Dalton or Justin Fields, remains to be seen. The Bengals will fancy their chances after being bouyed by their win in Week 1. Ja'Marr Chase and Burrow connected really well last week. However, expect the Chicago defense to go after Burrow and Dalton to play far. It might ultimately help them get the win, but only just.

Some bye weeks bite more than others each year. However, since only two sides are on the byes, Fantasy Football Week 8 doesn't present many challenges.  Aaron Rodgers resumed practice on Thursday and is anticipated to play against the Buffalo Bills this weekend.        The Green Bay Packers attack faces a difficult challenge against the Bills, making Rodgers a risky starter. Given the Bills' tendency to score, his throwing volume might be strong, and he is always looking to show up for big occasions. Still, fantasy owners shouldn't depend on this.           WyattzWorld@WyattzWorIdIf you told me 3 months ago that I’d be benching Aaron Rodgers in fantasy football for Andy Dalton, I would have called you insane. but… here we are.3418If you told me 3 months ago that I’d be benching Aaron Rodgers in fantasy football for Andy Dalton, I would have called you insane. but… here we are. For this week, Andy Dalton is a better option than Aaron Rodgers. Against the Las Vegas Raiders this week, Dalton ought to get an opportunity to put on a strong showing. Every quarterback that has played against the Las Vegas side has scored a minimum of 20 Fantasy points this season. The Raiders give up an average of 27.8 points to the position per week.     Dalton surpassed his season-high 34 fantasy points against the Arizona Cardinals last week, and he will have a good chance of exceeding that total in this game. As for Aaron Rodgers and the Packers, the team has only had nine plays of at least 15 yards over the first seven games, tying them for the 21st place. Each of the nine plays involved a pass, and practically all of them necessitated a miraculous throw from Aaron Rodgers. FOX Sports: NFL@NFLonFOXAaron Rodgers had some strong words today talking about the Packers' struggles.16004657Aaron Rodgers had some strong words today talking about the Packers' struggles. https://t.co/SEc6WXwprN Will Andy Dalton start over Jameis Winston in Week 8?     The New Orleans Saints selected Andy Dalton as their starter for this week's game despite his tough performance last Thursday when the quarterback finished the game with multiple interceptions.  Many people might be surprised by the decision to start him. Still, his command of the offensive line does, however, provide the Saints with the best chance to win. In addition, he performed significantly better than his past week's stats indicated. Andy Dalton's potential for Week 8 The New Orleans Saints and the Las Vegas Raiders will play each other this week. Concerning opposing fantasy quarterbacks, the Raiders have the weakest defense in the league. Dalton has a solid edge in the face of a Raiders squad that struggles to force turnovers. As per head coach Dennis Allen, Dalton will make his fifth consecutive start against the Raiders in Week 8. However, the Saints won't rush Jameis Winston back because he hasn't played since Week 3 and wasn't fully healthy going into the week.     Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterAndy Dalton will start this week vs the Raiders, per Dennis Allen.4021249Andy Dalton will start this week vs the Raiders, per Dennis Allen.Dalton has yet to do much to fend off Winston. In last Thursday's humiliating loss to the Arizona Cardinals, he threw two pick-sixes. The Red Rifle has made four starts and has completed 83 of 131 passes for 946 yards, seven touchdowns, four interceptions, and four sacks.     "", ""Andy Dalton or Jimmy Garoppolo: Who is the better fantasy pick?  If you are choosing between Jimmy Garoppolo and Andy Dalton for your fantasy team, there is a lot to consider. In fantasy, who can score you the most points this week is the most important thing, but you must also consider who is a reliable long-term option.  On the surface, there isn't a huge difference between Dalton and Garoppolo, but there's a lot behind the scenes that should determine your choice. Both these quarterbacks started the 2022 season as backups and both are set to start in Week 8. So who should you start in Week 8 and who should you hitch your wagon to for the rest of the season?        We recommend that you start Jimmy Garoppolo rather than Andy Dalton for Week 8 and for the remainder of the campaign.           Why Jimmy Garoppolo is a better fantasy pick than Andy Dalton Kansas City Chiefs v San Francisco 49ers The crux of the matter is that Garoppolo is going to be the starter for the rest of the 2022 season, whereas Dalton looks to be on borrowed time. For Week 8, Garoppolo and the San Francisco 49ers play the Los Angeles Rams. It's a huge game by all accounts, and yes, the Rams defense is scary. Dalton and the New Orleans Saints play the Las Vegas Raiders.     On the surface, this looks like an Andy Dalton week. However, the Saints QB threw three interceptions last week against the Arizona Cardinals (including two pick-sixes) and there are some concerns regarding his ball security. Yes, Garoppolo threw an interception against the Kansas City Chiefs, but he is more composed than Dalton at present. Dalton is starting for New Orleans, but he is unlikely to be their starter for the rest of the season. Jameis Winston is just about healthy and though the Saints are rolling with Dalton, he has to perform to remain the starter and is therefore under pressure. Garoppolo's consistency under center for the 49ers and the offensive weapons at his disposal should give you confidence in starting him. He throws the ball to names like Deebo Samuels and now has Christian McCaffrey, while the Saints are riddled with injuries and question marks. Garoppolo is playing for a Super Bowl contender in San Francisco, so you can be sure he's going to put up numbers as long as he's fit. Dalton, on the other hand, is playing for a struggling team. New Orleans are unlikely to make the playoffs this season and relying on their offense is a risky bet.     Andy Dalton and Jimmy Garoppolo's performances in recent seasons New Orleans Saints v Arizona Cardinals Andy Dalton has been around the league for quite some time, and he has the accolades to prove it. Don't let recency bias fool you, there was a time when he was one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. However, he hasn't been the same since the Bengals released him in 2020 following four losing seasons. Dalton acted as Dak Prescott's backup for the Dallas Cowboys for the 2020 season. He alternated as a starter and backup for the Chicago Bears last campaign, before signing with the New Orleans Saints for the 2022 season. Last season, he passed for 1,512 yards, eight touchdowns, and nine interceptions across eight games.     Jimmy Garoppolo gets so much unfair criticism that it occasionally feels ludicrous. He started his career as Tom Brady's backup on the all-conquering New England Patriots. He was in New England from 2014 until he was traded to the 49ers in 2017. He has remained there since, leading the franchise to numerous winning records and a Super Bowl appearance in 2019. He took the 49ers to the NFC Championship Game in 2021 and was close to leading the franchise to another Super Bowl appearance. Alas, he fell short and the Rams went on to win it all. Last season, Garoppolo passed for 3,810 yards, 27 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions across 15 games. How have Andy Dalton and Jimmy Garoppolo performed this season? Seattle Seahawks v San Francisco 49ersAndy Dalton has performed admirably in New Orleans this season. He has passed for 946 yards, seven touchdowns, and four interceptions in four games. Jimmy Garoppolo came in to steady the ship in San Francisco following an injury to second-year quarterback Trey Lance. Garoppolo has passed for 1,456 yards, nine touchdowns, and four interceptions in six games.     "", '5 observations on Justin Fields\' performance during the Bears\' training camp  Chicago Bears fans cannot wait for Justin Fields to get the starting quarterback spot. They genuinely believe, and with good reason, that the he is their future franchise quarterback. As he takes his place in training, here are some observations on how Justin Fields is staking his claim to the position.  Justin Fields at the Chicago Bears\' Training Camp        #1 - A serious threat with his speed           During training camp, he had to deal with the pass rush from time to time, and he used his speed to good effect. He is adept at escaping the pocket and turning possible sacks into gained yards and first downs. In a recent session, on third-and-12, he accelerated to convert it into a 13 yard gain and slid beautifully to avoid contact. For a quarterback to have a 4.4 second 40 yard dash is a serious tool in the arsenal. #2 - Still learning to curb his enthusiasm While he is undoubtedly a hot prospect in town, he is still learning a lot from veteran quarterback and likely starter in Week 1, Andy Dalton. The latter\'s presence brings serenity to the offense, which makes them more effective. While having Justin Fields can light up the play, having Dalton makes sure that there is no need to go into box-office plays in the first place.     Matt Nagy reiterates Andy Dalton will be Bears\' starter, Justin Fields ""our No. 2"" https://t.co/RuoSJQcIgg pic.twitter.com/ILLxjrtAVN— Around The NFL (@AroundTheNFL) June 15, 2021 #3 - Getting used to the speed of professional football By his own admission, Justin Fields is still getting used to the speed of the NFL. That is not a surprise given just how much of a gulf there is between college and professional football. However, hearing it from the horse\'s mouth gives an impression of a player who is aware of the challenges ahead and accordingly willing to confront them. It also shows humility on the part of a young player.     Bears QB Justin Fields: ""The speed is a lot faster in the NFL.""— Mark Grote (@markgrotesports) August 2, 2021 #4 - Capable of incredible throws Anyone who has observed Justin Fields during training camp will have seen him make spectacular deep throws with stunning accuracy. However, he has a lot more tricks up his sleeve, which he demonstrated with some outrageous throws, including a sidearm.         #5 - Has the respect of veteransAs a rookie, it is not easy to come into any dressing room and command the respect of those who have been there and done that before. However, his performances have merited that recognition from his teammates already, with Jimmy Graham comparing him to Russell Wilson.     ', ""Matt Nagy was thought to be on the way out of Chicago after Thanksgiving  This season has not been kind to Matt Nagy and his Chicago Bears. This season, they have experienced poor performances, quarterback controversies and everything in between. Unfortunately, the year 2021 has not been great if you are a Bears fan.  Currently third in the NFC North, the Bears defeated the Detroit Lions with a last second field goal, 16-14, in the first of three games on Thanksgiving.        The build-up to the game was dominated by Nagy and his coaching future with the franchise. Several reports swirled around that the Thanksgiving game would be his last, a source close to the situation told patch.com.           Given how the team and franchise have performed overall, the decision to relieve Nagy of his duties would not be a surprise. Nagy will not be fired mid-season Despite rumors that Nagy would not be the Chicago Bears head coach beyond Thanksgiving, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported Thursday morning on NFL Gameday that he does not see Nagy being removed mid-season. Ian Rapoport@RapSheetFrom @NFLGameDay: Reviewing the status of #Bears coach Matt Nagy, who works for an organization that doesn’t believe in firing coaches midseason. … Plus, an update on #Bears QB Justin Fields and his cracked ribs.1:55 AM · Nov 26, 202135951From @NFLGameDay: Reviewing the status of #Bears coach Matt Nagy, who works for an organization that doesn’t believe in firing coaches midseason. … Plus, an update on #Bears QB Justin Fields and his cracked ribs. https://t.co/kL3R7eqtWl     Past history shows that the Bears have not fired head coaches in the middle of the season, and it appears that Nagy will not be the next NFL coach to lose his job, at least, not at this point in time. The Bears did work hard to getting past the winless Lions today, but veteran Andy Dalton threw for 317 passing yards with a touchdown and an interception as he showed that he can still be a valuable contributor to the team.

While it did take a last-second field goal to get the team's fourth win of the year, it was a win nonetheless, and at least today, the Chicago Bears and Nagy have something to be thankful for. The win will likely not do much in the overall scheme of things for Nagy in Chicago, but it does give the team something positive to hang on to until they face the Arizona Cardinals on December 6. Firing Nagy midway through the season would not solve the team's problems and would likely create another, especially with Fields for the second half of the year. By sticking with Nagy, the Bears give Fields a good chance to develop under one coach, not two, in one season.Whether or not Nagy remains the Bears coach beyond this season is unknown, but at least, after Thursday's victory, the pressure on organization is relieved. Until they play next, that is.     "", 'Kyle Brandt on Justin Fields: ""the most NFL-ready player.""  Referring to Justin Fields on Good Morning Football, show co-host Kyle Brandt said that he ""can\'t think of a more NFL-ready player than this guy.""  ""I cant think of a more NFL ready player than this guy."" -- @KyleBrandt Should Justin Fields be the Bears starting QB in Week 1? pic.twitter.com/UrTA1Rlr8y— GMFB (@gmfb) May 10, 2021        Why Justin Fields is the most NFL-ready player           The show pointed out that Justin Fields led the FBS with 78 total touchdowns from 2019 to 2020. The host also explained that Justin Fields has the experience with big-time games and playoff situations to be able to skip the bridge-quarterback stage and simply start in Week One. Kyle Brandt also went on to show why Matt Nagy might be on the same page as Brandt. He explained that Fields is ""Matt Nagy\'s guy,"" pointing out that Mitchell Trubisky predated Nagy\'s tenure. Brandt then explained that Nagy\'s shown himself to take quarterbacks out of the game quickly when he thinks they are not the solution. Nagy did this with Mitchell Trubisky when he sat him for Nick Foles last season. Brandt explained that since Nagy is likely to be quickly unhappy with bridge-quarterback Andy Dalton\'s performance anyway, why not just go straight to Justin Fields?     It is also worth pointing out that Matt Nagy is seen largely as ""Andy Reid Jr."" around the league. Meaning, he has a similar football philosophy to Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and the same potential ability as him. The hope for Bears fans is now that Matt Nagy has his guy, the Bears can get something going similar to what Kansas City is now enjoying with Patrick Mahomes. If Justin Fields starts this season, his most reliable target will be wide receiver Allen Robinson. He\'ll also have Cole Kmet as an option. In case he fails to throw the ball, he would have running back David Montgomery to lean on. Allen Robinson     Allen Robinson is coming off a superb season based on his PFF grade of 88.4. In 2020, he caught over 100 passes and reached 1250 yards of offense in addition to six touchdowns. The next quarterback will rely heavily on him. Cole Kmet will be entering his second year after a quiet rookie season in which he caught 28 balls for 243 yards and two touchdowns. David Montgomery will be entering his third season after finishing last year with over 1000 yards and eight touchdowns.📼: @ColeKmet Pick: 43rd overallYear: 2020 #NFLDraft▶️: First career TD pic.twitter.com/KDOqu67E7s— Chicago Bears (@ChicagoBears) April 20, 2021Overall, the supporting cast would be young for Justin Fields but decent enough to work with, assuming he is good enough to hit his targets and direct defenses.     ', 'Top 10 TCU Football players of all time  The TCU Horned Frogs are readying themselves for a huge championship clash against Georgia, but who are the top 10 TCU representatives of all time?  The modern era has produced fewer greats from Texas Christian University than in previous years, although Andy Dalton and LaDainian Tomlinson are the two standouts of the 2000s.        Only one player from the university has even won the Heisman Trophy, and that was Davey O’Brien, although 2022’s Max Duggan was the runner-up in the voting for the award.           Duggan was the figurehead of the 2022 Horned Frogs, leading the team from the quarterback position and registering a 13-1 record for the season, one game behind the Georgia Bulldogs. Having been a slow-burner in terms of his development, Duggan’s draft stock isn’t too high; he isn’t considered among the elite QBs of the class, but his performances this year can’t be ignored. Who are the 10 best TCU players of all-time?  #10 Max Duggan (2019 – 2022) Vrbo Fiesta Bowl - Michigan v TCU     Max Duggan led Texas Christian University to the national championship game in 2022 and has done so in spectacular style. It’s unclear whether or not he has the natural talent to be a starting quarterback in the NFL, but his collegiate career will go down as one of the greatest in TCU history. In 2022 he finished as a runner-up in the Heisman Trophy voting after throwing for 3,321 yards, 30 touchdowns, and a completion percentage of 64.9. #9 Jim Swink (1955 - 1957) Swink was an All-American running back during his years with the Horned Frogs, and he is remembered as one of the very best to ever play the position in the Southwest Conference. Swink’s collegiate performances were impressive, leading the team to back-to-back Conference Championships, although he was only a second-round draft choice by the Chicago Bears in the NFL. The rusher was almost a Heisman Trophy winner for TCU, but he fell short, being voted as a runner-up.     #8 Jason Verrett (2011 - 2013) San Diego Chargers v Kansas City Chiefs Verrett was one of the greatest athletes to ever compete for the Horned Frogs. Whilst playing all across the secondary throughout his college football career, he also excelled in track and field. In a 2007 100m dash, he recorded a time of 11.87 seconds. This was a major boost to his game on the football field. He initially represented Santa Rosa Junior College, but a year later transferred to TCU. In his debut year, he recorded 58 tackles as a cornerback, albeit sometimes playing as a safety, and then in 2012 he had 63 tackles and six interceptions, the highest of all the team’s defenders.     His brilliant college career in Texas propelled Verrett to the third-ranked cornerback prospect in the country, and he was then drafted 25th overall by the San Diego Chargers. #7 Larry Brown (1989 – 1991) Super Bowl XXVII: Buffalo Bills v Dallas Cowboys Larry Brown is another great athlete who split his time between football and other athletics. Whilst eventually a defensive star, he also played running back at times. TCU made him their starting left cornerback after transferring to the college as a junior, and he recorded 75 tackles, two interceptions, and 10 successful pass defenses.     In the Blue-Gray Football Classic, where he was invited as one of the nation’s best defenders, Brown earned the MVP award after making nine tackles. Brown would go on to play for the Dallas Cowboys, Oakland Raiders and Minnesota Vikings in the NFL. #6 Aaron Schobel (1997 – 2001) Buffalo Bills v New England Patriots In his three seasons with the TCU Horned Frogs, Aaron Schobel was a productive pass rusher. He managed to dominate O-Lines at the college level due to his side and explosive first-step. In 2000 he was voted the WAC Defensive Player of the Year.     By the time Schobel left Texas Christian, he was the team’s all-time leader in sacks after registering 31 throughout his college career. His NFL career began as a second-round pick for the Buffalo Bills, but is most remembered due to the fact Schobel is the player who has recorded the most NFL sacks on Tom Brady. #5 Andy Dalton (2007 – 2011) New Orleans Saints v Philadelphia Eagles Andy Dalton was a brilliant quarterback for the TCU Horned Frogs. He never threw for less than 2,200 yards in his four seasons with the program.     His breakthrough year came in 2010 when he threw for 2,857 yards and 27 touchdowns, earning him a second-round draft selection by the Cincinnati Bengals. #4 Sammy Baugh (1935 – 1938) ""Slingin’ Sam Baugh"" revolutionized how college football was played during his career with the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs. He threw the ball with reckless abandon, but gained incredible yardage. Throughout his college career, he recorded 39 touchdown passes and amassed 3,384 passing yards at a time when they were much harder to get. #3 Bob Lilly (1958 – 1960) Nobody is more synonymous with Texas football than ""Mr. Cowboy"" Bob Lilly. He was an integral part of TCU’s football program in the late 1950s and is one of their most famous alumni. His tough-nosed defensive play was brutal, but effective for the Horned Frogs, who under his guidance were able to have a defense that allowed eight points per game. #2 Davey O’Brien (1936 – 1938) Davey O’Brien has gone down in history as the only TCU player to win the Heisman Trophy award.     In the 1938 season, he threw for 1,457 passing yards and 19 touchdown passes. He was one of TCU’s greatest ever performers, being named to 13 All-America teams. He was selected fourth-overall in the NFL Draft and was the first ever Heisman Trophy winner to play in the NFL. #1 LaDainian Tomlinson (1997 – 2001) Texas Christian V Colorado State LaDainian Tomlinson stands atop this list as one of the most consistent running backs the modern NFL has seen. He was one of the constant positive presences on a San Diego Chargers team that was never able to utilize its full potential.     Tomlinson’s 2000 season with TCU was one of the most memorable in college history.In 11 games, he rushed for 2,158 yards and scored 22 touchdowns. It earned him the Jim Brown Trophy and the WAC Offensive Player of the Year.He is an inductee in the College Football Hall of Fame and remains one of the TCU’s greatest ever products.     ']"
54,Brett Hundley,"[""NFL preseason best games ever  Every player who enters the NFL via the draft or switches teams in the offseason is desperate to make a good impression early on. Despite coaches preferring players to take it easy to avoid injury, these men are fighting for roster spots and starting positions.  Plenty of NFL players have had outstanding performances in preseason games, and here are three of the best.        3 best single-game preseason performances in NFL history            #3 – Brett Hundley Tennessee Titans v Green Bay Packers Brett Hundley served as Aaron Rodgers’ backup for the Green Bay Packers, meaning starts would be hard to come by. Despite this, he turned a few heads during the 2015 preseason in a game against the New Orleans Saints. Hundley completed 16 of 23 passes for 236 yards, as well as passing for four touchdowns in the 38-10 victory. However, Hundley would never get close to a starting role in Green Bay, and has bounced around the league since. Hundley has played for the Seahawks, Cardinals, Colts and Ravens, and has only started nine NFL games in his seven-year career thus far.     Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterRavens announced they signed QB Brett Hundley.6159259Ravens announced they signed QB Brett Hundley. #2 – Mack Brown San Francisco 49ers v Washington Redskins     We don’t often see huge rushing numbers in the preseason, as teams don’t tend to give many carries to one running back. However, this didn’t stop the Washington Commanders from giving Mack Brown 19 carries in a 2016 preseason outing against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brown didn’t let the opportunity pass him by, rushing for 149 yards and a touchdown. He would go on to lead the entire preseason in rushing yards in 2016, but that didn’t stop the Redskins from cutting him shortly before the season. Brown has bounced around the league since, and the 30-year-old was last seen in the NFL with the Oakland Raiders in 2019. #1 – Victor Cruz Super Bowl XLVI     Arguably the most memorable single preseason game in league history belongs to former New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz. Cruz was an undrafted free agent coming out of UMass, he shined against the Giants’ city rivals the New York Jets. Cruz caught six passes for 145 yards and three touchdowns, making the NFL world stand up and take notice. LeBron James@KingJamesVictor Cruz going nuts on the Jets tonight on #MNF. Undrafted rookie from UMass. He's gonna have a job this year for sure117443Victor Cruz going nuts on the Jets tonight on #MNF. Undrafted rookie from UMass. He's gonna have a job this year for sureThe Giants then made sure to keep him in the building. After missing much of his rookie year through injury, Cruz would go on to have two successive 1,000 yard seasons in 2011 and 2012. Cruz was also part of the Giants side that won Super Bowl XLVI against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.     "", ""Davante Adams: Can Packers wide receiver hold the number one spot if Rodgers doesn't return?  Davante Adams has fallen into the drama that Aaron Rodgers has swirled up, bringing into question his ability to succeed without Green Bay's beloved quarterback.  Aaron Rodgers has the NFL world holding their breath - How will the Green Bay Packers perform without their three-time MVP?        Granted, the Packers are one of the only teams that possess a top-five receiver (Davante Adams) and running back (Aaron Jones).           But losing Rodgers would be a big blow and would most certainly throw the team a challenge. Rodgers is a generational player, and Green Bay is going to feel an aftershock should he leave. Will Davante Adams be enough to fill the void for Aaron Rodgers. The Packers are not devoid of talent; between Adams and Jones (especially in Matt LaFleur's offense), Green Bay may have enough firepower to score plenty of points.  Jordan Love has enough talent and he will be hoping to reach the level of performance he did in his first year. The franchise will want to contend for a playoff spot this time. Adams exploded last year within 15 games. The wide receiver caught 115 passes for 1,374 yards and a league-high of 18 touchdowns on his way to being named a First-team All-Pro.     The 28-year-old wide receiver has been one of the NFL's top receivers for a few years, erupting in 2018 with 1,386 yards and 13 touchdowns. You think @tae15adams is top two and not two?(via @jfowlerespn) pic.twitter.com/22LDjlmbcZ— B/R Gridiron (@brgridiron) July 15, 2021 There is an argument that Adams will not be as fruitful without Rodgers because a wide receiver will see his numbers go down without an elite quarterback throwing him the ball. While that may be true, we can look back at the 2017 season when Adam played without Rodgers for an expanded period of time.     Rodgers broke his collarbone in week six of the 2017 season while playing against the Minnesota Vikings, sidelining him for most of the season. Rodgers's backup quarterback was Brett Hundley, who had never started an NFL game until the 2017 season. Aaron Rodgers leaves game with shoulder injury📰: https://t.co/xB8adles6L #GBvsMIN pic.twitter.com/KQeIOF1m1A— Green Bay Packers (@packers) October 15, 2017 With Hundley, Adams averaged more receptions and yards per game; his touchdown total of five was the same as both quarterbacks. Adams faired well with a mediocre quarterback who had never seen a single start. Despite Hundley being behind center, Adams averaged 8.88 targets a game compared to 7.66 with Rodgers in the 2017 season. Adams has averaged 8.43 targets a game in his entire career.     It doesn’t matter if it’s Aaron Rodgers or Brett Hundley at quarterback, Mike McCarthy or Joe Philbin on the headset. Davante Adams doesn’t care.Or at least that’s what his play suggests.Story here: https://t.co/8BoyNxvdRO— Rob Demovsky (@RobDemovsky) December 14, 2018Based on these numbers, it's arguable that the quarterback will depend on an elite wide receiver.While Rodgers leaving the franchise will be devastating, it doesn't remove the talent that is Davante Adams.     "", ""NFL 2018 Squad Preview: Green Bay Packers  The Green Bay Packers are used to being serious contenders in the NFC, but the 2017 season did not go as planned. The Packers franchise Quarterback Aaron Rodgers went down with a broken collarbone in week 6, causing him to miss the majority of the rest of the season.  With Rodgers missing, the Packers failed in their quest to make the playoffs. Furthermore, with their star QB out of action, the weaknesses in the Green Bay squad were clear to see. Without Rodgers putting consistent points on the board, more pressure was put on a depleted defense, with backup QB Brett Hundley unable to keep up with the opponents' scoring. There were a lot of holes in this team that needed to be addressed this offseason.        The Packers have strengthened some of their weaknesses through the Draft and a somewhat busier Free Agency, under the direction of new General Manager Brian Gutekunst.           Green Bay Packers Here, I break down the Packers roster to determine their strengths and weaknesses by position. Quarterback - STRENGTH The Quarterback position is obviously a strong one for the Packers. Aaron Rodgers is one of the best QBs that the league has ever seen. He is fully recovered from his collarbone injury that derailed his 2017 season. He is expected to once again be in the MVP talk come the end of this coming season.     Behind him, Brett Hundley showed he can play in the NFL, but nowhere near the standard the Green Bay faithful have become accustomed to over the last 25 years. Hundley’s play last year obviously made the Green Bay hierarchy think twice about the backup situation. So much so, the Packers traded their best CB from last year, Damarious Randall, to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for their starting QB Deshone Kizer. Kizer was thrown into the deep end in his rookie season. He struggled in a poor team, failing to get a win during the whole season. Kizer did flash potential though, and the Packers obviously think he can progress his game sitting behind Rodgers for a few years. It will be interesting to see who comes out on top if Rodgers suffers another injury. Offensive Line - STRENGTH NFL: DEC 31 Packers at Lions     The Packers had an injury-hit 2017 season at Offensive Line. The only player to play all 16 games was Center, Corey Linsley. Linsley had a decent season as the linchpin of the Packers OL, giving up just one sack on the year. The Packers showed they have good strength in depth as they used a number of different combinations of players, including David Bakhtiari, Jahri Evans, Lane Taylor, Justin McCray, Jason Spriggs, Kyle Murphy and Bryan Bulaga. This year, the Packers will hope that their line can stay healthy and string together games without having to change up players positions. Pro Football Focus had Green Bay’s OL ranked at number 13 in the league which is impressive considering how many changes had to be made. Going into 2018 training camps, The Packers depth chart currently reads: LT – David Bakhtiari LG – Lane Taylor C – Corey Linsley RG – Justin McCray RT – Bryan Bulaga. Bakhtiari is arguably one of the best Left Tackles in the game when he’s healthy, excelling in pass protection and improving his run blocking. He is vital for the Packers as the leader of the OL. Linsley earned himself a new contract in the offseason, after his displays in 2017.     Bryan Bulaga will be welcomed back after injury. Bulaga has regularly played at a Pro Bowl level when on the field, but injuries have really hampered his career, playing 16 games in just 2 of his 7 seasons in the league. When healthy, Bulaga and Bakhtiari form an imposing pair of tackles for opposition defenders to try and get around. Justin McCray has earned himself a shot at the Right Guard position following the 2017 season, where he was asked to fill in all across the Offensive Line. His play convinced the Packers to not re-sign veteran Jahri Evans. I expect the Packers Offensive Line to be amongst the Top 10 OLs this season if they can keep their core players healthy. Running Back - STRENGTH Jamaal Williams celebrating his touchdown run     This year, the Packers possess one of the strongest Running Back Corps in the NFL. At the same time last offseason, there were concerns about the Packers backfield as it comprised of 2 rookies and a converted Wide Receiver. A year on and there is a lot more optimism due to their impressive displays in 2017. Ty Montgomery started as the lead back last year until an injury derailed his season. He was a true workhorse in the opening couple of games, being on the field for over 90% of snaps. Even though he impressed when called upon, the former Wide Receiver is entering this training camp as the RB3 in the Packers Offense. This is due to the impressive form shown by both Jamaal Williams and Aaron Jones. Williams was second on the depth chart to start the year and took over from Montgomery when he got injured. The injury bug once again struck as Williams was the next to go down. Aaron Jones showed that he can lead the backfield with an impressive run of performances. All in all, the Packers have 3 very capable Running Backs on their roster.     There has been talk and speculation all offseason about who will be atop the depth chart come September 9th. Much to the frustration of fantasy owners everywhere, the latest from the Green Bay camp is that it’ll be a ‘committee approach’ at running back this year. Unless someone goes down with injury in the early weeks, expect a 3 headed monster at RB for the Packers this season. Wide Receiver – WEAKNESS Adams and Allison The Wide Receiver position is usually one of strength for the Green Bay Packers. However, this season it is different, as the departure of Jordy Nelson has left a huge hole at outside receiver. Nelson was Rodgers favourite target, and his telepathic relationship with his QB will no doubt be missed.     The WR1 spot will be strong as Davante Adams has the chance to be a true elite WR in this league. Adams has the most TDs in the league over the past two seasons, and has also shown he can get it done with either Rodgers or Brett Hundley throwing to him. Adams will continue to be Rodgers favorite Red Zone target. Behind Adams, Randall Cobb has to step up. Cobb, who will play the majority of snaps out of the slot, will see an increase in targets with Nelson gone. He will hope to rekindle his 2014 form where he scored 12 TDs and caught 91 passes for over 1200 yards. Opposite Adams on the outside, Geronimo Allison is the de facto WR2. Allison has shown he can produce decent performances when called upon in the past. It will be interesting to see if he can make that jump in productivity and keep a starting slot.     Behind him, The Packers drafted 3 Receivers in the 2018 draft. J’Mon Moore, Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Equanimeous St Brown will battle it out at training camp to determine their position on the depth chart. Moore is being projected to nudge Allison out of his WR2 spot come the end of the season. Tight End – STRENGTH NFL: MAY 31 Packers OTA The Tight End position has been somewhat problematic for the Packers over the past few seasons. Many have tried and failed to produce on a consistent basis. Last year's Free Agency acquisition Martellus Bennett didn’t work out, Richard Rodgers was released after a few poor years and Jared Cook was free to go to Oakland after the 2016 season.     However, the Packers dipped their feet into the Free Agency market again, signing Jimmy Graham to a 3 year $30 million contract. Graham will be a vital component of this offense, providing a big weapon for Rodgers in the Red Zone. Graham has lost a step in recent years, but he still had double-digit TDs last season. The Packers also signed Marcedes Lewis, who wasn’t re-signed in Jacksonville. While the signing of Lewis won’t excite many fans around the league, he could be a lot more valuable than most people realise. Last season Lewis was ranked as the best run blocking Tight End in the league per Pro Football Focus. He also chipped in with 6 TDs for the Jaguars. He won’t be used too much in the passing game this season, but he could be vital for the offense and their Running Back committee. Lance Kendricks is the TE3 on the depth chart this season. He will also be used primarily as a blocker.     Defensive Line – STRENGTH Seattle Seahawks v Green Bay Packers - Mike Daniels celebrating The Packers' D-Line has become a strength of this defense in the past couple of seasons. The line is led by 2017 Pro-Bowl player, Mike Daniels, who will look to continue his brilliant form from the past season. Nose tackle Kenny Clark took a big step up last year and will look to cement his place as one of the best young NT in the league. Dean Lowry also impressed at times last year in his first full season as a starter. These 3 players will be joined by new recruit Muhammed Wilkerson and second-year player Montravius Adams. Wilkerson was signed in Free Agency to a 1-year deal. The Packers will hope he can recapture his form from a couple of seasons ago where he played under new Packers DC Mike Pettine in New York.     Linebacker – WEAKNESS Wild Card Round - Green Bay Packers v Washington Redskins The Linebacking corps should be a strength for the Packers on paper. But each year the Packers' main pass rushers seem to be hampered by injury. The two players I’m talking about are Nick Perry and Clay Matthews. Matthews was one of the best OLB’s in the league once upon a time. In recent years he’s struggled with injuries which have really affected his ability to get to the opposing QB.     Perry had similar struggles last season after having a very strong 2016. At ILB, Blake Martinez impressed in 2017, recording the most tackles in the league with 144. He also played 979 of 1052 defensive snaps for the Packers, which ranked second on the team. He was joined at ILB by second-year player Jake Ryan, who will look to improve on his snap percentage of 48.2%. Vince Biegel will look to work his way in to the defensive plans in 2018. Biegel will have a full offseason behind him, after his 2017 was hampered by injury right from the get-go. Cornerback - WEAKNESS 2018 NFL Draft     The Cornerback position has been a huge weakness for the Packers in the past few seasons. They ranked among the worst in the league in 2017, which caused the Packers to focus heavily on the position in the draft. They traded their top CB from last year, Damarious Randall to the Browns, and therefore used their first two picks on Jaire Alexander and Josh Jackson. Both players will likely play a big part for the Packers this season. The current starters at CB are second-year player Kevin King and the returning veteran Tramon Williams. Williams surprisingly ranked as the 9th best CB in the league last year at the age of 34. He will be the perfect player for the rookies to learn from. Whilst this corps is much improved from last season, it still has to be regarded as a weakness until we see the rookies produce at NFL level. Safety – WEAKNESS     Indianapolis Colts v Green Bay Packers The Safety position contributed to the Packers' defensive struggles last season. Usually led by the dependable Haha Clinton Dix, the unit struggled in coverage all season. Clinton-Dix was well below his usual level of play, with pundits voicing concerns over his commitment to the team. He was joined at safety by Morgan Burnett and Josh Jones. Burnett has been a fixture in the Packers secondary for years, but he was allowed to hit the Free Agent market this offseason and was duly snapped up by the Steelers. Josh Jones will fill his starting role in the side, whilst looking to improve on his 2017, where he admitted to not playing to the best of his ability. The whole secondary struggled last season as the Packers' pass rush wasn’t very effective, giving opposing QBs the time for their WRs to get open. With an improved pass rush this year, I expect to see the secondary step up their level of play.

News broke on the first day of the 2021 NFL draft that the Packers’ star quarterback and three-time MVP Aaron Rodgers wanted out of Green Bay.  Reigning MVP Aaron Rodgers is so disgruntled with the Green Bay Packers that he has told some within the organization that he does not want to return to the team, league and team sources told ESPN on Thursday.More on NFL Live now....— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) April 29, 2021        To say this has thrown a wrench in the defending NFC North champion’s plans for this season would be an understatement. Quarterback Jordan Love, who has yet to take a snap in an NFL game, is the only other play-caller currently on the Packers roster.           Three potential QB options for the Green Bay Packers The Packers were always going to bring another quarterback into training camp, but now they may be looking for a potential starter in 2021. Unfortunately for the Packers, there are not many quality NFL free agent quarterbacks available. Here are three veteran quarterbacks the Packers could sign ahead of their preseason. #1 - Nick Mullens San Francisco 49ers v Dallas Cowboys     Former 49ers quarterback Nick Mullens is the best available free agent that the Packers could bring into their preseason workouts. The 26-year-old started 16 games for the Niners across the 2018 and 2020 regular seasons. He is 5-11 as a starter, throwing for 25 touchdowns with 22 interceptions and averaging 249 passing yards per game. Mullens has a career total QBR of 87.2 and would give the Packers a solid starting option if Rodgers was to be traded away. #2 - Brett Hundley Green Bay Packers v Washington Redskins Former backup quarterback Brett Hundley is another option for the Packers.     Hundley was drafted by the Packers in the fifth round of the 2015 NFL draft. He was the backup to Aaron Rodgers from 2015-17. After Rodgers broke his collarbone in 2017, Hundley started nine games for Green Bay. He threw for 1,836 yards and nine touchdowns with 12 interceptions, while also rushing for 270 yards and two touchdowns. The fact he has previous experience with Green Bay makes him an obvious free-agent target for the franchise.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Brett Hundley Jr (@bretthundley7) #3 - Robert Griffin III Washington Redskins v San Francisco 49ers     A wild card option for the Green Bay Packers is former NFL Offense Rookie of the Year Robert Griffin III.The number two draft pick in the 2012 NFL Draft has been plagued by injuries and inconsistent performances. RG3 has thrown 42 touchdowns with 30 interceptions in his NFL career.Now an eight-season NFL veteran, Griffin could be the perfect mentor for Packers rookie QB Jordan Love if Rodgers is traded. He also brings a different style of play compared to Rodgers.     ', ""Is Carson Wentz playing tonight vs Ravens in Week 5?  Will he or won't he play?

But....-Nonstop injuries-Wentz still finding his way in changing his styleNow Indy has to play catch up w/winsespn.com/blog/indianapo… If Carson Wentz wasn't able to play, the Colts would have had to go with Brett Hundley. Hundley is a journeyman quarterback who has spent time with the Cardinals and Packers over the last five years. His career win-loss record of 3-6 with more interceptions than touchdowns in the NFL. Needless to say, starting Hundley for Monday Night Football could have been a nightmare for Colts fans. However, with Wentz starting and coming off a solid performance against the Dolphins, the Colts have a shot to give Baltimore a run for their money. Last week, Wentz threw for 228 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. He also completed a season-high 75 percent of his throws.         Considering the Ravens' 24th-ranked pass defense, Wentz could have another solid game. If the quarterback has a great day, the Ravens could be in for a tough game. However, the Colts have their own injury issues outside of Carson Wentz to overcome. TY Hilton, JJ Nelson, and Quenton Nelson will not be playing in this game. TY Hilton's absence combined with Quenton Nelson's injury hampers the Colts' ability to throw the ball deep. First, the Colts will need a top receiver to stretch the defense without Hilton. Secondly, the offensive line needs to give Wentz time as he waits for other receiver routes to develop.     Seattle Seahawks v Indianapolis ColtsEssentially, the Colts will need to keep the game close for four quarters in order to win. If they need to throw deep, they could be in trouble. For a quarterback with Wentz's injury history, it is doubly imperative that the Colts protect Wentz and play well in tonight's game.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 6 TV Schedule     "", ""Tennessee Titans vs Indianapolis Colts prediction, odds and picks - September 26 | NFL 2021-22 season  The Tennessee Titans host the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday in what will be the first AFC South divisional game of the season for both teams.

He was once so good that he won a Super Bowl MVP award after handing a big, fat L to the greatest quarterback of all time, Tom Brady. Foles is one of just two QBs to get the better of Tom Brady in a Super Bowl, and he did that with a bandaged-up arm.           Nick Foles played in the Super Bowl in February 2018. Foles led the Philadelphia Eagles to a win over Bill Belichick's New England Patriots. Foles was in the zone throughout the playoffs, completing 77 of his 106 playoff pass attempts (72.6%). He threw for 971 yards (9.2 average), six touchdowns and one interception with a 115.7 passer rating. In essence, though Foles might not be the best quarterback in the league (he is likely not in the top five of backup QBs), he was dependable during his heyday. Foles was never scared of the opposition, he believed in playing the right way, and he brought a Super Bowl to the city of Philadelphia.

Nick Foles is not a solid fantasy pickup by any stretch of the imagination, as he is a backup quarterback on one of the worst teams in the league. Foles recently got the nod to play in a few games for the Colts, who do not have a season to save.  The decision to start Foles is beyond dangerous, considering this is playoff time in fantasy football.     The veteran shot caller will have a chance to remedy his errors in Week 17 as the Colts attempt to look for an answer at QB while the season rounds up. Foles made 17 of 29 pass attempts for 143 yards, zero touchdowns and three interceptions in the loss against the Chargers. Matt Ryan and Sam Ehlinger will be watching from the bleachers as they hope to get some playing time in the Colts' last two games.Charlie Clifford@cliffWISH8Nick Foles on the move to starting QB. @WISH_TV15112Nick Foles on the move to starting QB. @WISH_TV https://t.co/WeqBhl5UbbFoles has recorded 143 passing yards, zero touchdowns, and three interceptions in two games this season.

"", 'NFL history: The 5 worst offseason moves of all-time  NFL owners aren’t shy about taking out their wallets and plunking down enormous sums of cash in front of free agents. Yet, maybe they should.  In some instances, even the biggest and most notable star players have struggled in new locations on their NFL new teams. As we peek around today’s landscape, it’s difficult to pinpoint who will become the next player to struggle after being given an enormous contract.        Will Von Miller live up to the hype in Buffalo after being handed a six-year deal worth $120 million? How about Davante Adams? Now that he has his money, will he live up to the five-year, $141 million contract given to him by the Las Vegas Raiders?           All of those questions will be answered this season. But before we find out which moves were sagacious, let’s look back at some of the most horrendous offseason moves in NFL history. #1. Daunte Culpepper Minnesota Vikings v Detroit Lions     At one point, Daunte Culpepper was a terrific NFL quarterback. In 2003 and 2004, in particular, the light switch went off. The former Minnesota Viking made back-to-back Pro Bowls and led the Vikings to respectability. In 2004, he led the entire NFL in passing yards, throwing for 4,717 to go along with 39 touchdowns. Unfortunately for Culpepper, his career took a turn for the worse during the 2005 season. Halfway through the year, Culpepper crumbled to the turf with a torn ACL, MCL, and PCL in his knee. For whatever reason, the Miami Dolphins believed they could get Culpepper’s career back on track. In exchange, the franchise handed over a 2006 second-round pick to the Vikings but quickly moved off him. In only four games, Culpepper was a shell of his former self, leading the Dolphins to only one victory during his time as a starter while throwing two touchdowns and three interceptions. #2. Nick Foles Chicago Bears v Jacksonville Jaguars     Nick Foles effectively turned two of the best years of his career into life-changing money with the Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2017, the hopes and dreams of the Philadelphia Eagles were pinned firmly on the shoulders of Foles. Made For Philly@MadeForPhillyThe best individual performance in Philadelphia sports history.Nick Foles. SBLII.2951610The best individual performance in Philadelphia sports history.Nick Foles. SBLII. https://t.co/qoQ57wfKph With Carson Wentz forced to miss the entire NFL postseason due to a torn ACL, Foles was asked to step up. To the surprise of many, he would do so in a big way.         Foles and his Eagles took care of business throughout the playoffs, resulting in an unlikely Super Bowl ring. The following year, Wentz went down with another injury before the playoffs, with Foles again leading them on another deep run. The Jaguars saw more than enough out of Blake Bortles and opted to go in another direction, handing Foles a four-year deal worth $88 million. In the first game of the NFL 2019 season, Foles suffered a broken Clavicle. While he would eventually return several months later, he did deliver his best. In just one season, the Jaguars decided against keeping Foles as their long-term solution as their starter, going with Gardner Minshew and sending Foles to the Chicago Bears. #3. Matt Flynn Green Bay Packers v Miami Dolphins     Throughout our infamous list and littered across NFL history, players have inked enormous contracts due to a stellar breakout season. Maybe even two. Never, however, has a player been rewarded due to one game. Well, meet Matt Flynn. Eli Berkovits@BookOfEli_NFLThrowback to Matt Flynn\'s LEGENDARY 480 yard, 6 TD performance in 2011...What a game.1703135Throwback to Matt Flynn\'s LEGENDARY 480 yard, 6 TD performance in 2011...What a game.https://t.co/Rpiri8c2gU With a historically significant season already wrapped up, Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers were on their way to the NFL postseason in 2011 after putting together a 14-1 record. In the season\'s final game, Rodgers sat on the sidelines, as did many of the starters. In his place, of course, was backup Matt Flynn.     A relative unknown at this point, Flynn turned several heads with his jaw-dropping performance. Flynn threw for 480 yards, completing 31 of his 44 passes and lofting six—yes, six!—touchdowns into the end zone. The Seattle Seahawks believed the then 27-year-old was their quarterback of the future, inking him to a three-year deal worth $19 million.    Shortly after, Flynn was outplayed in training camp by rookie Russell Wilson. Flynn became expendable and was traded the following year to the Buffalo Bills.     #4. Brock Osweiler Divisional Round - Houston Texans v New England Patriots Quarterbacks don\'t usually come in Brock Osweiler\'s size. The former second-round pick stood at 6\'7"" and weighed 240 pounds. But despite his enormous dimensions, Osweiler was far from impressive. Yet, regardless of his unimpressive play, the Houston Texans gave the middling quarterback a four-year deal worth $72 million. Overall, Osweiler was solid, throwing 2,957 yards and 15 touchdowns, but his 16 interceptions and 59 percent completion rate were awful. The Texans accepted that they had made a huge mistake and got rid of the gargantuan quarterback. Osweiler only proved that the Texans were right to cut ties. At the age of 28, after bouncing around a bit more, Osweiler was ushered out of the league. However, before finding himself without a job, Osweiler attempted to revitalize his career by returning to Denver. Needless to say, it was a disaster.     Osweiler started four games back in his old stomping grounds but exhibited many of the same problems that have always plagued him. He would lose every game as the team\'s starter and completed only 55.8 percent of his passes. He was also not the best in the pocket, throwing five touchdowns and five interceptions. #5. Albert Haynesworth Denver Broncos v Washington Redskins As a Tennessee Titan, Albert Haynesworth was arguably the best defensive tackle in the NFL. In 2007 and 2008, Haynesworth truly stood out. He finished the year with 14.5 combined sacks and 91 combined tackles. His numbers resulted in back-to-back Pro-Bowl appearances and consecutive All-Pro berths.     Haynesworth\'s best seasons were rewarded with a ridiculous deal worth $100 million for seven years with the Washington Redskins. Ultimately, the financial ramifications were a tough pill to swallow. Still, Washington believed Haynesworth was a franchise-altering kind of player and one they needed to get themselves over the championship hump. Once Haynesworth got his money, his motivation went entirely out the window. He reached well over 300 pounds, appeared lethargic, and had uninspiring performances on the pitch. In year one, Haynesworth recorded just four sacks in 12 games. During the following season, they were done with him. He didn\'t start a single game before being shown the door the following year.

TB12 led the New England Patriots nine times to the Super Bowl, and he won six of them. He could have won seven Super Bowl titles when he was with the Pats; however, he failed to do so.        Super Bowl LII took place in February 2018 between the Patriots and the Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Even though Brady had a remarkable game, throwing for 505 yards and three touchdowns, his efforts were not enough to secure a victory for the Patriots.           In the second half, Tom Brady and his team faced a 10-point deficit. However, Brady led a comeback effort by throwing touchdown passes to Rob Gronkowski and Chris Hogan. The first touchdown pass helped narrow the gap, while the second one gave the Patriots a 33-32 lead with 9:22 remaining in the game. Despite Brady’s efforts to lead the Patriots to a victory, Nick Foles and the Eagles responded with a touchdown drive of their own. With the game on the line, Brady had the opportunity to engineer another iconic Super Bowl-winning drive. However, the Eagles’ defense had other plans. Brandon Graham’s strip-sack of Brady halted New England’s comeback attempt.     ""They\'re all pretty disappointing,"" Brady said, per Edward Lewis of NFL.com. ""I mean, losing sucks. But you show up and you try to win and sometimes you lose and that\'s the way it goes. ... It obviously—yup, it sucks."" The strip-sack forced the turnover and gave possession back to Philadelphia. The Patriots’ last chance to score ended with a failed Hail Mary attempt in their final position, sealing the Eagles’ victory. Tom Brady\'s last Super Bowl loss came against the Eagles Super Bowl LII - Philadelphia Eagles v New England Patriots     The 15-time Pro Bowler retired from the NFL in February 2023, after his 2022 season went lukewarm. He played with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2020 to 2022 and won his last Super Bowl ring with them. But his last Super Bowl loss came against Nick Foles and the Eagles. Many argue that Tom Brady\'s performance against Philadelphia was the best of his entire career, although it brought no success. His ability to rally his team and make crucial plays was instrumental in putting the Patriots in a position to potentially win the game.Although Tom Brady\'s comeback bid fell short, his legacy as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history remained intact. The game showcased the competitiveness and drama that often defines Super Bowl matchups.     ', ""Chicago might look to part ways with their veteran quarterback Nick Foles  Coming down the stretch of the 2017-18 NFL season, there was no hotter quarterback than the Philadelphia Eagles signal caller Nick Foles.   Filling in for an injured Carson Wentz, Nick Foles played outstanding football to lead the Eagles to the Super Bowl in February 2018. In the biggest game of his NFL career, Nick Foles went toe to toe with the legendary Tom Brady and did something only one other quarterback has been able to do.         He beat Brady in the big game, and his reputation as a clutch player took off in NFL circles.               The very next season with the Eagles, Nick Foles was starting to gain steam at the end of the year, leaving fans wondering if he could work his magic for a second straight campaign. He was nearly able to pull off another impressive run, but the team fell short in the divisional round against the New Orleans Saints.     Since his final game as an Eagle, the ensuing years for Nick Foles have been rocky, to say the least. He got a massive contract to leave the Eagles and sign with the Jacksonville Jaguars in March 2019.  However, from the very beginning of his tenure, it appeared like his time in Northern Florida was doomed to fail. In his first game with Jacksonville, Nick Foles broke his collarbone and was never able to get his footing. He didn’t win one game with the team. In March 2020, the veteran quarterback was traded to the Chicago Bears as insurance for incumbent starter Mitchell Trubisky. Nick Foles was not exactly an upgrade on Trubisky, as he went 2-5 in the seven games, he started for the Bears. As has seemingly been the question for the better part of 30 years in Chicago, what do the Bears do now? Should the team part ways with Nick Foles ahead of the 2021 season? Let's have a look at both sides of the argument.     Why should Chicago keep Nick Foles? While it can be argued that Nick Foles' performance late in the regular season and into the playoffs in his final two years with the Eagles was a fluke, he still has a formidable resume in the NFL’s biggest games.  There are many young quarterbacks—heck, even many veteran quarterbacks—who haven’t come close to sniffing the success Nick Foles has had in the postseason, even if it came largely in one year.  It might be wishful thinking to believe that it could happen again. But having Nick Foles on the roster, even as a reserve, could pay dividends if he can recapture his magic touch. Additionally, in 2020, Nick Foles played for a third team in as many seasons, and there’s a case to be made that annual change for a quarterback is about as detrimental to performance as a shoddy running game or a porous offensive line.      Even though his career stops have been linked to coaches under the Andy Reid tree, having to work with new coaches in three consecutive years can take its toll on a quarterback. Keeping Nick Foles around to develop another year of familiarity with head coach Matt Nagy and the Bears’ offensive philosophy could be mutually beneficial for both player and team.      Why should Chicago trade Nick Foles? His accomplishments during the Super Bowl cannot ever be taken away from him, but there’s a reason why Nick Foles has not been able to stick as a starting quarterback in the NFL.      While the hot streaks in his career have been awfully impressive, he usually comes crashing back down to earth. At this point, Nick Foles is two full seasons removed from his last stretch of effective play. And it’s fair to wonder whether he can ever get on a tear again. Head coach Matt Nagy simply cannot afford to give Nick Foles an unlimited amount of rope, considering the player's inconsistent track record. Another reason for Chicago to consider parting ways with Nick Foles now is the decent market he likely still has around the league.  Letting Nick Foles play in 2021 with the possibility of him struggling would all but kill his value. But at this point and time, there are probably still a few teams who would be interested in his services.  Nick Foles certainly has a familiarity with the coaching staff in Indianapolis and Kansas City. Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots also got a first-hand look at what he could do in the Super Bowl and could use another option at quarterback if Cam Newton falters.

Against the Vikings, Bray went 1-of-5 for 18 yards as the Bears tried to execute a comeback drive in what was ultimately a 19-13 loss.        Foles left the game with what was believed to be a hip/leg injury suffered after being thrown to the ground by Vikings defensive end Ifeadi Odenigbo.

Bears are on a bye and Foles will be day to day.— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) November 17, 2020  Will Foles stay at quarterback for the Chicago Bears? With Foles day-to-day heading into a bye week, the 5-5 Bears (currently the first team out of the NFC playoff picture) will have an opportunity to regroup and recalibrate their QB depth chart heading into the final stretch of the season.      Former No. 2 overall draft pick Trubisky opened the season atop the depth chart, but after 2.5 games (despite two Bears wins to open the year), Nagy turned to Foles. Trubisky, in three starts, averaged 140 yards per game, accounted for 6 total touchdowns and posted a 55.8 QBR.  Trubisky then suffered what was described by The Sporting News as a ""fluke shoulder injury,"" and has been unable to even back up Foles in recent weeks. Good news. Nick Foles did not suffer a major injury, according to @MikeGarafolo pic.twitter.com/jSMNCMk4QX— John Clark (@JClarkNBCS) November 17, 2020 “Coach made a decision that he felt was best for the team,” Trubisky told reporters after he was benched in Week 3.     After taking over, Foles -- who is best known for taking over at QB for the injured Carson Wentz and leading the Philadelphia Eagles to victory in Super Bowl LII -- has led the Chicago Bears to a 5-5 record, including four straight losses. Foles has averaged 231 yards per game and posted a 43.5 QBR to go with 10 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Coming out of the bye week, the Chicago Bears have key divisional matchups against the Vikings, Lions, and Packers on the schedule. The team also has injuries to its running backs, and top wide receiver Allen Robinson II may not be happy with his role. (Robinson\'s agent sent a frustrated tweet during the Bears-Vikings game.)Who coach Matt Nagy turns to at quarterback next could decide the fate of the Chicago Bears\' season.

However, it will be one and done as the team decided to cut the veteran signal-caller.   The move comes as quarterback Anthony Richardson, the team's top pick in this year's NFL Draft, practised at the team's rookie minicamp.        NFL fans wasted no time heading to Twitter to share their reaction to Foles being released by the Colts.

Foles completed 25 of 42 passes (59.5 completion percentage) for 224 yards, zero touchdowns, and four interceptions. Once Richardson was drafted, the quarterback room became a bit more crowded and Foles was a casualty. His release saved the Colts around $2 million.  How many seasons has Nick Foles played in his NFL career? Nick Foles     The former Arizona Wildcats quarterback finished his 11th season in the NFL in 2022. He started his journey when the Eagles took him in the 2014 NFL Draft, starting 24 total games in his first three seasons with Philadelphia. Foles started 11 games for the then-St. Louis Rams in the 2015 season and one game with the Kansas City Chiefs the following season. He would reunite with the Eagles ahead of the 2017 season as he took over for Carson Wentz late that season. Nick Foles would lead the Eagles to a Super Bowl 52 victory over the New England Patriots, winning Super Bowl MVP. The Pro Bowler would spend one more season with Philadelphia before moving on to the Jacksonville Jaguars in free agency. However, the 34-year-old would only start four games with the Jaguars due to suffering a broken left collarbone injury. Jacksonville would trade Foles to the Chicago Bears prior to the 2020 season. He would start eight games for the Bears in two seasons.     In all, Nick Foles has thrown for 14,227 yards, 82 touchdowns, and 47 interceptions in 71 career games. Time will tell where Foles will land this offseason for his 12th season.     "", ""NFL: 5 takeaways from the Tennessee Titans' Week 9 win over the Chicago Bears  The Tennessee Titans came into Sunday's game against the Chicago Bears tied with the Indianapolis Colts atop the AFC South.  Ryan Tannehill has put together a great season at quarterback for the Titans. He has relied a lot on running back Derrick Henry.        The Tennessee Titans needed a win to take a step closer to winning the division and making another appearance in the playoffs. The Titans and Colts are getting ready to meet up in Week 10. The Colts lost their game against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday to drop to 5-3.           With the Titans' 24-17 win over the Bears, they improved to 6-2 and now sit alone on top of the division.  5. The Bears need to put everything together at the same time Chicago received a stellar performance from quarterback Nick Foles. Foles threw for two touchdowns and did not throw an interception. The problem was that their running game did not match Foles' performance on Sunday. The Chicago Bears currently rank last in rushing yards per game in the NFL. They're not giving their quarterback or wide receivers help at all when it comes to offensive production. Bears running back David Montgomery is very inconsistent and if they want to help anyone who is going to play quarterback, they need him to improve.      4. Titans RB Derrick Henry was held without a touchdown The Tennessee Titans offense needs Derrick Henry to set the tone of the football game. Their offensive production relies solely on his production. The Titans use the running game to set up their passing offense. The Chicago Bears drew up the perfect plan. They held Derrick Henry in check throughout this game. Henry carried the football 21 times for 68 yards, but he did not touch the end zone. The Bears defense kept Henry from making an impactful play during the game. The Tennessee Titans needed their QB Ryan Tannehill to lead them to victory over Chicago. Derrick Henry did just enough to help Tannehill and the Titans. Tennessee got back on the winning side and Tannehill is to thank for that.  3. The Chicago Bears' losing streak continues The Chicago Bears have dropped three straight games. In those three games only one was decided by two possessions. The losing streak that the Chicago Bears are on right now is in the lap of their offense. The Bears running game is not producing, which is putting more pressure on their receivers and quarterbacks.     The Chicago Bears defense has done everything they could to keep them in football games. They just needed a little help from the offense to get over the hump. Chicago has a chance to end the losing streak next week against the Minnesota Vikings, but they will need more offensive production for that to happen.  2. The Bears' defense has kept them in every game this season Chicago relies solely on their defense to keep them in games. This may seem like a no-brainer for any team, but Chicago goes above and beyond. The Bears struggle offensively on third down and put their defense in tough situations throughout games. The 2020 Chicago Bears pic.twitter.com/JrCIFkjnst— WOLFE 🧸 (@WhatsWolfe) November 8, 2020     Through Week 9 of the season, the Chicago Bears are 5-4. In their nine games, eight have been decided by one possession. The credit for Chicago's five wins needs to be given to the defense. They have been put in situations that make them bail out the offense of the Chicago Bears. If the Bears want to be successful they need to fix their offensive issues.  1. The AFC South could be decided in the next three weeks The Titans and Colts will meet up twice in the next three weeks. The Titans currently have a one-game lead over the Colts with their win this weekend. The Titans are heading into a three-game stretch that could not only determine the AFC South but their chances in the playoffs. Back On Track ⚔️ #TitanUp pic.twitter.com/hOvOiCdma6— Ryan Tannehill (@ryantannehill1) November 9, 2020     Tennessee will welcome the Colts this Sunday in a game that could put them two games ahead of Indianapolis if they can win. After playing the Colts at home, the Titans will travel to Baltimore to play the Ravens in a rematch from last years playoffs. Let's say they beat the Colts and lose to the Ravens. This would set up a huge game between the Colts and Titans in Week 12. The Tennessee Titans will need Derrick Henry to get off to a fast start against Indianapolis on Sunday to get the offense clicking. The best-case scenario is that the Titans win the two against the Colts and lose to the Ravens. This would still put them in a great spot to win the AFC South and make another trip to the playoffs. Either way, the Titans have proven this year that they're looking to make a big playoff run.     "", 'How did Nick Foles get his NSFW nickname? Here’s how Colts QB got unusual moniker in locker room  Nick Foles will be remembered by Philadelphia Eagles fans for the ""Philly Special"" in Super Bowl 52 but other fans know him for his nickname. While with the Eagles, Foles got the nickname Big D**k Nick (BDN) from then-teammate and linebacker Conor Barwin.  Barwin did a Reddit AMA in 2014 where he answered questions from fans. The linebacker was able to choose which questions to answer and somehow the size of the players ""weiners"" were asked.        This was the question asked in that AMA:              Here is the response in the thread answered by Barwin:        What adds to the legend of the nickname is that interaction is a question that was answered on the official Eagles Reddit account. It gave off the impression as though the team was making that statement. Along with Barwin\'s assertion, Deadspin also added in a 2018 blog post that Foles had the BDN nickname while at the University of Arizona. Deadspin said the Indianapolis Colts quarterback also picked up the nickname ""Footlong Foles"" while at Arizona. Yet, it\'s difficult to know how genuine these claims are.

56,Tom Brady,"['“It sucks”- Tom Brady once got candid about devastating Super Bowl LII loss to Eagles despite historic performance  Tom Brady once opened up about his true feelings when he lost Super Bowl LII as a New England Patriots quarterback against the Philadelphia Eagles.  TB12 led the New England Patriots nine times to the Super Bowl, and he won six of them. He could have won seven Super Bowl titles when he was with the Pats; however, he failed to do so.        Super Bowl LII took place in February 2018 between the Patriots and the Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Even though Brady had a remarkable game, throwing for 505 yards and three touchdowns, his efforts were not enough to secure a victory for the Patriots.           In the second half, Tom Brady and his team faced a 10-point deficit. However, Brady led a comeback effort by throwing touchdown passes to Rob Gronkowski and Chris Hogan. The first touchdown pass helped narrow the gap, while the second one gave the Patriots a 33-32 lead with 9:22 remaining in the game. Despite Brady’s efforts to lead the Patriots to a victory, Nick Foles and the Eagles responded with a touchdown drive of their own. With the game on the line, Brady had the opportunity to engineer another iconic Super Bowl-winning drive. However, the Eagles’ defense had other plans. Brandon Graham’s strip-sack of Brady halted New England’s comeback attempt.     ""They\'re all pretty disappointing,"" Brady said, per Edward Lewis of NFL.com. ""I mean, losing sucks. But you show up and you try to win and sometimes you lose and that\'s the way it goes. ... It obviously—yup, it sucks."" The strip-sack forced the turnover and gave possession back to Philadelphia. The Patriots’ last chance to score ended with a failed Hail Mary attempt in their final position, sealing the Eagles’ victory. Tom Brady\'s last Super Bowl loss came against the Eagles Super Bowl LII - Philadelphia Eagles v New England Patriots     The 15-time Pro Bowler retired from the NFL in February 2023, after his 2022 season went lukewarm. He played with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2020 to 2022 and won his last Super Bowl ring with them. But his last Super Bowl loss came against Nick Foles and the Eagles. Many argue that Tom Brady\'s performance against Philadelphia was the best of his entire career, although it brought no success. His ability to rally his team and make crucial plays was instrumental in putting the Patriots in a position to potentially win the game.Although Tom Brady\'s comeback bid fell short, his legacy as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history remained intact. The game showcased the competitiveness and drama that often defines Super Bowl matchups.

October 18, 2009, however, would quickly become a day to remember for the GOAT and a nightmare-fueled memory for Tennessee Titans fans. The New England Patriots would record a 59-0 win over the Titans, the NFL\'s biggest blowout ever.

Perhaps, the Titans had a chance. That would quickly end as Tom Brady threw two touchdown passes to wide receiver Randy Moss within a minute. Titans quarterback Vince Young threw an interception shortly afterward which, of course, resulted in yet another Patriots touchdown.           Tom Brady threw touchdown passes within the two-minute warning to wide receiver Wes Welker to make it 45-0 at halftime. Brady would surprisingly still play in the third quarter as he threw his final touchdown pass of the day to Moss. Backup quarterback Brian Hoyer would finally sub in for Brady and grab the final touchdown of the day as NFL history was made at the expense of the Tennesse Titans. Tom Brady would finish 29/34, 380 yards, and six touchdown passes, somehow not enough for a perfect passer rating. Welker would finish with 150 yards and two touchdowns, while Moss would have to settle for 129 yards and three TDs.      The Patriots would be beaten in the AFC wild card by the Baltimore Ravens as the Indianapolis Colts would go on to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl. Tom Brady owns every quarterback stat ever Super Bowl LV No team in NFL history has ever won seven Super Bowls; however, a player has, and that man is Tom Brady. Brady would win six rings alongside Belichick, and the quarterback would prove he did not need Belichick when he brought a Super Bowl win home to Tampa. He has five Super Bowl MVPs and three regular-season MVPs.     Brady has the most passing yards (89,214) and the most touchdown passes ever (649), His records are secure for years to come. Patrick Mahomes is having an amazing NFL career so far, but he would probably have to play into his mid-40s to trouble Brady\'s records.Tom Brady is the NFL\'s undisputed GOAT.

At six foot eight inches and 250 lbs., James is built like an NFL player in every way, and last year and during the NBA lockout in 2011, it could have been a reality. In an appearance on ManningCast, the Monday Night Football alternative with brothers Peyton Manning and Eli Manning, the four-time NBA MVP disclosed that the two teams offered him a contract. He told the Manning Brothers on the Week Three telecast:  “[Cowboys owner] Jerry Jones offered me a contract. Also [Seahawks coach] Pete Carroll did as well in Seattle during our lockout time.”        What most fans may not know about the 17-time NBA All-Star is that James had a great football career at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was a first-team all-state wide receiver, playing in his sophomore and junior years. In his two-year high school football career, James had 103 catches, 2,065 receiving yards and 23 touchdowns.

However, in an alternate universe, if he did decide to sign with the Dallas Cowboys or Seattle Seahawks, James might have faced Brady. Yet that didn\'t stop James from watching his greatness from afar as he did versus the Atlanta Falcons.     James compliments Brady\'s performance Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady In the second quarter of the Buccaneers game versus the Atlanta Falcons in Week 13, Tom Brady engineered a 12 play, 85-yard drive that took three minutes and 45 seconds. On that drive, the 14-time Pro Bowl quarterback went five of seven for 67 yards, ending with a 27-yard touchdown to tight end Rob Gronkowski to go up 20-10. James was so impressed that he tweeted that he could watch Brady engineer an offense, saying:     “It’s so beautiful” It is always a great time to see greatness acknowledging greatness and this is a great example of King James and the GOAT. Like James, we are all in awe of Brady and can still lead a team at age 44 with such poise.

During Monday\'s episode of Undisputed on FS1, Sharpe was highly critical of Brady\'s performance, calling out the quarterback for his poor performance while passing the ball. Brady completed only 34 of his 55 pass attempts for 253 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.         Tom Brady debate sparks petty argument between Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe           Bayless offered poor retorts to Sharpe\'s legitimate criticism of Tom Brady\'s performance, before accusing the NFL Hall of Famer of being jealous of the seven-time Super Bowl champion. When Sharpe called out Bayless for claiming that Brady watches more film than the Buccaneers coaching staff and that the quarterback was the one to blame for the team\'s blowout loss against the 49ers, the latter responded: ""This is straight hate by a guy who is jealous that he\'s still playing at a high level at 45, when you [Sharpe] had to stop at 35. That\'s the point."" Sharpe replied: ""Skip, that\'s what you do. Every time I call something into question, [you claim] I am jealous. I did what I did. You make it sound like I was a bum. I\'m in the NFL Hall of Fame. I got three Super Bowls.""     Bayless snapped back: ""So what? [Brady\'s] way better than you were!"" A visibly upset Sharpe took his glasses off and continued to argue his case: ""You are willing to take a personal shot at me. To say this man is better than me because I said he\'s playing bad this year?"" Watch the entire argument below:     Bayless responded that Sharpe\'s comments about Tom Brady were disrespectful and the former NFL star responded that the veteran analyst\'s jibe at him was just as disrespectful. The argument eventually cooled down after Sharpe took a backseat and allowed Bayless to make his case and defend Brady\'s performance against the 49ers. What started off as a passionate debate devolved into a petty argument.      ', ""Tom Brady doesn't mince words about Buccaneers' poor performance in loss against Packers  For any other person to lose a game is normal; for Tom Brady it is exceptional because he rarely loses. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers lost 14-12 to the Green Bay Packers and Tom Brady was largely anonymous during the game. In the first three quarters, he could not lead his team to a single touchdown, whereas his counterpart Aaron Rodgers had two touchdowns of his own.            In the final few minutes of the game, we saw the vintage Tom Brady rise again when he led them to a 91 yard drive for a touchdown with just 14 seconds remaining. They elected to tie the game with a two-point conversion. However, they first faced a delay of game penalty after taking too long and then a failed attempt erased their chances of a comeback.           As the team's leader, Brady was not impressed and put his hand up for the loss. He tweeted that they had to be better and that he was ready to go again this coming Sunday. Considering they play Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs next at home, they would have to be at their best to stand a chance of winning. Tom Brady@TomBradyGotta be better, we'll be ready to go Sunday. @Buccaneers16404778Gotta be better, we'll be ready to go Sunday. @Buccaneers https://t.co/5bKBFhol9S     Tom Brady first to put his hand up after the game His tweet reflects his feelings from right after the game. The two-point conversion became needlessly difficult after he and his offense were unmindful of the clock. Another thing that he would have noticed as well is that they were very lucky that the touchdown pass was allowed to stand. The replay showed the clock expired before Tampa Bay got the snap off.         Such poor execution cannot be tolerated by those with designs to win another Super Bowl. Tom Brady said the same after the game when he contended that it was the execution on the part of the offense that had let the team down. Scott Smith@ScottSBucsTom Brady says there were too many plays tonight with poor execution on offense in today’s game. “Our job is to go out there and score points. We’re not going to do that with poor execution.”363Tom Brady says there were too many plays tonight with poor execution on offense in today’s game. “Our job is to go out there and score points. We’re not going to do that with poor execution.” Brady has been nowhere close to his best this season and the offense's highest score this season has been 20 points against the New Orleans Saints. He does not feature among stats leaders in passing and touchdowns, which is a marked turnaround from last year when he led in those categories.But if there is one person who can never be written off, it is Tom Brady. Considering how aware he is of improving himself and always willing to take responsibility, it would be foolish to rule him out of contention.     "", ""New Orleans Saints stop Tom Brady in defensive performance  Tom Brady has had an epic career, as well as an epic start to the 2021-2022 NFL season. But that all came to a crashing halt during last night's jaw-dropping shutout loss to the New Orleans Saints by a score of 9-0.  Although the Saints' offense was also limited by an offense quarterbacked by Taysom Hill and without head coach Sean Payton, out because of testing positive for COVID, their defense did what it typically does against Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which baffles them beyond epic proportions.        Tampa Bay Buccaneers@BuccaneersGoing to come back better.#GoBucs12:30 PM · Dec 20, 202135231Going to come back better.#GoBucs           The Saints were able to pull off a defensive performance for the ages against the NFL's highest scoring offense. Tom Brady was held in check against the Saints in a performance not replicated in 15 years New Orleans Saints v Tampa Bay Buccaneers     On Sunday Night Football, the New Orleans Saints did the unthinkable: limit Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers offense to zero points for the entire game. This feat has not been done to Tom Brady in 15 years, since the Miami Dolphins shut out Brady's New England Patriots by a score of 21-0. As an aside, the head coach of those 2006 Miami Dolphins was none other than Nick Saban, the current head coach and conductor of the University of Alabama's college football dynasty. Saban is also a disciple of Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, so perhaps it's not that much of a surprise that it was that team that last shut out Brady. The record for a quarterback not being shut out in an NFL game currently sits at 255 games and is held by former New Orleans Saints quarterback and current NBC Sunday Night Football analyst Drew Brees. Ironically, it was Brees's former team that did a number on Brady and the Buccaneers' offense. The front four constantly sent pressure and collapsed the pocket around Brady, which is universally known as kryptonite for the seven-time Super Bowl champion.     And not to take away from a great defensive game from the Saints' defense, but during the course of the game, the Buccaneers also lost receivers Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and running back Leonard Fournette. Ian Rapoport@RapSheet#Bucs WR Chris Godwin, who suffered an MCL sprain, is expected to miss the rest of the regular season, source said. With three games left, Injured Reserve makes sense.

With three games left, Injured Reserve makes sense. Godwin should be able to return for the playoffs, which obviously is most important. The outlook for the Buccaneers may appear bleak after shooting blanks against the Saints. But they hope to have Godwin back for the playoffs and also look forward to the return of Antonio Brown, who has been suspended for the past three games for misrepresenting his COVID vaccination status by allegedly using a fake vaccination card.     And although Sunday wasn't his best game, it never hurts to have Tom Brady on your side when the chips are down.Also Read: What happened to Buccaneers WR Chris Godwin?

The Cowboys were held to just three points and were the only team in Week 1 not to score a touchdown.  Prescott looked like a quarterback who had not played any proper football for months, and it showed as he completed 14 of his 29 passes for 134 yards and an interception. Bayless was not happy with what he saw from the Cowboys signal-caller and slammed him for his performance on Undisputed.        “Did I overestimate the fourth-round pick? Who plays occasionally like he’s the fourth-overall pick, but too often he plays like a fourth-round pick. The other night, he played like a seventh-round pick to me.""              “Dak stunk it up and its why I can’t get all bent out of shape for losing Dak Prescott. I have been up and down on him since he was drafted in the fourth-round.”     After Prescott\'s injury that will see him sidelined for at least four weeks, back-up Cooper Rush will be tasked with keeping the Cowboys\' season alive until No. 4 returns.  Dak Prescott struggles in Cowboys\' season opener Dak Prescott (under helmet) during the Cowboys\' season-opening game It was hard on the eyes and even harder for Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night. The Tampa Bay defense, led by Todd Bowles, made life very difficult for the Cowboys offense.        The game started brightly for Dallas as they drove down the field and scored what would be their only points of the game. After that, it was tough sledding for Dallas as their receivers simply could not get open. Prescott often forced the ball into tight coverage and was lucky not to be picked off more than once. The Buccaneers held Dallas to 3/15 on third down as the offense could not move the ball at all and kept the home side to 2/5 on fourth down. They also kept the Cowboys offense to just 3.8 yards per play.

', ""Tom Brady left in awe of Kelsey Plum after Las Vegas Aces star's record-breaking 40-point performance  It takes a lot to get the attention of former NFL quarterback and surefire Hall of Famer Tom Brady, but Las Vegas Aces basketball star Kelsey Plum has done just that.  With the WNBA season in full swing, the Aces (17-2) are rolling, including a 113-89 win over the Minnesota Lynx. The 24-point win was never in doubt as the Aces added to their advantage after each quarter.        But the biggest thing to come out of the game was Plum's incredible performance, as she dropped 40 points in just 31 minutes. She also had two rebounds and four assists, and Brady took notice of her efforts, sharing her game on his Instagram story.           Brady loves Plum's performance. In addition to her amazing performance, Plum also became the first player in franchise history to post a 40-point game. Per Sports Illustrated, Plum's previous high for points in a game was 26. Well, she smashed that against the Lynx.     In her 40-point effort, she also posted six 3-point shots while shooting 14-for-18. Putting it simply, Plum was unstoppable, and Tom Brady loved it.  Tom Brady's ownership stake in the Las Vegas Aces one of many off-field deals Brady, right, at the Connecticut Sky vs. Las Vegas Aces game. While Plum's efforts were superb, we think that Brady loved it twice as much, seeing as he has an ownership stake in the Aces. It is just one of Tom Brady's many off-field moves, and this one is, for some, one of his best yet.        Brady has other irons in the fire, of course, with his BradyBrand clothing line, his NFT business called Autograph and his TB12 Method still doing well.        While his on-field efforts are out of this world, Brady's off-field ones are just as good, and he is starting his 10-year contract with Fox Sports in 2024 as he makes a move to the broadcast booth.All in all, Tom Brady isn't slacking off since he retired, and he is clearly loving his life right now, even more so after Plum's 40-point effort.     "", 'NFL analyst dissects reason for Tom Brady\'s poor showing in 2022 NFL season  Tom Brady has made an uneven start to the NFL season and Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe thinks he knows why. Despite being 2-0 on the season, Tampa Bay has looked shaky on offense with Brady not looking like his usual self.  On Fox Sports\' Undisputed, Sharpe and Skip Bayless were discussing the Buccaneers\' start to the season and Brady\'s performances in the opening two games.         Sharpe made the case that Tom Brady\'s weapons are not what they used to be, and given that some of his teammates are out injured, he needs more help than ever.           “The thing is, they need bodies. Mike Evans could potentially be suspended a game. They’re not going to have Godwin. They do believe they are going to get Godwin sometime in the near future, they just don’t know when.  ""Julio, we don’t know the extent of that injury, so we don’t know how long, but he might be back this week, it might be three or four weeks. So, you\'re kind of running out of receiver bodies Skip.        “I mean you got Gage, you got Perriman, you got Scotty Miller, I think you maybe got one other receiver, you probably only dress six or seven receivers. But here’s my thing Skip, the only thing I have said is that as Tom has gotten older, he needs help around him, he needs better players around him, you have to get better players around him.”  Is Tom Brady showing signs of decline? Tom Brady in Tampa Bay Buccaneers v New Orleans Saints match     For a quarterback who is 45 years old, it is natural to expect some sort of decline, right? But we are talking about the \'GOAT\' here, he is no ordinary 45-year-old. During the first two games of the year, Tom Brady has only thrown for 402 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception.    His completion percentage is 59% and he is averaging only 6.6 yards per attempt. It is only two games, but the seven-time Super Bowl champ is off to a slow start. Are there alarm bells ringing in Tampa Bay? Probably not, as they are 2-0.     With the offense struggling, they have still found a way to win both games, which surely bodes well for when Brady finds his rhythm. Some have pointed to his off-field issues with his wife Gisele as a reason for his poor performances.    It is hard to imagine that his off-field issues haven\'t had some sort of impact on his game. We will likely never know, but TB12 certainly does not seem like his usual self in the opening weeks of the NFL season.     Is it to do with his lack of receivers or his marriage troubles? Who knows, but one thing is for certain, he isn\'t himself on the football field.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Fox Sports\' Undisupted and H/T Sportskeeda.     ']"

Here's why both teams should be competing to get the quarterback this summer.            #1 CJ Beathard's Week-Two performance For those who made it to the end of the Monday Night Football broadcast, they were rewarded with an offensive explosion. CJ Beathard came into the game down multiple possessions, and ended the game with a two-point deficit. Beathard went nine for 14, and threw for 121 yards and two touchdowns in about half a quarter. Jaguars QB Competition Update:CJ Beathard: 13/16, 102 yds, 1 TD, 0 sacksTrevor Lawrence: 6/9, 71 yds, 0 TD, 2 sacksNumbers don't lie #Hawkeyes pic.twitter.com/GlCtdxFQmc— Barstool Hawkeyes (@BarstoolUIowa) August 22, 2021 Before Beathard, the Jaguars had scored three points. Beathard helped the Jaguars score 18 points in the fourth quarter. No backup Ravens or Cowboys quarterback has been able to come anywhere close to that type of performance.      #2 CJ Beathard's experience While the Cowboys and Ravens' backups have all barely seen the field during the regular season, CJ Beathard has started 12 games in the NFL.  Any NFL experience is good experience. The more experience a quarterback has, the more comfortable they are while running an NFL offense in the heat of the game and the higher the chances of a good output from the team.     12 games of experience is a massive gap early in a player's career. 12 games is almost a full rookie season. Basically, CJ Beathard has already almost completed a rookie season in the NFL. It could take the Ravens and Cowboys' backups years to get this number of starts as a backup. However, with Beathard, the growing pains are largely done.      #3 CJ Beathard has been on the up Jacksonville Jaguars Training Camp CJ Beathard admittedly started slow early in his career. He was 1-9 in his first ten games. However, since then, he has been on the up, going 1-1. 2020 saw him throw for six touchdowns and zero interceptions. It is unclear what lit the fire under Beathard.That said, after his Week Two performance on Monday Night Football and his 2020 stats, CJ Beathard looks like a ship poised for takeoff. If the Cowboys or Ravens do land him, they might be surprised with what they got.     "", ""Jacksonville Jaguars vs Dallas Cowboys Prediction & Preview - August 29, 2021 | NFL preseason 2021  In the final game of their 2021 NFL preseason campaign, the Jacksonville Jaguars will square off against the Dallas Cowboys. At the end of the game, both teams' next games will count, as that would mean the start of the regular season. Which team will end their preseason on a high note?  Match Details        Fixture - Jacksonville Jaguars vs Dallas Cowboys | 2021 NFL Preseason.           Date & Time - Sunday, August 29th, 1:00 PM ET. Venue - AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas.  Jacksonville Jaguars Preview The Jacksonville Jaguars would love an easy win, but their biggest objective in the game will be to help narrow down their roster. For the coaches, they will hope to have a better idea of the 53 players who'll make up the roster after they walk out of the stadium. Meanwhile, fringe players will hope to make a mark to force themselves into reckoning.  Key Player - CJ Beathard Trevor Lawrence may see some time this week, but it will be up to CJ Beathard to take the team home. Last week, Beathard helped a stagnant Jaguars offense explode for 18 points in the fourth quarter against the New Orleans Saints. For the Jaguars to win this game, Beathard will need to have another strong performance. Last week, he threw for 121 yards and two touchdowns.     CJ Beathard is balling tonight...— Keiana Martin (@KeianaMartinTV) August 24, 2021  Jacksonville Jaguars Predicted Lineup Quarterback - Trevor Lawrence, CJ Beathard.

Dallas Cowboys Preview Houston Texans vs Dallas Cowboys     The Cowboys are nearing the end of their stint with HBO's 'Hard Knocks'. With the end of that comes the start of the regular season. The Cowboys will have the shortest break, as they will be playing in the season opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. So they'll want to end the preseason on a good note. A good note for the Cowboys would be a win and finding out who their backup quarterback will be this season. Going into Week Three, none of their three options has pulled away as the obvious winner. So time is running out for the Cowboys. Without an obvious winner, the Cowboys could be rolling the dice and praying for Prescott to stay healthy this year.  Key Player - Ben DiNucci Dallas Cowboys vs Pittsburgh Steelers     Based on 'Hard Knocks', it seems the Cowboys are subtly pulling for Ben DiNucci to win the competition. However, after a three-interception performance, the odds of him winning the starting job are slim. Cooper Rush played the best last week, throwing for two touchdowns. If Ben DiNucci doesn't have a big game this week and Cooper Rush doesn't fall to pieces, he might win the job by heating up at the right time.  Dallas Cowboys Predicted Lineup Quarterback - Cooper Rush, Garrett Gilbert, Ben DiNucci. Running back - Tony Pollard, JaQuan Hardy, Brenden Knox. WR - Cedrick Wilson, Johnnie Dixon, Noah Brown, Aaron Parker, Osirus Mitchell, Michael Gallup, Simi Fehoko, Reggie Davis, Brandon Smith. TE - Blake Jarwin, Dalton Schultz, Jeremy Sprinkle.

Jaguars vs Cowboys Match Prediction It was not too long ago that CJ Beathard was a starter in the NFL. He should be able to remind the world of that if he scores against the Dallas Cowboys at will. Expect the Cowboys to struggle to move the ball and lose by multiple scores.         Where to watch Jaguars vs Cowboys?The game will be broadcast on NFL Network.

"", ""Fantasy Football: 49ers at Cardinals picks for Week 16  An NFC West bout is one of the NFL's major Week 16 matchups, and it could be just as crucial for fantasy owners.  The San Francisco 49ers (5-9) travel to face the Arizona Cardinals (8-6) on Saturday, with the game featuring multiple players that could make or break fantasy football teams during what, for many, is championship week.                   49ers at Cardinals fantasy football: Start 'em Cardinals QB Kyler Murray At first glance, this doesn't look like a favorable matchup for Murray; the 49ers are the No. 10 defense against opposing quarterbacks, according to NFL.com Fantasy rankings. But that doesn't tell the whole story. Murray is currently the No. 1 overall fantasy quarterback, and he's coming off a 406-yard, three-touchdown performance against the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles are the No. 16 overall defense, just six spots behind the 49ers, so Murray has proven such defensive rankings don't mean much for his on-field showings. Kyler Murray sets NFL record with TD pass, TD run vs. #Eagles📰: https://t.co/58sxvshscV | #RedSea pic.twitter.com/nGjCoVLbA8— TheCardsWire (@Cards_Wire) December 20, 2020      49ers RB Jeff Wilson Wilson isn't always a top-option for the 49ers, but fellow tailback Raheem Mostert is on injured reserve, opening up opportunities for Wilson. He suffered an ankle injury during last week's game against the Dallas Cowboys, but he's not listed on the injury report. Despite his ranking as the No. 49 overall fantasy running back, Wilson should be in line to be San Francisco's top runner on Saturday, and fantasy owners should cash in on his newfound opportunity for some key championship-week points.  49ers at Cardinals fantasy football: Sit 'em 49ers TE George Kittle Kittle is expected to return to action Saturday after serving time on injured reserve. With former Iowa teammate C.J. Beathard getting the start at quarterback and Kittle's prowess as arguably the NFL's best tight end, it would be easy to plug him into a fantasy lineup in the hopes he provides a spark.     That wouldn't be smart, though. Kittle is coming off a foot injury that's sidelined him for a while, and while head coach Kyle Shanahan cited him as healthy, he won't want to overuse him and risk re-aggravating the injury. Plus, starting a player fresh off injured reserve is always an incredibly risky proposition, as players, even ones as good as Kittle, usually need time to readjust. #49ers Star TE George Kittle WILL play Saturday vs Cardinals, Kyle Shanahan said in his zoom press conference. Said he felt “great” and that he’ll be on somewhat of a pitch count. Shanahan said Kittle is one of the healthiest players they have.— Omar Ruiz (@OmarDRuiz) December 24, 2020 Cardinals K Mike Nugent After spending much of the season on the practice squad, Nugent kicked the last two weeks in place of Zane Gonzalez, who's out for the rest of the season. He hit four field goals against the Giants and one against the Eagles, and many fantasy owners might look to add him, as he's likely now owned in most leagues. But kickers thrive on consistent opportunities; sitting for weeks, then playing, plus being moved back and forth from the practice squad, is a recipe for disaster. There are many better kicking options available for fantasy owners, as it's typically not hard to add a decent kicker from free agency. Let Nugent get more reps in before even considering starting him.     "", ""Luis Perez NFL Potential: 3 Teams that should target XFL Championship MVP  The XFL Championship saw a star born in Luis Perez. The quarterback was excellent in guiding his 8.5-point underdog Arlington Renegades over the D.C. Defenders. Perez, who won XFL Championship MVP, and head coach Bob Stoops were on point last night.  Perez tossed three touchdowns while completing 26/36 passes for 288 yards. He had no interceptions and added 10 yards on the ground, too. With a performance like this under his belt, NFL teams may take notice. Here's which ones should give him a shot at the next level.                   The Jacksonville Jaguars could use Luis Perez XFL@XFL2023Someone called Sal  41-yard TD makes it 6-0 for the @XFLRenegades #XFL | #XFLChampionship61291Someone called Sal 👀 41-yard TD makes it 6-0 for the @XFLRenegades #XFL | #XFLChampionship https://t.co/4LTI8etw31 The Jacksonville Jaguars have Trevor Lawrence, so there'd be no need for Luis Perez to play. However, he might be a better backup than CJ Beathard. Plus, if Perez is ever going to become an NFL quarterback, Lawrence is a great person to play behind and learn from. For both parties, this could be a fruitful partnership that's certainly worth looking into.      The Las Vegas Raiders make sense Where could Luis Perez go? The Las Vegas Raiders make a lot of sense for Perez, too. Jimmy Garoppolo feels like a long-term bridge quarterback and they passed on drafting his replacement in the 2023 NFL Draft.  Could Perez, who is three years younger than Garoppolo, be a more long-term solution for the franchise after his Championship win? Possibly, and it wouldn't hurt to let him learn from the two-time Super Bowl champion who has now been on three teams.      The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are best suited for Luis Perez    The Tampa Bay Buccaneers currently feature a quarterback room of Kyle Trask and Baker Mayfield. That is not something that inspires a lot of hope with the fans, but if there's a team that Perez might actually get playing time with, it's probably the Buccaneers. He's a long shot to play anywhere since the competition at the NFL level is far better than at the XFL level, but the Buccaneers don't have a lot of great options. They could be Perez's shot at making it like PJ Walker before him. He's probably going to be a backup wherever he goes, but there's a quarterback battle going on in Tampa already, so why not join?     "", 'Why Trevor Lawrence isn\'t Urban Meyer\'s first choice QB for the Jacksonville Jaguars yet?  When the Jacksonville Jaguars drafted quarterback Trevor Lawrence with the first overall pick, he seemed to be the team\'s incumbent starting quarterback.   With other options featuring the likes of former starter Gardner Minshew II and journeyman quarterback C.J. Beathard, it seemed that the Jaguars were planning on starting Lawrence in Week 1.        NFL teams don\'t usually draft a quarterback with the first overall pick and bench him unless there\'s a veteran on the team who is on the verge of retirement. But with that not being the case with the Jaguars, the team\'s new head coach, Urban Meyer, refusing to name Lawrence as the starter was a head-scratcher.           Why hasn\'t Trevor Lawrence been named the Jaguars starting QB yet? Jacksonville Jaguars passing game coordinator Brian Schottenheimer was quoted as saying last week that the team ""wasn\'t in a position"" to name a starting quarterback before training camp. He went on to say that Lawrence was learning the playbook well and progressing in the right direction. This week, head coach Urban Meyer did an interview on \'Sports Seriously\' with USA Today\'s Mackenzie Salmon. He elaborated on why he and his coaching staff haven\'t officially announced Trevor Lawrence as the starter yet. He said:     ""He\'s not ready yet, but he doesn\'t have to be ready yet,"" Meyer said. ""We got a long training camp coming up. He\'s probably advanced maybe a little quicker than we would\'ve thought, so which was a positive. One thing that we worked on — when we made a decision that Trevor was going to be our No. 1 pick, we went from the evaluation stage to the preparation stage. And that means that I want to see — I can\'t remember the exact date, but we started installing the playbook with him well before the draft. So you can see the retention, he\'s got a really good work ethic and he\'s progressed very well."" Meyer further added that he drafted Trevor Lawrence because he was extremely impressed with his performance at Clemson. He said that he also knows Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney quite well and that he knew that Lawrence\'s character and work ethic would be something he wanted for the Jaguars team as a whole.      Urban Meyer: Trevor Lawrence \'not ready yet\' https://t.co/eTXH45GS5o— NBC Sports EDGE Football (@NBCSEdgeFB) June 25, 2021 Meyer feels that as the new head coach of the Jaguars he needs to give each of the quarterbacks, Lawrence, Minshew, Beathard and Jake Luton, a fair opportunity in training camp to compete for the position. Meyer doesn\'t want to throw a rookie like Lawrence into the starting quarterback position if he isn\'t completely ready to do so. While Lawrence seems pro-ready, there will be a slight learning curve in the transition from college football to the NFL. Learning the playbook is something that Lawrence is already doing and seems to be doing quite well.     Urban Meyer on Trevor Lawrence\'s development: ""He\'s not ready yet"" https://t.co/G4Qwzd6csw— Clemson_Tigers (@Clemson_Tigers) June 26, 2021Even with a healthy quarterback competition in training camp, the odds still seem to be in Trevor Lawrence\'s favor and he will likely be named the starting quarterback for Week 1.     ', '5 best landing spots for Gardner Minshew\xa0  Gardner Minshew was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the sixth round of the 2019 NFL Draft. At the time, he was considered the future quarterback of the franchise, but it seems that time has come and gone.  In 2019, Gardner Minshew became the starting quarterback after Nick Foles was injured in Week 1 of the season. Minshew went on to appear in 14 games, starting 12, throwing for 3,271 yards and 21 touchdowns.        Before the 2020 season, Foles was traded, making Gardner Minshew the starting quarterback for the Jaguars. After Minshew sustained injuries, Mike Glennon and Jake Luton received opportunities to start. When Gardner Minshew returned, the Jaguars weren\'t happy with his performance and replaced him in Week 15 with Mike Glennon.           The Jaguars have now drafted their new starting quarterback,Trevor Lawrence. The team signed former San Francisco 49ers backup C.J. Beathard as the backup, while Jake Luton would be third in the depth chart. That puts Gardner Minshew the odd man out, and the Jacksonville Jaguars are interested in trading him. On that note, let\'s have a look at five NFL teams that could be a good fit for Minshew. Frangie Show: Gardner Minshew was not at #Jaguars voluntary OTAs today. Urban Meyer said he expects him back Monday.""Urban has praised him publicly, but feels like in all likelihood, he\'s not going to be here this year."" - @HaysCarlyon pic.twitter.com/uVcC0i4bHt— 1010 XL / 92.5 FM (@1010XL) June 3, 2021      #1 Tennesse Titans The Tennessee Titans recently traded for wide receiver Julio Jones and have a solid offense that includes quarterback Ryan Tannehill. While Tannehill is the obvious starter in Tennessee, the depth behind him doesn\'t have a lot of experience. DeShone Kizer and Logan Woodside are the current backups to Tannehill. If either were to start in place of Tannehill, their offense might not be able to utilize all of their offensive weapons. So trading for Gardner Minshew would allow the Titans to have a solid, reliable backup quarterback, one who has a big arm and could use his legs if the need be.  #2 Carolina Panthers This off-season, the Carolina Panthers traded Teddy Bridgewater with the Denver Broncos and acquired Sam Darnold from the New York Jets. The Panthers believe offensive coordinator Joe Brady would fix any issues Darnold has had so far in his career. Darnold\'s current backup is PJ Walker, who was not only a solid Temple quarterback but also an XFL one with the Houston Roughnecks. Acquiring Gardner Minshew could be good for the Panthers because if Darnold\'s issues don\'t get resolved, the former could end up becoming their starting quarterback.     REPORT: The Jaguars might accept a 5th or 6th round pick for QB Gardner Minshew. pic.twitter.com/wPeLzhdlLA— JPA Football 🏈 (@jpafootball) June 11, 2021   #3 Indianapolis Colts The Colts traded for Carson Wentz. While they probably won\'t be trading for a backup quarterback, too, especially in their own division, it might be a good idea. Wentz has struggled to stay on the field his entire career because of injuries. The Colts\' current backup quarterback options are Jacob Eason and 2021 draft pick Sam Ehlinger. Both are young and without experience, so if Wentz were to have injury issues again, the Colts would be in a tough bind.      #4 Houston Texans Deshaun Watson\'s situation hasn\'t had any updates lately, so it is not known if or when the quarterback would start the 2021 season. The Texans drafted Davis Mills out of Stanford in this year\'s draft. The Texans also signed Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel as backup options. But with the type of offense the Texans run, Gardner Minshew might be better suited than the above options if Watson is no longer one.#5 Washington Football TeamThe Washington Football Team has added a few key pieces to their offense this off-season. Veteran journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick signed with Washington after spending two seasons with the Miami Dolphins. Fitzpatrick won\'t be the starting quarterback in the long term, so Washington will need another option soon. Gardner Minshew could be that one.     ', 'NFL trade rumors: Where would a Gardner Minshew trade leave the Jacksonville Jaguars?  Jacksonville Jaguars QB Gardner Minshew ll took the NFL by storm as an unknown sixth-round selection in 2019. When he took over for the injured Nick Foles in the season opener, he became a fan favorite.  Between his burly physique, his mullet and the handlebar mustache, Minshew became a pop culture icon nearly overnight. In 2019, Minshew\'s had a 6-6 record as a starter and threw 21 TDs and 6 INTs. He earned a starting role in 2020 but battled injuries and a decline in his performance (1-7 record).        DOUBT GARDNER MINSHEW AT YOUR OWN RISK pic.twitter.com/O4DxRfuxCq— PFF (@PFF) September 20, 2020           Head coach Urban Meyer then entered the building and drafted his own QB in #1 overall pick QB Trevor Lawrence. Minshew essentially lost his starting job, forced to settle as a backup. To add salt to the wound, the team signed four-year veteran QB CJ Beathard right before the draft to compete with Gardner Minshew. From QB1 to possible QB3, where does Gardner Minshew go from here? Both Urban Meyer and OC Darell Bevell have nothing but positive things to say about Gardner Minshew during interviews. Bevell said he\'s impressed with the way he carries himself on and off the field.     Meyer says he\'s been working on building a strong relationship with his QB. Most players in this situation would have already demanded a trade. Gardner Minshew, though, isn\'t most players and hasn\'t asked for a trade, though some teams have called with interest. Gardner Minshew trade value and possible destinations After months of speculation about Minshew\'s next turn in the NFL, the Jaguars have finally revealed their asking price and it\'s a draft pick in either the fifth or the sixth round. For someone who has a 6-6 record as a rookie, that could be a bargain. ESPN\'s Jeremy Fowler has reported that Gardner Minshew would like a chance to compete for the QB1 spot wherever he lands. That limits the teams that will continue to barter for his talents. The Carolina Panthers have emerged as contenders, but Sam Darnold seems to be their starter this year. The Dallas Cowboys are another team and would prefer to have Gardner Minshew as Dak Prescott\'s backup if he has an injury setback.     Philadelphia is an intriguing spot with QB Jalen Hurts not quite named the starter yet. Minshew would have a legit shot to be the starter, but it\'s late in the offseason, too. Houston is another team on the list with Deshaun Watson\'s future still murky. Their backup options aren\'t very inspiring either. Minshew has a knack for learning new offenses on the fly with success, playing in four different systems in college and several in the NFL already. The impact of a Gardner Minshew trade on the Jaguars Trevor Lawrence is a generational talent and CJ Beathard has performed well enough in camp to remain in the battle for QB2. From a financial viewpoint, there\'s little impact on the Jaguars. Jacksonville has plenty of cap space to play with and cutting either Minshew ($95K dead money) or Beathard ($2.5 million dead money) is unlikely to make the franchise lose any sleep. The team would only get a Day 3 pick in either trade.     As for experience,Gardner Minshew has been with the team for two years and has a decent relationship with his teammates, both new and old. Minshew seems a bit more talented than Beathard and part of his 2020 decline likely stemmed from his unreported thumb injury. One of the few flaws coaches have pointed out is that he tends to leave the pocket too early. Minshew would be one of the better backups in the league if he were to stay with Jacksonville. If something were to happen to Trevor Lawrence, the coaches would prefer to have a proven player in their system to step up. Gardner Minshew’s mullet is gone, but what a run it had. We’ll always remember its beauty. (Via @youre_like_really_pretty on Instagram) pic.twitter.com/r5oWQkSybj— Field Yates (@FieldYates) June 14, 2021     The best choice for Gardner Minshew would be, to quote Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused, to ""keep on keeping on."" He\'s been keeping his head down and showing up at training so far. He\'ll likely beat out CJ Beathard by the end of camp and will work closely with Lawrence throughout the season. However, Minshew is still destined to leave the team this year. The likely scenarios Philadelphia HC Nick Sirianni isn\'t completely ready to give Jalen Hurts the go-ahead and there\'s a chance Hurts won\'t pan out or suffers an injury. Dak Prescott could also suffer an injury setback, leaving Dallas without a capable QB. Deshaun Watson could be ineligible to play at any time now. Gardner Minshew\'s best path is to continue to grow in Florida and prove the injury was the cause of his decline. At some point in the season, there will likely be a team that is in dire need of his services as a starter.If no team has a QB issue (unlikely) and there\'s no trade offer that suits all parties, Minshew will stay put in Jacksonville until next offseason. Teams can then bring Gardner Minshew in early enough to get a feel for the system and have a fighting shot.     ', ""NFL 2018: Week 3 Major Talking Points  With week 3 over and done with, week 4 rears its head with the Vikings facing the Rams in a big-time matchup on TNF fast approaching. Before that gets underway, I’m going to list my 5 major talking points from the week 3 action.  Jimmy Garoppolo        It seems to be a weekly occurrence that at least one star player goes down with a torn ACL. Unfortunately for 49ers fans it was handsome Jimmy’s turn to suffer the dreaded tear. The 49ers haven’t had much luck this season, with hotly tipped RB Jerick McKinnon suffering the same fate in preseason.           The loss of Garoppolo leaves a much bigger void though. CJ Beathard is next man up for the Niners, which won’t excite many fans around the NFL. Beathard played in 7 games last season, throwing 4 TDs and 6 INTS, with a QB rating of 69.2. The rest of the season looks bleak for the 49ers.  The Minnesota Vikings Buffalo Bills v Minnesota Vikings     What the sweet hell happened to the Vikings this past Sunday. After pulling off an impressive comeback against the Packers in week 2, the Vikings faced the lowly Buffalo Bills. They were projected as 17.5 points favourites before kick off and seemed to have the Bills beaten all over the field…..on paper. The Bills ended up dismantling the Vikings, and in particular Kirk Cousins. Cousins threw 1 INT and lost 2 fumbles in an off day for the whole Vikings team. The Bills dominated from start to finish and eventually ended up winning the game 27-6, much to the chagrin of Cousins and Diggs fantasy owners, me included. Baker Mayfield New York Jets v Cleveland Browns     The Browns have finally snapped the winless streak, much in part to their new QB under center. Baker Mayfield came in to replace a concussed Tyrod Taylor, who was having a nightmare game. The Cleveland faithful were chanting Baker's name, and they got what they asked for.  Mayfield looked composed under center, finishing with 17/23 for 201 yards. The inclusion of Mayfield means the fantasy outlook looks brighter for Jarvis Landry, Antonio Callaway and David Njoku. With the Oakland Raiders up next, the Browns may well go in to the matchup as favourites. Can you Browns make it two wins on the trot?  Alvin Kamara New Orleans Saints v Atlanta Falcons     Alvin Kamara is a super freak. The New Orleans Running Back has started 2018 just like he finished 2017, with impressive performances coming week after week. In week 3, the Saints just nudged out the Falcons in a match that went into overtime.  Kamara finished with stats of 66 yards on the ground from 16 carries, as well as 15 catches for 124 yards. Kamara received 20 targets in week 3 alone. That is insane! It ranks for 5th most in the league, and he is a Running Back! It will be interesting to see his usage going forward, with Mark Ingram returning in week 5. Ingram is likely to take over most of the early down rushing work, but that won’t affect Kamara’s production if he keeps getting 20 targets per game! He is quickly becoming one of the best backs in this league.  The Rams Los Angeles Chargers v Los Angeles Rams     The Rams had an impressive 2017 campaign and then built on it with a strong offseason. They have started 2018 incredibly well, notching up wins against the Raiders, Cardinals and the Chargers. Jared Goff looks like he has taken that next step with his progression. He looked great against the Chargers, completing 29 of 36 passes for 354 and 3 TDs, adding 1 INT in the progress.  Todd Gurley looks immense as always. The receiving trio can hit you from all angles, with Cooks, Kupp and Woods all possessing the ability to have huge games. The Defense is much improved, although it did suffer two injuries to start CBs Marcus Peters and Aqib Talib.  Talib looks like he is headed for surgery, whilst Peters is a shorter-term casualty. The schedule is quite tough over the next few weeks, with visits to Seattle and Denver, as well as hosting the Vikings in week 4. Can they negotiate their way through those matchups and come out of it with a 6-0 record? I wouldn’t be surprised.

Some of his QB stats were brutal relative to the competition, per 98.7 FM Arizona\'s Sports Station: ""Rosen ranked 33rd and last among qualified candidates with a quarterback rating of 66.7 this season. That ranked immediately behind rookie Bills QB Josh Allen’s 67.9 and rookie Jets signal-caller Sam Darnold’s 77.6 rating. Rosen was also 33rd by averaging 163 passing yards per game and just 5.80 yards per attempt.""     The leash in Arizona was so short that he was yanked from the position and was on a different NFL roster by year two. Miami took him on as Ryan Fitzpatrick\'s backup, and he couldn\'t play his way out of that role. No team took him on during the pandemic-stricken 2020 season. He was hardly given a chance with the Atlanta Falcons, though his 2/11 passing performance probably had a lot to do with that. Blake Bortles was at the top of the world in 2018 Blake Bortles It\'s somewhat tragic tracking the trajectory of Blake Bortles\' NFL career, thus far. The Florida-born quarterback played college ball at UCF. He was drafted with the 2014 NFL Draft\'s No. 3 pick to be the franchise signal-caller in Jacksonville. His rookie season was disappointing enough to put him on the chopping block. Somehow, he persevered and threw for 35 touchdowns in what was the antithesis of a sophomore slump.

Marcus Mariota 19.9 Things peaked in January 2018 when Bortles\' Jaguars went toe-to-toe with Tom Brady\'s Patriots, but the New England 24-20 win was the closest Bortles would get to being at the top of the NFL totem pole. His offensive line was shaky. His receivers weren\'t putting themselves in position to make plays, and ultimately Bortles himself no longer had the stuff to be the starter for any team, at least, according to the league. Mark Sanchez had a rough season in 2012, got injured, and never returned to a starting role     Mark Sanchez Mark Sanchez can definitely up the tragedy from Blake Bortles\' case. Sanchez came from USC as a top prospect and immediately had the Jets in the AFC Championship his first and second seasons after years of futility from the franchise, with Chad Pennington as the primary option under center. Then, Tim Tebow was brought into the mix. The ""butt fumble"" transpired at MetLife Stadium on Thanksgiving night 2012 just weeks after Hurricane Sandy. Sanchez was injured playing in a preseason game in the summer of 2013, while trying to earn the starting job. Sanchez\'s prospects of being a top option in someone\'s backfield were gone.        Then-Jets coach Rex Ryan spoke of his regret at even having the former first-round NFL Draft pick in the game late during a preseason game. He said that he would have changed things if he could: “That was a tough situation obviously. If I could go back and change things, of course you would. You don’t want anybody to ever get hurt. But again, you’ve got to decide, guys. Somebody has to play.” When it happened, Ryan was far less remorseful. He suggested that Sanchez being on the field was necessary. This would enable the team to decide who the starting QB would be for the 2013 season between Sanchez and Geno Smith: ""We\'re there to win. We had our starting offense out there for three quarters -- we\'re trying to win the game, that\'s what we wanted to do. … We\'re trying to compete. Everybody\'s out there and injuries are part of the game.""     No matter how Sanchez lost his 2013 season, it was clear he was no longer the guy in New York with second-round rookie Smith out to become QB1. He would never start again in his NFL career. Geno Smith was another Jets flameout Geno Smith Unfortunately, speaking of Geno Smith, he was a fellow Jets flameout in 2014. He joined the man he replaced and was neck and neck with during Gang Green\'s 2013 QB competition, Mark Sanchez. He had identical touchdowns to interceptions, but Smith\'s 2014 season hit an embarrassingly low-point in December of that year with the Jets limiting him to eight pass attempts for the first 58 minutes. When New York needed him to successfully run the two-minute drill, he threw an interception with 34 seconds left to close the door on a 16-13 loss.     Smith is, somehow, in the running for Seattle\'s starting job here in 2022, with the Seahawks competition coming down to the 31-year-old and one of the pieces in the Russell Wilson trade, Drew Lock. By no means is he a clear-cut NFL starter, and he hasn\'t been one in eight years. Colin Kaepernick is no longer be a starter for many reasons Colin Kaepernick This inclusion may be controversial, but Colin Kaepernick did not engineer a winning effort in San Francisco during his final seasons in the Bay in 2015 and 2016.        The 49ers made a business decision that had on-field ramifications during the winter of 2017 in cutting him. Jimmy Garoppolo, future Super Bowl QB, entered the room with long-time utility option C. J. Beathard.The fact that few teams have looked at him since then is probably primarily due to off-field distractions, but Kaepernick was never NFL starter material after showing the inability to hit his targets during a difficult 2016 campaign.     ', ""NFL 2020: Power Rankings Week 5  Week 4 has passed in the NFL 2020 season, and we saw several shocking results but as well as interesting moves made by some teams. A few surprises in terms of the power rankings have occurred, which includes the Philadelphia Eagles getting their first win of the season and the Panthers getting their second win of the season.  With that being said, let's take a look at the Power Rankings coming into Week 5.                   #32 New York Giants New York Giants v Los Angeles Rams It was certainly a slow game to start with against the Los Angeles Rams, and the Giants gave it away in the end. Giants' quarterback Daniel Jones didn't look good for the fourth straight week and the defense was the same. Everyone is talking about quarterback Dwayne Haskins and his inability to play, but it's time to start talking about Jones and his lack of play making.  #31 New York Jets     Denver Broncos v New York Jets New York Jets' quarterback Sam Darnold continues to show why he deserves to be on a better team. The Jets lost several players on Thursday night alone and were without several starters before the game, which doesn't help head coach Adam Gase whose job is under scrutiny. There continues to be question's around the new turf installed at MetLife Stadium, as it has taken out many players now for the season.  #30 Washington Football Team     Baltimore Ravens v Washington Football Team Quarterback Dwayne Haskins looked much better compared to last week's game against the Cleveland Browns. Haskins completed 32/45 passes for 314 yards with 1 rushing touchdown and 0 interceptions. Considering he was playing a stingy Baltimore Ravens' defense, this was an improvement. But he is still on the hot seat and has to continue this kind of performance for the next few games.  #29 Jacksonville Jaguars Jacksonville Jaguars v Cincinnati Bengals     Gardner Minshew and his offense looked just fine in the game against the Cincinnati Bengals, but the Jacksonville Jaguars' defense needs to improve if they want to win any games without relying only on Minshew. The defense allowed Bengals' running back Joe Mixon to have a field day on the Jaguars defensive line, allowing him 151 rushing yards with two touchdowns.  #28 Houston Texans Baltimore Ravens v Houston Texans With the breaking news of head coach Bill O'Brien being fired, this could be the move this organization needed and inspire the Texans to win their first game of the seasons against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 5. Giving a struggling Vikings' team their first win certainly wasn't a right look for the Texans.      #27 Atlanta Falcons Atlanta Falcons v Green Bay Packers Injuries in secondary continue to pile up, which puts the pressure on Matt Ryan and the offense. Receiver Julio Jones was not present during the second half of the game against the Packers on Monday night. But it seems like head coach Dan Quinn isn't on the line to be fired just yet.  #26 Denver Broncos Denver Broncos v New York Jets     Brett Rypien looked good in the beginning, but then threw 3 interceptions against the New York Jets on Thursday night. Rypien will likely be the starter against the New England Patriots in Week 5, but the defense needs to do better as they gave up 22 points to a Jets' offense in which Darnold has thrown to 26 different receivers.  #25 Minnesota Vikings Tennessee Titans v Minnesota Vikings The Vikings finally got their first of the season after an 0-3 start to the season. Kirk Cousins looked better than the past 3 games on Sunday and certainly recognized the Texans' weak secondary that allowed two receivers to have over 100 yards. However, it'll take more than a win against a team that just fired their head coach to show some improvement.     #24 Miami Dolphins Seattle Seahawks v Miami Dolphins Ryan Fitzpatrick didn't look too good against a Seattle Seahawks' defense that has allowed on average 28.6 points to opposing defenses coming into the game against the Dolphins. If he struggles against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 5, we could see rookie Tua Tagovailoa.  #23 Detroit Lions New Orleans Saints v Detroit Lions     The Lions almost had a win against the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. The game certainly puts the Lions on the watch as an underdog team, as long as quarterback Matthew Stafford stays healthy. They should be able to take down the Jaguars easily, considering their defense has been giving up big points to opposing teams.  #22 Philadelphia Eagles Philadelphia Eagles v San Francisco 49ers The Eagles got their first win of the season and jumped to the top of the NFC East with a 1-2-1 record. Carson Wentz still didn't look at his best on the field and the win was mostly due to the lackluster performance by the 49ers and the Eagles' defense showing up for once. It will be asurprise if they are at the top of the division for too long though.      #21 Cincinnati Bengals Jacksonville Jaguars v Cincinnati Bengals Rookie Joe Burrow continues to show why he was worth being the first overall pick in the 2020 draft. A few more pieces including a better offensive line and revamp of the defense could make the Bengals a genuine threat within the next few years. But they have a real test in Week 5, as they will face the Baltimore Ravens.  #20 Los Angeles Chargers Los Angeles Chargers v Tampa Bay Buccaneers     Chargers' head coach Anthony Lynn would be crazy to put Tyrod Taylor in as the starter after what rookie Justin Herbert has shown so far. It was certainly a good game against the Buccaneers, in which the Chargers had the lead through the first half. They play on prime time in Week 5 against the Saints, which should be yet another good game.  #19 Dallas Cowboys Cleveland Browns v Dallas Cowboys In what seemed like another possible comeback by the Cowboys, the team fell short in a game that Dak Prescott threw 502 yards for. The offense is doing just fine, but the defense was a point shy of allowing the Browns to score 50 points on the team. Cowboys' defensive coordinator Mike Nolan could be on the line right now.      #18 Chicago Bears Indianapolis Colts v Chicago Bears After Nick Foles was named the starter, he didn't seem like the savior that the Chicago Bears were looking for against the Colts. He threw just 1 touchdown and one pick for a loss on Sunday. Foles will have to do much more if they want to compete against the Buccaneers in Week 5.  #17 San Francisco 49ers Philadelphia Eagles v San Francisco 49ers     Several costly mistakes by Niners' Nick Mullens gave the win to the Eagles. He was replaced by C.J. Beathard late in the fourth quarter as they tried for a comeback. Jimmy Garappolo is expected back in Week 5 but if he isn't, it would be interesting to see who head coach Kyle Shanahan picks as their starter. #16 Arizona Cardinals Detroit Lions v Arizona Cardinals The Cardinals started out 2-0 and since then have lost 2 straight games. Don't count them out just yet though, as the duo of Kyler Murray and DeAndre Hopkins has proven to be lethal. Hopefully it is nothing but a small road bump for the team, as they should be able to bounce back easily when they face the New York Jets in Week 5.      #15 Carolina Panthers Carolina Panthers v Los Angeles Chargers Are the Panthers a sleeper team? They have now won 2 straight games and with the Falcons on the horizon for Week 5, it could be their 3rd win of the season. They sit 2-2 tied with the Saints who are struggling as well, so 2nd place is certainly up for grabs in the NFC South.  #14 New Orleans Saints New Orleans Saints v Detroit Lions     The Saints were lucky to win the game against the Lions, otherwise we would all be wondering as to what is going on with this Saints team that should have been 4-0 currently. The defense has to improve and should look back to Week 1, in which they took down Tom Brady and his offense in a clinical manner.  #13 Las Vegas Raiders Buffalo Bills v Las Vegas Raiders The Raiders put up a fight against the red-hot Buffalo Bills but couldn't close it out. But it's safe to say that the Raiders are the real deal and the only team standing in their way is the Kansas City Chiefs, who are on the top of their division.      #12 Cleveland Browns Cleveland Browns v Dallas Cowboys The Cleveland Browns offense (and emphasis on offense) is the real deal and it was finally showcased against the Cowboys on Sunday, as they were just 1 point away from scoring 50 points. Baker Mayfield threw 2 touchdowns, while the running game was a big contributor to the success. If only the defense could make improvements, they might just make it to the playoffs this season.  #11 Indianapolis Colts Indianapolis Colts v Chicago Bears     There's nothing much to say about the Colts. Philip Rivers played just fine and the Colts' defense did enough to stop Nick Foles and the Bears from winning. They are sitting at 3-1 and face the Browns, so the defense should get a real test after The Browns scored 49 points against the Cowboys.  #10 Los Angeles Rams New York Giants v Los Angeles Rams The Rams struggled for some reason against the 0-3 New York Giants, but ultimately got the win. The defense didn't allow a single touchdown by the Giants and forced only 3 field goals. The Rams face the 1-3 Washington Football Team, a team which head coach Sean McVay is very familiar with.      #9 Pittsburgh Steelers Pittsburgh Steelers v New York Giants The Steelers were unable to play in Week 4 due several players on the Tennessee Titans testing positive for the COVID-19 virus. Initially the plan was to play on Monday or Tuesday night, but more Titans' players were tested positive and as a result, the game was pushed to Week 7. #8 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Los Angeles Chargers v Tampa Bay Buccaneers     It was an ugly start for the Buccaneers against the Chargers in the first half. But something got Brady and the offense on fire, as he threw 5 touchdown passes in a 38-31 win against the Chargers. Despite losing his two receivers in the game and not having help after that, the ageless quarterback showed us why he's still a threat in the league.  #7 New England Patriots New England Patriots v Kansas City Chiefs The Patriots need Cam Newton back soon, as Brian Hoyer was not able to take on the Chiefs. He was benched for Jarrett Stidham who tried to get them on the board just once more, but it wasn't enough. It's unclear whether Newton can play next week against the Broncos, but I would suspect a change in starters if he is deemed to still not be in the clear of the COVID-19 virus.      #6 Tennessee Titans Tennessee Titans v Minnesota Vikings The Titans had several players test positive for the COVID-19 virus, which postponed their Week 4 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the past few days since, there have not been any new positive cases within the team, which is a good sign moving forward.  #5 Buffalo Bills Buffalo Bills v Las Vegas Raiders     I said it last week and I'll say it again; Josh Allen is legit. With the Patriots without their star quarterback, the Bills could be the first place winners of the AFC East and dethrone the Patriots. They do play the Titans in Week 5, which will be a real test for this defense that still needs some improving but showed signs of much better play compared to Week 3.  #4 Seattle Seahawks Dallas Cowboys v Seattle Seahawks The Seahawks continue to get lucky, as the Dolphins certainly choked their way into a loss during the fourth quarter of the game. Had it not been for the Seahawks' defense, it could have been a Dolphins win. The Seahawks will only get tested in Week 6, when they play their division rival, Cardinals.      #3 Baltimore Ravens Baltimore Ravens v Washington Football Team This was an easy win for the Ravens. Tight end Mark Andrews had 2 touchdowns himself, which helped them overcome a Washington team that has allowed multiple teams to score 30+ points. They will be visited by Joe Burrow and the Bengals in a division rival stand-off for Week 5.  #2 Green Bay Packers Green Bay Packers v New Orleans Saints     The Packers took down the Falcons easily, as the offense looked good both in the passing and running game. Rodgers was without two of his top receivers tonight as well but despite that, he helped get the win for the team. If the defense can fix the penalty situation, it could help prevent possible comebacks by opposing teams.  #1 Kansas City Chiefs New England Patriots v Kansas City Chiefs The Chiefs are unstoppable, both on the offense and defense on the side of the ball. For now, it certainly seems like they will be the repeat Superbowl winners if they continue to play like this. They face the Raiders in Week 5.

58,Sam Bradford,"['Who Will be the Vikings Quarterback?  We all know what\'s happening in Minnesota: a quarterback situation.  Three quarterbacks heading into free agency and what can we expect from the Minnesota Vikings front office to do about it? Here\'s a backstory:        Quarterback (QB) Teddy Bridgewater was the franchise QB the team needed and was performing well. In 2016, he severely injured his left leg and did not play until the Week 15 of 2017 season. As a result of his injury, the Vikings traded for QB Sam Bradford from the Philadelphia Eagles in 2016. He performed well until an injury to his knee in 2017 and played just one game that season. This time, QB Case Keenum was brought in.  Keenum\'s performance left my jaw dropping, and certainly many others too. He did not look like the same player under Jeff Fisher\'s system with the Los Angeles Rams. But now that all three quarterbacks are free agents, what should the Vikings do? This is my take on what the front office should do: - It\'s obvious that QB needy teams will pursue Keenum, and after his performance, I believe the Vikings should give him another one or two year ""prove it"" deal that will solidify whether or not Keenum is the answer for the foreseeable future. However, the Vikings can also place the franchise tag on Keenum, which would give him around $23 million     - \u200eBridgewater is still a young guy who is capable of starting somewhere. But on what team? If the Vikings bring back Keenum, I believe they will bring Bridgewater back as well - \u200eEven though the Vikings gave the Eagles a 1st round pick for Bradford, I don\'t think it\'s worth keeping him simply because of his issues with staying healthy. Bradford will not be pursued by the Vikings and will hit the QB market. He will likely end up on a team in need of a backupAgain, this is what I think the front office should do, currently it is unclear what will happen.

These players almost always get selected toward the top of the NFL Draft the year they come out of college because of the importance that quarterbacks have on the future of a franchise.  While, sometimes, these hyped-up quarterbacks go on to become NFL legends, it doesn\'t always work out that way. The ""can\'t miss"" title doesn\'t always live up to its name as some of the prospects labeled with it go on to fail. Here are five quarterbacks who never lived up to their extremely high expectations.        Hyped NFL QBs who failed to meet expectations           #1 - Ryan Leaf San Diego Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf Ryan Leaf is one of the most infamous players in NFL history to be labeled a bust because of how highly he was rated as a prospect. He shared a draft class with the legendary Peyton Manning, and many scouts believed Leaf was the better quarterback. When the Indianapolis Colts selected Manning, instead of Leaf, with the first overall pick, most thought it was the wrong choice.

Peyton Manning is one of the greatest of all time, winning five NFL MVP awards and two Super Bowl rings, while Leaf lasted just 18 games. He has a 4-14 record with 36 interceptions. #2 - Akili Smith Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Akili Smith     Akili Smith was considered an extremely special talent when coming out of college. His elite athelticism and style of play was supposed to usher in the next generation of quarterbacks.

UO vs. UW 1997Look at the footwork. 👀 https://t.co/juIbCL8Ot8 While mobility became a desired trait for teams in search of a quarterback, Akili Smith never worked out the way the Cincinnati Bengals had hoped when they drafted him third overall. He has won just three of his 18 starts while throwing just five touchdowns and 13 interceptions.     NFL QBs who never lived up to their high expectations #3 - Cade McNown Chicago Bears quarterback Cade McNown The Chicago Bears have notoriously struggled to find a legitimate franchise quarterback throughout the majority of their long history. The Bears are one of the most legendary teams in NFL history for many reasons, but quarterbacks haven\'t been one of them.         The Bears thought they had found themselves an elite prospect when they drafted Cade McNown. He had all of the tools that teams looked for in a franchise quarterback, but for whatever reason he never blossomed. He lasted just two years with the Bears and posted a 3-12 record before being cut. He never started another game in his career. #4 - Joey Harrington Detroit Lions quarterback Joey Harrington Joey Harrington was a highly-rated quarterback prospect when the Detroit Lions selected him with with their third-overall draft pick. He was mainly their starting quarterback for four consecutive seasons, but failed to show any consistency. He posted a 18-37 record with 60 touchdowns and 62 interceptions.

He started 21 games split between the Miami Dolphins and Atlanta Falcons, recording a 8-13 record with 19 touchdowns and 23 interceptions. Despite many chances, he never lived up to his potential. #5 - Sam Bradford St. Louis Rams quarterback Sam Bradford     Sam Bradford was selected as the first overall pick in the NFL Draft by the St. Louis Rams after winning the Heisman Trophy for his outstanding performance in college football. While his overall career as a quarterback wasn\'t as bad as some of the other names on this list, he failed to meet the huge expectations of being the number one overall pick.     Most labeled Bradford a ""can\'t miss"" prospect coming out of college and almost everyone expected him to find great success. He jumped around and started with four different teams during his career. His overall production was uninspiring. He finished with a 34-48-1 record across eight mediocre seasons while failing to ever reach his true potential, despite receiving every opportunity to do so.

While a few teams are set with the best of the best in Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, and Russell Wilson, others have a promising future with Carson Wentz, Watson, and Jared Goff.  However, there are a few that have the full package apart from the signal caller spot. This year has some big-name quarterbacks hitting the open market such as AJ McCarron, Kirk Cousins, Sam Bradford, and Case Keenum.        Adding to that some great talent in this year's draft and most of these teams will be searching for options ahead of the upcoming season. Here are five teams who need to sort out their quarterback situation: #5 Buffalo Bills The Bills have two quarterbacks under contract for next season, Tyrod Taylor and Nathan Peterman. Taylor is most likely on his way out with Buffalo looking to lower the money he is making, or trade him. Nathan could develop, but he was awful when he got his opportunity this past season. Taylor's situation has been strange in Buffalo for a while. He has always played well for them, but it seems as if they never really wanted him to be their guy. Even if Nathan was thought to be the solution prior to his terrible performances, Buffalo couldn't possibly feel comfortable with him as of today. Buffalo have two first-round picks in this year's draft. It is possible they select a quarterback in their position or even use the picks to move up and draft one of the best available. No matter what, they are in a tight situation.     #4 Cleveland Browns Ghosts of Browns past The Browns have been the cream of the crap in the NFL for decades now. They attempted the Brock project last season and that flopped hard. Kizer was not great in his first year, but he could develop if given the proper attention and time. He is the sole reason the Browns don't place higher on this list. The Browns can't give up on Kizer after only one season, but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't beef up their quarterback room a bit.     If Cousins is chasing after the most money or a hero's treatment, Cleveland may be the spot for him. No matter who it is, they have to add some veteran leadership. They had three very young quarterbacks on the roster once Brock was cut. Kizer isn't starter-ready as of this moment and even his college head coach acknowledged that fact before the draft. The Browns need a guy who is capable of starting now and that guy isn't on the roster. #3 Denver Broncos Is Lynch a bust?     The Broncos are in quarterback purgatory. Trevor isn't the answer, Brock certainly isn't the answer, and Lynch does not seem to be either. Elway has struck out on quarterbacks and his history makes his choices in the draft untrustworthy. Denver needs to pray free agent quarterbacks are interested in going to Mile High. The defense is ageing, but it is still a top 10 in the league. That might be enough to attract Case, Kirk, Bradford, or someone else. A veteran who is average at best could help to elevate this team back to the playoffs. Denver do not have much of an open window left. They are even shopping some of their talent to make some space. Elway wants this team to raise more banners and for that to happen they need a huge quarterback overhaul. #2 New York Jets Jets need a franchise QB     The New York media can chew these guys up and spit them out. The latest examples are guys like Smith. He was never ready for his spotlight. Right now, there is no guy on the roster capable of leading this team to the promise land. The Jets need a locker room leader who can make big plays for them. They can definitely find a guy who fits the bill in this year's draft. No matter how they get it done the Jets need to start the search for a franchise quarterback. They certainly don't have one on their roster. Hopefully, whoever it is doesn't get booed by his own fans immediately. #1 Arizona Cardinals Palmer retires... Now what?     Do the Cardinals even have a mediocre quarterback on the roster? Carson Palmer is officially retired and that leaves Arizona in a bad place. There was no one on the roster who could step up as a true number one quarterback. Last year, Arizona made a huge mistake not drafting a quarterback. They need to draft one this year. They do not have the best spot in the draft either. That will make it even more difficult to find a replacement for Palmer. No team in the NFL has as little talent on the roster at the position or options in the off-season. Which is why they are in the worst quarterback situation in the NFL.

EJ Manuel making his first NFL start didn’t dominate the game, but showed flashes of a great quarterback. The big surprise of this game was how the Bills defense was able to cause turnovers and frustrate the Patriot offense. In the end, Tom Brady is still the best QB in the two minute drill.           Ravens 27 Broncos 49 Peyton Manning threw seven touchdown passes and embarrassed the world champs on opening night. Much was made in the off-season about the losses in the Ravens defense, and it definitely showed on Thursday as everyone looked lost and confused out there. The mix of Peyton’s greatness and a team without an identity (without Ray Lewis) combined to make this one of the best passing performances of modern times. Vikings 24 Lions 34 Reggie Bush made an immediate impact in the Lion’s offense. Last season, Detroit struggled to get any production from the RB position and Bush quickly changed that as he not only ran the ball well, but was able to score on a 77 yard screen pass that changed the game. For the Vikings, Adrian Peterson looked solid, but no other part of the offense did.     Chiefs 28 Jaguars 2 This was the most dominating performance of the week. The Chiefs defense made Gabbert look like a Pop-Warner quarterback as Andy Reid got his first win with the Chiefs. Buccaneers 17 Jets 18 Geno Smith led the last minute drive as he got a win in his first start. The game changing play was when Smith was hit late out of bounds by a Bucs linebacker that put the Jets in position to kick the game winning field goal. This was the story of the game as Tampa Bay committed 13 penalties and were very sloppy. Packers 28 49ers 34 San Fran still looks like the team to beat, although a questionable ruling helped them win the game. Colin Kaepernick showed that he could not only run the read option, but could also sit in the pocket and throw the ball as he carved up the Packers for over 400 yards passing. Giants 31 Cowboys 36 Sad to say, but the GMEN have never been sloppier, but we fans should remain optimistic. A Tom Coughlin coached team will never again give six turnovers. You had to feel that Eli was going to lead them down the field for the win until Scott was slow to turn for the screen. But even though that was a huge mistake, it was correctable. Scott is a very tough runner who is going to help the GMEN down the road as is Wilson, who has to stop fumbling! The defense hung in there and had a good night and they certainly played well enough to win. Terrell Thomas looked great and should be an inspiration to us all. I am more excited now than ever about the Giants. We have never had three receivers who are as dynamic. Anytime we lose to the Cowboys it’s tough, but the GMEN are poised to go on a tear.     Dolphins 23 Browns 10 The Dolphins suffocated the Browns offense and their leads to win. In a very poor offensive game both ways, neither team were able to establish a running game nor able to move the ball much. It was an impressive performance by Brian Hartline who had over 100 yards receiving and a TD catch. For the Browns, the only bright spot on offense was tight end Jordan Cameron who was able to haul in a TD catch.  Wide receiver Vincent Brown #86 of the San Diego Chargers dives and touches the pylon for a 10-yard touchdown in the second quarter against the Houston Texans at Qualcomm Stadium     Bengals 21 Bears 24 The Bears defense doesn’t miss a beat with Urlacher. The recently retired middle linebacker was said to leave a big hole in the Bears defense. However, Sunday proved that this Bears defense will continue to cause turnovers and stuff the run. For the Bengals, AJ Green had over 200 yards receiving and two TDs in the loss. Raiders 17 Colts 21 Terrell Pryor impressed in his first start but showed in the end that he is still a rookie. Pryor had signs of a QB that could keep plays alive and make plays down the field. However, on a first and goal from the Colts 8 yard line, Pryor ate a sack that cost his team field position and a chance to win the game. For the Colts, Andrew Luck came out firing in the first half, struggled much of the second half, but was able to put together the game winning drive.     Falcons 17 Saints 23 The upset of the day as Sean Payton returned to the sidelines to guide the Saints to a win. The Falcons, who figured to be the favorites in the NFC, struggled all day protecting Matt Ryan as the supposed fire-powered offense was only able to muster up 17 points. For the Saints, defensive coordinator Rob Ryan had an impressive debut, often confusing and frustrating the Falcons O-line with his blitz packages. Titans 16 Steelers 9 Two defenses battled as the Titans were able to down the Steelers. The Steelers offense was unable to do anything due to the offensive line getting dominated throughout the whole game. For the Titans, the offense wasn’t very impressive, but did get a TD and a trio of field goals.  Cardinals 24 Rams 27 The St. Louis Rams kicked a last second field goal for the win. Sam Bradford had a very impressive performance that included driving down the Rams to set up the last second field goal. Cardinals’ Carson Palmer looked impressive on his debut as he was able to hit Larry Fitzgerald on a very nice TD throw. The Cardinals also got a good contribution from new RB Rashard Mendenhall.     Eagles 33 Redskins 27 Chip Kelly’s offense had Philly flying, taking the spotlight off RG3 for a second. And I’m very curious to see how NFL defensive coordinators will adjust to Vick and the Eagles. The Eagles defense was extremely impressive, forcing a lot of three and outs and turnovers. Going back to RG3, he definitely had a rough first half with limited mobility, but still had a great second half and it seems both teams do not lack weapons going forward. Texans 31 Chargers 28 The Texans had a second half comeback to stun the Chargers in San Diego. The game, that seemed to be going the Chargers’ way after they picked off Matt Schaub two plays into the game, got away from them at the end. Schaub was able to lead three touchdown drives in the second half and then Houston was able to win on a last second field goal. Phil Rivers, the Chargers QB, had a very good start to the game and ended up throwing three touchdown passes but threw a costly pick at the end.

Let's have a look at which quarterbacks could be playing for which teams in the 2018 NFL season given the uncertainty surrounding many teams at this particular position.        This article will discuss quarterback predictions for each of the NFL's 32 teams in the 2018 season. There are four teams discussed on each slide, with slide grouping being based on the NFL's eight divisions.           Poinsettia Bowl - BYU v Wyoming AFC East New England Patriots - Tom Brady Tom Brady plans to be back for another season to chase his sixth career Super Bowl title, and there is no reason to believe he won't be. Buffalo Bills - Sam Bradford Tyrod Taylor's time as the quarterback of the Bills may be done, and Nathan Peterman has been awful as his backup. With Sam Bradford being the Vikings quarterback most likely to leave the team, he is the best option for Buffalo.     Miami Dolphins - Ryan Tannehill Ryan Tannehill missed the 2017 season due to a torn ACL. If he is healthy, he is who the Dolphins will go with. His statistics have never been great, but they haven't been awful, either. New York Jets - Josh Allen The Jets desperately need a new quarterback. By the time they pick sixth overall in the NFL draft, Josh Rosen will likely be off the board, but Josh Allen will likely still be there. The Jets will not pass him up. Big 12 Championship - Oklahoma v TCU     AFC North Pittsburgh Steelers - Ben Roethlisberger Last year, Ben Roethlisberger said he might not return. Now, he wants to play for at least three more seasons. Count him in for 2018, at least. Baltimore Ravens - Joe Flacco With Joe Flacco, you know what you're getting. If the Ravens can start getting him better weapons, they'd get even more out of him. Cincinnati Bengals - Andy Dalton Andy Dalton has had his struggles, but the Bengals appear to be committed to him. There are plenty of worse options available, so it's not worth the gamble to replace him. Cleveland Browns - Baker Mayfield Of the top-tier quarterbacks in this year's NFL draft, Baker Mayfield is by far the most proven, and his success in college shows that he is ready for the pros. The Browns can select him with the fourth overall pick. Tennessee Titans v Houston Texan     AFC South Jacksonville Jaguars - Blake Bortles I have no clue why everyone wants to replace Blake Bortles so badly. He has never had terrible statistics, not even in 2017 when he played with an injured wrist. Tennessee Titans - Marcus Mariota Marcus Mariota's 2017 season was nothing short of awful, but he should experience a bounce-back year in 2018 under new head coach Mike Vrabel. Indianapolis Colts - Andrew Luck If healthy, Andrew Luck will lead the Colts offense once again. Sitting out the entire 2017 season may help him to prepare for a successful return in 2018. Houston Texans - Deshaun Watson Deshaun Watson's statistics in his six starts in his rookie season this past year were astonishing. When he makes a full recovery from his ACL tear, the league will be put on notice. Washington Redskins v Philadelphia Eagles     AFC West Kansas City Chiefs - Patrick Mahomes With Alex Smith traded to the Redskins, the time for Patrick Mahomes to take over the offense of the Chiefs has come. Los Angeles Chargers - Philip Rivers Philip Rivers will stick around for at least another season for a Chargers team that ended 2017 with nine wins in 12 games thanks to an efficient offense and one of the best defenses in the NFL. Oakland Raiders - Derek Carr Derek Carr's injury history doesn't favor him given his performance late in the 2017 season, but there's no reason to believe he can't lead the Raiders deep into the playoffs if healthy. Denver Broncos - Kirk Cousins Kirk Cousins had arguably his best game of the 2017 season for the Redskins in their win over the Broncos and their top-tier defense. Consider that game a successful audition. Oakland Raiders v Kansas City Chiefs     NFC East Philadelphia Eagles - Carson Wentz Nick Foles led the Eagles to their first Super Bowl victory, but Carson Wentz put him in a position to do so. There is no doubt that he will be their man moving forward. Dallas Cowboys - Dak Prescott Dak Prescott took a step back in 2017 following an MVP-caliber rookie season in 2016. He was still and likely will continue to be a solid quarterback. Washington Redskins - Alex Smith The Redskins paid Alex Smith the money they didn't want to pay Kirk Cousins, so they'll be relying on him to get the team back on track. New York Giants - Eli Manning The Giants want to have Eli Manning back, and there is really no reason for him to leave. He clearly wasn't the problem in their disastrous 2017 season. Minnesota Vikings v Atlanta FalconsNFC North     Minnesota Vikings - Case Keenum After his MVP-caliber 2017 season, there is no way the Vikings can part ways with Case Keenum even if they keep Teddy Bridgewater, which is also a great possibility. Green Bay Packers - Aaron Rodgers No, the Packers do not have to release Aaron Rodgers due to an IR violation. Now that that's clear, the reason he's set to return as the team's starting quarterback again is even more obvious. Detroit Lions - Matthew Stafford The Lions have offseason issues that they need to address if they want to return to the playoffs. Matthew Stafford is not one of them. Chicago Bears - Mitchell Trubisky Mitchell Trubisky showed flashes of potential in his rookie season in 2017. He certainly didn't give the Bears any reason to give up on him yet. Atlanta Falcons v New Orleans Saints     NFC South New Orleans Saints - Drew Brees Drew Brees wants to come back to the Saints, and they want him back. Following several years of disappointment for the team as a whole, Brees proved in 2017 that he still has what it takes to win a Super Bowl. Carolina Panthers - Cam Newton Cam Newton has taken a step back since his MVP season in 2015, but he is still one of the NFL's top quarterbacks. Even in the extremely unlikely scenario in which Diddy buys the team and signs Colin Kaepernick, Newton will still be starting. Atlanta Falcons - Matt Ryan In 2017, Matt Ryan took a step back from his MVP season in 2016, but we know what he is capable of. He still had a solid 2017 season and should be back for more in 2018. Tampa Bay Buccaneers - Jameis Winston Jameis Winston needs to step up if he wants to remain the starting quarterback for the Buccaneers in the long haul. They certainly shouldn't pull the plug yet, though.     Jacksonville Jaguars v San Francisco 49ers NFC West Los Angeles Rams - Jared Goff Jared Goff's first season under Sean McVay was amazing, especially after his disatrous rookie season. The sky is his limit. Seattle Seahawks - Russell Wilson Russell Wilson literally was the entire offense for the Seahawks in the 2017 season, and the team still almost made the playoffs. The 2018 season should produce similar results. Arizona Cardinals - Nick Foles The Eagles could keep Nick Foles, but the likelihood of that is slim. He played college football at Arizona, so this move would make sense. The Cardinals went 8-8 without quarterback Carson Palmer and running back David Johnson for much of the 2017 season, so he could turn them into an immediate contender.     San Francisco 49ers - Jimmy Garoppolo Jimmy Garoppolo's career NFL record is 7-0. Of those seven wins, five came at the end of the season when he took over the reins for a 49ers team that was just 1-10. He is set to prove that he is worth every penny of his new 5-year, $137.5 million contract.

While the likes of Derrick Henry (2015), Lamar Jackson (2016), and Joe Burrow (2019) have become legitimate stars, others have not been as blessed. The first 21st-century winner to fail to live up to the promise of the award was Eric Crouch in 2001, who barely played in the NFL before bouncing around teams. Another example is Jason White (2003), who went undrafted in 2005 and decided to focus on business. But the Heisman did not become retroactively notorious until Tim Tebow (2007). Tebow was already known for his outspokenness on his beliefs, which many believe eventually overshadowed his on-field play. The following year\'s winner Sam Bradford, is better known for earning large amounts of money for subpar play.     Mark Ingram II (2009) helped to restore its credibility by putting up a respectable Pro Bowl career, while Cam Newton (2010) became a legitimate superstar. But the next two winners after them seemingly reasserted the Heisman as an ""overrated"" award. Robert Griffin III (2011) had a wonderful rookie season, but injuries derailed his career. But Johnny Manziel, who made award history the following year as its first freshman recipient, severely tarnished its reputation by becoming a massive draft bust who was more famous for wild partying and run-ins with the law than for on-field performance.Jameis Winston (2013) and Marcus Mariota (2014) have had better careers since receiving their award, but it would not arguably shed the ""overrated"" stigma until Henry.     ', '3 reasons why the Indianapolis Colts need to be careful with Carson Wentz after foot surgery  The Indianapolis Colts reported that quarterback Carson Wentz needed surgery to repair his injured foot eight short days ago. On Tuesday, Wentz made his way to the Colts practice. As shocking as it sounds, Wentz came up walking without a limp and no protection on the surgically repaired foot.  Carson Wentz out here at Colts camp. No boot on foot. No limp I can detect. pic.twitter.com/Hfj6qNsvsQ— Gregg Doyel (@GreggDoyelStar) August 10, 2021        That\'s excellent news for the Colts, but let\'s not count our chickens before they hatch when it comes to Wentz\'s foot injury. Indianapolis needs to take caution with the former Eagles quarterback. Wentz has dealt with injuries throughout his career, and some could compare him to Sam Bradford.           As the NFL preseason begins Thursday, the Indianapolis Colts should rest Wentz as long as possible. With that being said, let\'s look at three reasons why the Colts should take their time with Carson Wentz.  Should the Indianapolis Colts rest Carson Wentz the full 12 weeks? Indianapolis Colts QB Carson Wentz     Carson Wentz\'s foot injury is projected to sideline him for 5-12 weeks. That number is now 4-11 weeks, but would it be wise to rest Wentz the full 12 weeks even if he\'s feeling 100%? Let\'s take a look.  #1 Carson Wentz is the future for the Colts, not the present The Indianapolis Colts are not looking for a short-term fix when it comes to Carson Wentz. Jacob Eason and Sam Ehlinger are great quarterbacks, but neither is ready to lead an NFL franchise. Eason and Ehlinger will share the quarterback responsibilities throughout the preseason. Colts closed out today’s practice with rookie sixth-round pick Sam Ehlinger working as Indy’s starting QB. Today was the first day of camp in which Ehlinger took some reps with the Colts’ starters.— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) August 10, 2021     When Wentz showed up without a limp and walking boot on Tuesday, Colts head coach Frank Reich called it ""very encouraging."" If Wentz stays out the full 12 weeks, he will return in Week 8, but depending on Eason and Ehlinger\'s preseason performances, the Colts could rush him back by Week 1. Rushing Wentz isn\'t the best option for the Colts. Sitting him the full 12 weeks isn\'t the best either. The only way Carson Wentz sits the full 12 weeks is if Eason or Ehlinger are clicking. Indianapolis should hold Wentz out until at least Week 5.  #2 Indianapolis Colts are not under a microscope to win a Super Bowl in 2021 Indianapolis still has kinks to work out before labeling themselves as Super Bowl contenders. Carson Wentz being 100% healthy does give them a shot at making a run in the playoffs, but not a run at the Lombardi trophy. The Colts are missing a few pieces on the offensive side of the football. Indianapolis needs a star-wide receiver. If the Saints make Michael Thomas available, Indianapolis could make a run at the All-Pro wideout.     Adding Michael Thomas improves the Colts\' chances of reaching the AFC Championship game but still doesn\'t get them to the Super Bowl. That\'s why no matter what happens in Indianapolis in 2021, the Colts need to be careful with Wentz.  #3 Carson Wentz is injury prone, and the Colts can\'t afford to lose him long-term Carson\'s injury troubles started in 2016 with the Philadelphia Eagles. Here\'s a quick timeline of Carson Wentz\'s injuries: August 11, 2016: A hairline fracture in his ribsDecember 10, 2017: Grade three ACL tear, Grade three LCL tearOctober 11, 2018: Fracture Vertebral in his backJanuary 5, 2020: Grade one concussionJuly 29, 2021: Pedal Foot Outside of the 2019 season, Carson Wentz has suffered one injury each season. The worst injury came when he tore his ACL, but any damage takes a lot out of an NFL athlete.Sports Injury Predictor has given Carson Wentz an 86% chance of being injured in 2021. He\'s also projected to miss at least two games this season. These may only be projections and chances, but it\'s something the Indianapolis Colts can\'t afford.     ', ""NFL 2018: Ranking the new QB situations for 2018 season  The 2018 off-season began even before the Super Bowl 52 was played. The Washington Redskins agreed to trade for quarterback Alex Smith from the Kansas City Chiefs in late January thus resetting the QB market even before the season ended. Two teams already had two new quarterbacks before the Eagles could beat out the defending champions in February.  The trade freed the embattled ex-Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins to sign with the Minnesota Vikings in Free agency. The Vikings, who made it to the NFC Championship game, had three starting-caliber quarterbacks and let them all hit the free agency and signed Cousins to a first-ever full guaranteed contract.        Weeks prior to the start of free agency it was obvious that the Cousins-Vikings marriage is inevitable, which prompted the MVP of Vikings season Case Keenum to struck a deal with Denver Broncos even before the Cousins deal was finalized. This Keenum deal started the domino effect with many teams that are in the QB market started making deals.           Cleveland Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor from the Buffalo Bills, one of many trades they made this offseason. Arizona Cardinals signed Sam Bradford, New York Jets Signed Teddy Bridgewater and then traded him to the New Orleans Saints after an amazing preseason. AJ McCarron signed with the Bills and got beat out by rookie Josh Allen to become the starter which prompted the Bills to trade him to Oakland. Speaking of rookies, the 2018 draft had as many as Five QBs taken in round 1. By Week 4, four of the 5 are starting and the fifth QB is already seeing some game action in trick plays.     Including both the Veterans and Rookies, there are as many as Eight teams who had new Quarterbacks starting for them this year. Let's take a look at how these QBs fared so far with their new teams. Let's start with a Bonus player, the man who took the league by surprise and then crash landed in week 4:  BONUS: Ryan Fitzpatrick (2-2)  Oh, where to start. When I first started to think about this article after week 2, I had him competing for the number 1 spot with the current number 1 and then week 4 happened and the head coach Dirk Koetter has announced that Jameis Winston will be starting after the week 5 bye.     Since, FitzMagic is just a placeholder for Winston, who was serving his 3-game suspension, I decided not to include him in the rankings but thought he deserved a shout-out for his performance through the first three weeks. He went 2-2 in his starts when no one expected him to be anything better than 1-3. He faced three playoff teams from last year and went 2-1 in those games and came close to being 3-0 while trying to make an epic comeback against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 3. He posted 400 yards in each of his first three games, an NFL record. But week 4 proved why Fitzpatrick is who he is, a journeyman quarterback. The four-game stretch should help him get more money in the next offseason and will be a highly paid backup QB. #8 Josh Rosen/Sam Bradford, Arizona Cardinals (0-4)      Two teams have already started two quarterbacks who were not on their roster last season, one of them is Arizona Cardinals. Cardinals, who saw both their quarterback and head coach retire after last season had a complete overhaul in coaching and QB room. The added three quarterbacks including Mike Glennon. Sam Bradford, who is coming off injuries, signed a 1 year 20 million dollar contract and became a presumed starter. But, the Cardinals are off to a terrible start losing out in all the three starts prompting the change to go with the rookie Josh Rosen. Bradford in his three starts completed 62.5% of his passes for 400 yards and two touchdowns. But, he also had four INTs to his name. Bradford, couldn't move the ball well under Mike McCoy's game plan. He struggled in the first 2 games where the offense only scored 6 points in total. He started off well in the Week 3 matchup against the Chicago Bears where he tossed two TDs to start the game, but then couldn't find the momentum in the rest of the game which paved the way for the rookies Josh Rosen to come in the fourth quarter and try to win the game which was a very close contest.         Rosen was named starter for week 4 and quietly had an impressive debut. Rosen probably threw for only 180 yards but kept the Cardinals in the game without making any stupid mistakes. Cardinals eventually lost to the Russell Wilson's Seahawks, but had a glimpse of their bright future. The Cardinals running game needs to be picked up. The O-line has been one of the worst in the league, which handcuffed one of the elite tailbacks in David Johnson.     This Cardinals offense reminds me of 2016 Rams team which made Todd Gurley, Jared Goff and Case Keenum do nothing. This Cardinals offense is doing the same to David Johnson, Josh Rosen and Larry Fitzerald. Look for a coaching change to come this off season even though it is the first season as a head coach for Steve Wilks, at the very least the OC needs to be changed. With the correct play caller, this offense is capable of some high flying action ala Chiefs, Rams and the Texans. #7 Josh Allen/Nathan Peterman, Buffalo Bills (1-3)      Buffalo Bills had one of the strangest QB competition in NFL this offseason. They had three quarterbacks in the battle for the starting spot during the training camp. All thought that it would be AJ McCarron but instead as the preseason approached McCarron became third stringer and expendable, thus his trade to Raiders. The Bill surprisingly announced Nathan Peterman over the rookie Josh Allen as the starter for week 1, but Peterman repeated his first start performance from last year when he threw for 5 picks. He threw 2 picks and scored nothing, which led for the rookie Josh Allen to take the reigns. Allen in his three starts the next three weeks, completed only 53.4% of passes throwing just two touchdowns with four picks. His best game came in week 3 when the Buffalo Bills stunned the world by beating the Minnesota Vikings. Allen had three total TDs, 2 of them coming on the ground, showing off his athleticism in that game. But, he came back to earth in week 4, throwing 2 picks against an average Packers defense.     Allen, as expected, is raw and playing like a typical rookie. In an ideal scenario, he could use a redshirt season before taking over the reigns like Patrick Mahomes, but he did not have the luxury of learning under someone like Alex Smith, instead, the situation has thrust him into starting role early. He is going to have some growing pains but if week 3 is any indication he is going to be big in long term. #6 Baker Mayfield/Tyrod Taylor, Cleveland Browns (1-2-1)      This is the second team in the list that already had two starters who were not on the roster last season. The Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor during the offseason. A month later the Browns picked Baker Mayfield with the number 1 overall pick. Mayfield was supposed to be redshirted this season with Taylor holding the place for the year at least until the Browns are out of Playoff contention. But with Taylor's concussion in Week 3 Thursday Night matchup against the Jets, Mayfield came in late second quarter and helped Browns mount the comeback and give the franchise its first win in 17 games. Browns had a great start to the season, mostly thanks to the defense which stifled Ben Roethlisberger in Week 1. Drew Brees also had a tough time playing against this defense. Browns started 0-1-1 in the first two weeks and entered week 3 as favorites for the first time in almost two seasons.     Tyrod Taylor apart from a couple of plays had a tough start to his Browns tenure. That bad form continued in week 3. The first half of that game was unwatchable with Tyrod under center. But, when Mayfield came into the game, the dynamics changed. Browns offense is fun to watch after a very long time, He made the plays that Tyrod Taylor would hesitate to do.     Mayfield brought the life back into the Browns fans. The stadium was lit during the Second Half. That Second Half started a new era in Cleveland Football History. Mayfield was named a starter for Week 4 and beyond as expected. On his first start though Mayfield came back to earth against the Oakland Raiders.     Mayfield threw for two touchdowns but also had four turnovers which resulted in 21 Raiders points. Mayfield showed off his athletic skills, but also showed it was premature to make him a HOF player after that amazing second half in week 3. It is going to be interesting to see how the Browns and Mayfield will continue the rest of the way in all of a sudden new look AFC North that has Steelers tied at the bottom of the table instead of the top. #5 Sam Darnold, New York Jets (1-3)      Darnold was the only rookie quarterback who was named the starting quarterback prior to week 1. He had to earn the job in a battle with Teddy Bridgewater. Both Darnold and Bridgewater had a good preseason leading the Jets to trade Bridgewater to Saints and announce Darnold as a starter. Unlike other rookies, Darnold had an impressive start to his career. He completed 76% of his passes for 198 yards, 2 TDs and a pick with an impressive 116.8 rating. But after that, he came back crashing to earth. He had 4 more INTs to only 2 TDs in the remaining three games.         Darnold had his first career game without any interception in week 4 against a very good Jacksonville Jaguars defense. That should be considered a minor victory for a rookie QB who is struggling after a strong start. Unlike other quarterbacks, Darnold isn't surrounded by high flying talent. His receivers and the running backs are well below league average. In order to succeed long-term, the Jets need to provide weapons around him as the Bears did with Mitchell Trubisky this year, which helped him go off in week 4. Quincy Enunwa and the receivers need to step up and help the rookie QB to have any shot this year. Patriots, who had a slow start are getting back their groove right in time with Julian Edelman returning from his suspension. Jets will be facing a tough Denver defense in week 5. if Darnold could escape that game without a Turnover, they could have a very good chance to escape with a W. He could take some pointer from his veteran backup and mentor Josh McCown.     #4 Alex Smith, Washington Redskins (2-1)  Alex Smith has been his typical self to start the 2018 season with his new team the Washington Redskins. He has a completed nearly 70% of his passes and scored 4 Touchdowns with a pick and a 2-1 record. That is a typical Alex Smith stat line. Smith had a good start for his redskins tenure against the Cardinals, where he threw for 255 yards and a couple of TDs. But, in week 2 against a mediocre Colts defense Smith couldn't find the endzone even though completing nearly 72% of his passes. He and the Redskins bounced back in week 3 against the Packers where he outplayed Rodgers to upset the Packers.     Smith success correlates with the success of the running game. in the two wins, the Redskins new running back, Adrian Peterson rushed for nearly hundred yards and has scored a TD at least once, in the loss against the Colts he rushed 11 times for just 20 yards. Smith is one of those QBs who needs all the dominoes around him should work efficiently to find the success. He does not commit any back-breaking mistakes but he does not even get you out of the gate if fallen behind. NFC East is vulnerable right now and Redskins sit on top of the division even with their bye on week 4. The one difference between the Chiefs and the Redskins is that they lack that dynamic pass catcher that could help a QB out. Jordan Reed had some success in the wins but Jamison Crowder has yet to find the rhythm. It will be interesting to see if Smith can help out the Redskins to remain on top of a very close NFC East race as he did with the Chiefs the past few Seasons.     #3 Case Keenum, Denver Broncos (2-2)  Case Keenum, an undrafted free agent out of the University of Houston, had one of the most unprecedented journeys to become the starting quarterback of Denver Broncos. After his amazing career year in 2017 with the Vikings, Keenum signed a 2 year 36 million dollar contract with the Broncos. But, so far Keenum was not able to replicate the kind of success he had last season. Keenum had a total of 7 INTs in 2017 season has already thrown for 6 so far in four games and just tossing three touchdowns. Keenum's decision making at times seem erratic. He is trying to do more than what the defenses are giving him.     Even with his erratic play Keenum found some early success in the first two weeks by having two clutch game winning drives, which Broncos did not have last season. He almost had a third game winning drive on the MNF, week 4 against the Chiefs. He overthrew a wide open Demaryius Thomas which could have resulted in a game winning TD. In the next play he did connect to the rookie Courtland Sutton in an old-school hook and ladder play call.         Keenum, just like Smith is a game manager who needs to have a better player all around him. He has a solid running game with the two rookies, Royce Freeman and Phillip Lindsay sharing the work load, but the receivers apart from Emmanuel Sanders haven't really stepped up. The reason for having Keenum just a tick above the Last year with Vikings Keenum had Thielen and Diggs who had some amazing catches that helped out Keenum. Keenum knows that Demaryius Thomas is no longer in that elite group and need to be more careful forcing the ball into the tight coverage. The reason I have Keenum a tick above Alex Smith is that of his Clutch performance in weeks 1 and 2 and his NFC Championship game appearance just a few months back. I still think that Keenum is an upgrade to what Denver had last season and could help them have a fighting chance to at least grab the Wildcard spot in the playoffs.     There is no panic yet in Denver, there is a lot of season left and with no viable back up option left this will be Keenum's Season. If he can clean up the turnovers, this Denver team could be in hunt for a playoff spot in December. #2 Kirk Cousins, Minnesota Vikings (1-2-1)  Kirk Cousins, signed a monster contract with the Minnesota Vikings this offseason. After reaching the NFC Championship game a year ago with Keenum under center, the expectations very sky high for the Vikings fans. Some even considered this a Superbowl or bust move.     If indeed it is a Superbowl or bust move, the Vikings are off to a terrible start. They opened the season with a W against the 49ers but tied it up in week 2 with the Packers thanks to some head-scratching roughing the passer penalties. But the real stunner cam in Week 3 when Vikings and Cousins looked almost clueless against a bad Buffalo Bills team who scored a combined 23 points in the remaining three games. Cousins was shutout for three quarters, he had a couple of strip sacks an INT and it was late in the 4Q that he tossed a TD almost in garbage time. Apart from that one week, Cousins was his usual self he completed nearly 70% of his passes, tossing 10 Touchdowns and just 2 picks. He has 1,387 yards in just 4 games and yet the record is 1-2-1 record.         Cousins tenure so far remained same like his Redskins tenure where he played very well when was not pressured too much. But, when pressured his performance goes down. In 2018 so far his rating when the pocket is clean was 112.2, but when he is pressured it dramatically drops down to 89.8. Cousins even brought his fumbling issue from Redskins to Vikings, in which he is second most to fumble the ball since 2015. The Vikings O-line performance has been masked by Keenum's athleticism last season of avoiding the sacks, which Cousins clearly lacks. If Vikings need to find success with Cousins under center they need to provide a clean pocket and give him time to make the plays that Keenum couldn't have done last season. The NFC North looks very interesting with Chicago Bears on Top with Packer right next to them. If the Vikings need to be in the Playoffs in a very tough NFC they need to keep teh pocket clean for Cousins.     #1 Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs (4-0)  Patrick Mahomes is not a new player that was signed or added this offseason but he is the new starter for the Kansas City Chiefs after they traded Alex Smith to the Redskins. Mahomes did start in week 17 of last season but still, this is the first season as a full-fledged starter and thought he should be in this conversation. After the kind of start he had, he certainly should be.     Mahomes had one of the best starts since the Peyton Manning's record-breaking 2013 season. Mahomes even broke the Manning's record of 12 total touchdowns by tossing 13 through weeks 1-3. During the first three weeks, Mahomes was off to fast starts putting up 20+ points to start the game and make the opposing offenses play catchup to the Chiefs. The real test for Mahomes came in week 4 against a very good Broncos defense in a very rowdy Denver environment in Monday Night Prime-time slot. He had a slow start where Denver's defense had his number during the first three quarters. But he remained calm and made some timely passes in the fourth quarter resulting in one of the most thrilling matches in 2018 season so far.         The most amazing fact about Mahomes' performance so far in 2018 is that he has yet to throw an interception. In his four starts this season he has 15 touchdowns and zero picks. This INT-less streak should be attributed to his redshirt year in 2017 under Alex Smith. There is no better player to learn from how to remain interception-free. Mahomes performance so far is a reminiscence of Deshaun Watson's performance for Houston Texans last season. Mahomes is bound to be regressed in coming weeks, which could happen very well in week 5 against a very strong Jaguars defense, who allowed only a total of 4 touchdowns. The sky is the limit for Mahomes and this Kansas City offense. All they could ask for is the defense to play some average level play who currently are last in passing yards allowed. If the defense is not improved, a very good offensive season could very well be ruined come January. Mahomes, distanced himself from others atop of the MVP race, not a bad way to kickoff your first full season as a starting NFL QB. Let's hope the football gods spare Mahomes that bit the likes of Wentz and Watson last season during their own MVP campaigns.

59,Robert Griffin III,"['NFL fans bury Robert Griffin III on Twitter over wild Kobe Bryant-Lonnie Walker IV comparison - ""Stay off the weed""  Fans are far from enthused by former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin\'s comparison of Lonnie Walker IV and Kobe Bryant.  Walker has been a revelation for the Los Angeles Lakers since joining early this season from the San Antonio Spurs. In Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday, he came off the bench for 15 points on 67% shooting as his team took a commanding 3-1 lead.        One of the biggest fans of Walker\'s performance has been former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III. On Twitter, he compared the guard/forward to legend Kobe Bryant and had a unqiue stat comparision with the late Lakers legend.

Back in the world of football, Robert Griffin III recently gave a bold prediction regarding who would win the upcoming season\'s collegiate title. On Twitter, he posted a video of himself saying that the Clemson Tigers will win the National Championship in 2023. In the video, he begins by describing the benefits of Clemson\'s coaching change:     ""Dabo Swinney realized that his offense was archaic and he went outside of his system, went and got a young offensive mind in Garrett Riley from TCU and now they\'re going to be able to build a system with the perfect quarterback for that system in Cade Klubnik. He just has a thing about him that draws people into him and he gets the best out of them."" Robert Griffin III@RGIIIClemson will be a SERIOUS National Championship Contender this year because Dabo Swinney realized the offense was ARCHAIC and stepped out of his comfort zone to fix it.1105134Clemson will be a SERIOUS National Championship Contender this year because Dabo Swinney realized the offense was ARCHAIC and stepped out of his comfort zone to fix it. https://t.co/CWHZhke4pB     Griffin expressed his excitement at how the Tigers would fare when the action begins in September:""I\'m very excited for them. I think that this is a growth moment for Dabo Swinney who always tends to promote from within, so I think Clemson will actually shock the nation and be in the running for a national championship.""     ', 'Aaron Rodgers’ ayahuasca use causing Packers’ problems, claims Robert Griffin III  Aaron Rodgers shocked the NFL world during the 2022 offseason when he admitted to using ayahuasca. He claims the psychedelic drug has helped him improve his mindset, leading to him becoming a better quarterback for the Green Bay Packers.  NFL analyst and former quarterback Robert Griffin III shared his thoughts on the situation and how it may be affecting his overall performance this season. He spoke out during an episode of Monday Night Countdown during Week 9 of the 2022-23 NFL season.        ""In order for [the Packers] to dig themselves out of this hole, they need the best version of Aaron Rodgers. And right now, that ayahuasca seems like it has him in a completely different world.""           Awful Announcing@awfulannouncingRG3 on Aaron Rodgers: ""In order for [the Green Bay Packers] to dig themselves out of this hole, they need the best version of Aaron Rodgers. And right now, that ayahuasca seems like it has him in a completely different world."" 19829RG3 on Aaron Rodgers: ""In order for [the Green Bay Packers] to dig themselves out of this hole, they need the best version of Aaron Rodgers. And right now, that ayahuasca seems like it has him in a completely different world."" 🏈 https://t.co/4anEdmcRSY RGIII seems to believe that Aaron Rodgers\' experimentation with ayahuasca is negatively impacting the Packers this year. They currently have a disappointing 3-6 record, including losing each of their last five consecutive games.      How has Aaron Rodgers performed for the Packers since taking ayahuasca? Rodgers\' use of psychedelics hasn\'t been panning out favorably this season. Aaron Rodgers claimed the first time he experimented with ayahuasca was during the 2020-21 NFL offseason while in South America. There\'s no way of knowing for sure if the psychedelic deserves any of the credit. However, Rodgers proceeded to have two of the best seasons of his career immediately following his experience.         He was named the NFL MVP for both the 2020 and 2021 NFL seasons. He combined to throw 85 touchdowns to just nine interceptions while exceeding 4,000 passing yards in each of them. He also helped the Packers to a combined 26-7 regular season record. The 2022-23 NFL season has been a much different story. It\'s also the first year since the Packers traded away Davante Adams. The receiver evidently played a key role in the quarterback\'s success in the previous few seasons. In the wideout\'s absence this year, Rodgers has thrown just 14 touchdowns across his first nine games of the season. He also threw seven interceptions.While it\'s hard to substantiate RGIII\'s claims, it remains interesting to draw correlations between Rodgers\' performances and his use of ayahuasca.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Monday Night Countdown and H/T Sportskeeda     ', 'Robert Griffin III in demand after insane 40 yard dash  Robert Griffin III may be known to new NFL fans as a football analyst, but recently he shook off the cobwebs and ran a blistering 40-yard dash. Participating in the ""Run Rich Run"" charity event during the NFL draft, he posted a remarkable time of 4.48 seconds. To put that into perspective, it was 0.07 seconds faster than what he ran in his own NFL Combine performance.  Rich Eisen Show@RichEisenShowWhen you run a 4.48 40-yard dash, even if for charity and #RunRichRun, people take notice — @RGIII talked with us about it and how he\'s gotten phone calls from #NFL execs about a possible return and where he\'d like to go:#DallasCowboys#DirtyBirds #GoBears30444When you run a 4.48 40-yard dash, even if for charity and #RunRichRun, people take notice — @RGIII talked with us about it and how he\'s gotten phone calls from #NFL execs about a possible return and where he\'d like to go:#DallasCowboys#DirtyBirds #GoBears https://t.co/kpsdiRAZMc        Since then, he has been contacted by several NFL teams, who will be hoping he is back to his mobile best. He has been open about wanting to play again if the opportunity arises. The Dallas Cowboys, Atlanta Falcons and Chicago Bears are his franchises of choice. He already has a get-out clause in his analyst contract which allows him to leave should a professional football team come calling.           But all of this begs the question, why is he out of the game? The answer to that lies in various injuries during his career. Injuries forced Robert Griffin III out of the league Philadelphia Eagles v Washington Redskins     Griffin III was chosen by the Washington franchise in 2012 as the second overall pick of the draft. He made his name in college as a dual-threat quarterback and did not disappoint in his first season. In his rookie year, he won the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. He led the now Washington Commanders into the postseason and contributed to 27 regular touchdowns in the regular season. His 7 rushing touchdowns led the league. But issues were bubbling under the surface as he had to miss the Pro Bowl with ACL and LCL injuries to his right knee. After surgery, he did not play in the preseason and in 2013 failed to replicate his rookie season form. In the final three games of the season, he was benched to avoid further injuries. In 2014, he missed seven weeks due to a dislocated ankle sustained in Week 2. In 2015, he suffered a nasty concussion during the preseason. After such a glut of injuries, he slipped to third on the depth chart and Griffin III left Washington at the end of the season.     In 2016, after being named the starting quarterback with the Cleveland Browns, he dislocated his shoulder in the opening game. He only returned in Week 14 but was let go at the end of the season. Griffin III remained a free agent throughout 2017. Returning as a backup in 2018 with the Baltimore Ravens, he finally got a chance to start in 2019 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Unfortunately, he tweaked his left hamstring during that game. With so many injuries on his record, especially for a quarterback whose threat was his mobility, teams did not want to take the risk of signing him. When this became apparent, he gave up the field for the booth. Robert Griffin III@RGIIIDon’t tell people your plans, show them your results.19133Don’t tell people your plans, show them your results.But his recent 40-yard dash might once again convince the team that he is back to his best shape and ready to contribute again. If Griffin III can prove himself and stay fit, we really might see him again in the NFL.     ', 'NFL fans want RGIII canceled for using slavery-era racial slur: ""Totally unacceptable"", ""He wanted to sound cool he doesn\'t know what that means""  Robert Griffin III, better known as \'RGIII,\' is in hot water. The former Washington Commanders quarterback went a bit too far while analyzing the Philadelphia Eagles\' big win over the New York Giants during ESPN\'s pregame show. This was before the Monday Night Football clash between the New England Patriots and the Arizona Cardinals.  Jalen Hurts finished the game with 217 passing yards, two touchdown passes, 77 rushing yards, and one rushing touchdown. When discussing his performance, RGIII said:        ""People said Jalen Hurts couldn\'t get it done. He couldn\'t operate from the pocket. He\'s not the quarterback of the future. I think he proved all those j****os wrong.""           Those at the table alongside the former NFL quarterback were also caught off-guard.

It remains to be seen whether ESPN will punish the former Washington Commanders quarterback for using such a term on live TV.While it\'s plausible that the use of the slur was nothing more than an unfortunate error, the implications could be dire for the former NFL star. Fans on social media aren\'t buying the apology, and bosses at ESPN might also resonate with that sentiment by punishing Griffin for his error.     ', 'NFL world grills Broncos QB for terrible performance vs Seahawks  Russell Wilson\'s Denver Broncos debut did not go according to plan in his week one Seattle homecoming. Denver were favorites heading into Monday night\'s clash against Seattle, however, it was the home team that emerged victorious.  For Wilson, it wasn\'t his best night, he regularly missed throws and there were plenty of penalties on the offensive side of the ball.        He did finish with 340 yards passing and a touchdown, but it was what happened on the last play of the game that had us scratching our heads. Faced with a fourth-and-five, Denver head coach Nathaniel Hackett opted to trot kicker Brandon McManus on the field for a 64-yard field goal. Instead, what many thought Hackett would do was keep Wilson and the offense out there to convert and get closer to Mcmanus\' range.           The NFL world took notice of this with Fox Sports\' Undisputed Skip Bayless tweeting if Denver was sure about their franchise quarterback. ""Denver, are you SURE about Russell Wilson?""

Justin Fields of the Chicago Bears is having a great second season and Jalen Hurts is having a stellar third season with the Philadelphia Eagles.  Looking at some of the veteran signal-callers, Kirk Cousins is having a great fifth season with the Minnesota Vikings. Also, you cannot forget Super Bowl-winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes for the Kansas City Chiefs.

Here are the stats for Justin Fields, Jalen Hurts, Kirk Cousins, and Patrick Mahomes thus far this season: Quarterback Passing Yards TD (Passes) Interceptions  Passer Rating Justin Fields 1,489  12 7 86.4 Jalen Hurts 2,042  12 2 107.8 Kirk Cousins 2,356 14 8 87.0 Patrick Mahomes 2,936 25 7 106.1         Fields and Hurts have rushed for at least 300 yards this season. Here\'s a breakdown of the rushing numbers for them: Quarterback Rushing Yards Rushing Touchdowns Justin Fields 749 6 Jalen Hurts 326 6      When looking at the four quarterbacks, Mahomes is leading the league in both passing yards and touchdowns. Hurts has a better passer rating and has thrown the fewest interceptions among the quarterbacks listed. To Robert Griffin III\'s point, Tua Tagovailoa has had a great 2022-2023 season as well.    The Miami Dolphins star has thrown for 2,265 yards, 18 touchdowns, and three interceptions so far. He has the highest passer rating at 118.4 and is tied for third in touchdowns. Tagovailoa has had an impressive campaign for Miami and is looking to lead them to glory this season. With so many talented quarterbacks, such a feat will be extremely tough.With almost two months of the regular season remaining, we\'ll see which quarterback is named the league\'s best at the end of the campaign. It will be interesting to see who wins the league MVP in the 2022 season.     ', ""What was Justin Fields’ 40-yard dash time? Revisiting Bears’ dual-threat QB’s pro day performance  To succeed as a quarterback in the NFL, one must possess more qualities than just arm power and precision. The role is dynamic and appears to be becoming more physically demanding with each new NFL draft class. The NFL Combine is the ideal venue to display such agility and quickness.  Anyone who saw Justin Fields compete at Ohio State during his two-year stint knew that he was a very talented player. However, Fields demonstrated just how quick he was at his pro day on campus.        SportsCenter@SportsCenterJustin Fields was MOVING  He ran 4.44u at Ohio State Pro Day.(via @NFLBrasil) 9240849Justin Fields was MOVING 💨 He ran 4.44u at Ohio State Pro Day.(via @NFLBrasil) https://t.co/NnCEJuJC4V           Before Justin Fields' Ohio State pro day in 2021, it was assumed that he would be selected among the top ten in the NFL draft. By performing pleasantly during his training, he only served himself. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Fields had an unofficial 40-yard sprint mark of 4.44 seconds, which ranked as the second-fastest speed for a quarterback in 15 years. While many scouts estimated his unofficial timing at that point, one estimated it to be 4.43 seconds. The only quarterback to beat Fields' time at the Scouting Combine since 2006, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter, was Robert Griffin III, who ran a 4.41 at the Combine in 2012.     USA TODAY NFL@usatodaynflHello, Justin Fields. 82Hello, Justin Fields. https://t.co/ws9FgPUU7D After launching his career at Georgia, Fields threw for 5,373 yards, 63 scores, and nine interceptions during his two years at Ohio State. Is Justin Fields the fastest quarterback in the league now? There are various perspectives on quarterback quickness. The 40-yard dash time is typically the default; however, not all QBs run a 40 at the Combine. Lamar Jackson did not participate in the Combine's running event, but at Louisville's Speed Day in 2017, he had a time of 4.34, making him the league's quickest active quarterback. Justin Fields tops all current quarterbacks with the fourth-fastest official Combine 40-time since 2000 after clocking a 4.44 at the 2021 NFL Combine.     NFL@NFLJustin Fields. 4.43u SPEED.

(via @movethesticks) @justnfields📺: @OhioStateFB Pro Day on @nflnetwork https://t.co/Wu1B2XACNg When Fields ran for 41 yards against the Dallas Cowboys at 21.23 mph, it was the quickest run by any quarterback in the entire 2022 season. Thanks to that run, he was the 15th-fastest carrier on any play last season.In addition, Fields became just the third quarterback in NFL history to surpass 1,000 rushing yards in a season. Before Fields, only Michael Vick and Lamar Jackson had amassed 1,000 running yards while serving as quarterbacks.Fields accomplished this feat, among other things, by making amazing runs, eluding defenders, and flying off at breakneck speed.     "", ""NFL: What is next for Dwayne Haskins?  News broke on Monday that the Washington Football Team had released quarterback Dwayne Haskins, an expected move after his performance against the Carolina Panthers in what was a must-win game for Washington to secure a spot in the playoffs.  Haskins had his ups and downs in the 2020 season, as the second-year QB started the first four games of the season, going 1-3. He was benched and demoted to third-string QB after that and Kyle Allen was named the starter, with veteran Alex Smith as the backup.        Washington Football Team QB Dwayne Haskins Jr. took a sack on this play.You’ve got to be kidding me...#WashingtonFootball pic.twitter.com/78arXCmU0x— WFT Analysis | #BeatPHI (@WFTanalysis) December 28, 2020           Shortly after that, Allen suffered a season-ending leg injury, giving head coach Ron Rivera a difficult decision to either start Smith or Haskins. Eventually, Smith became the starting quarterback with Haskins being his backup. It wasn't expected for Haskins to ever see the field again unless Washington couldn't make it to the playoffs, but the day came when Smith was injured against the San Francisco 49ers and Haskins took over for the next two and a half games. His performance was average at best but was simply not good against the Panthers last week.      Will Dwayne Haskins ever see the field again? Many believe that Haskins' career as an NFL QB is simply done for. But since his rookie season, he has shown signs of being a star quarterback for a team willing to take a risk. Haskins is considered an old-school quarterback and not as mobile as many up-and-coming QBs in the league currently. That was one reason why he wasn't taken ahead of New York Giants' quarterback Daniel Jones in the same draft class. The fact of the matter is that Haskins needs to sit for a whole season behind a seasoned veteran, similar to Alex Smith. Teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers, New England Patriots, Atlanta Falcons, and even the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could sit a young guy who needs to mature over time to show what he can do on the field again. Wishing the best for @dh_simba7 You are only 23! Learn from this and bounce back— Robert Griffin III (@RGIII) December 28, 2020     He may not have worked out in the system that Washington has created, but Haskins could work out elsewhere. The situation brought to Haskins reminds us of Josh Rosen, who was drafted in the first round and then cut after one season with the Arizona Cardinals.Since then, he has been around a few teams and on practice squads. But Haskins certainly has more talent than Rosen, it's simply a matter of time and maturity for the former Ohio State quarterback.     "", 'Lionel Messi once met Alex Ovechkin who called it a \'once in a lifetime opportunity to meet the best player\' in soccer  In a remarkable meeting of sports icons, Washington Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin found himself in awe of soccer superstar Lionel Messi. The encounter took place in 2018 at Fed Ex Field in Landover, Md., where Messi was preparing for Argentina\'s friendly match against El Salvador.  Alongside Ovechkin stood his teammate Evgeny Kuznetsov and former Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III, creating a star-studded gathering.        For Ovechkin, who is accustomed to meeting fans who admire him, this meeting with Lionel Messi was a dream come true. Speaking to Monumental Network, he expressed his admiration for the soccer legend, acknowledging Messi\'s status as one of the best athletes in the world. Ovechkin\'s appreciation extended to Kuznetsov as well, who shared the honor of being in the presence of Messi. Ovechkin recognized the significance of the moment, referring to it as a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet the current best player in soccer."" Messi, at the age of 27, was dominating La Liga with an impressive tally of 32 goals in 28 games for FC Barcelona. Meanwhile, Ovechkin, 29 at the time, was making waves in the NHL with 47 goals in 73 games for the Washington Capitals. His exceptional performance put him on track to potentially secure the Rocket Richard Trophy as the league\'s leading goal-scorer. As an ardent Barcelona fan and Messi enthusiast, he regarded the encounter as a tremendous honor. Comparing Messi\'s stature to legendary athletes like Michael Jordan, Mark Messier, and Wayne Gretzky, Ovechkin emphasized the magnitude of meeting such an esteemed figure.     Eager to commemorate the occasion, Ovechkin presented Messi with a signed No. 8 Capitals jersey, symbolizing the mutual respect shared between the two sporting greats. Excited about the encounter, Ovechkin promptly shared a photo of himself with Lionel Messi on Twitter, accompanied by the caption: ""Just wow!!! The best!!!!!! Leo Messi!!!!""

In awe of Messi, he confessed to being nervous and even shaking during their meeting. Such was the impact of encountering a player of Messi\'s caliber.     ']"
60,Blaine Gabbert,"['Anthony Richardson vs Cam Newton: Comparing Gators QB\'s combine performance against former Auburn star  Anthony Richardson is one of the most polarizing prospects of the 2023 NFL draft. The former Florida Gators quarterback is touted as a first-round quarterback, but there are doubts about whether his skills will be able to translate to the NFL.  Richardson\'s performance at the 2023 NFL Scouting Combine on Saturday should improve his draft stock after a fantastic day. While his athletic ability was never in doubt, he broke long-standing records and his blazing speed caught the attention of observers.        The 21-year-old broke the record of the longest vertical jump for any quarterback since 2003 by scoring a 40.5\'\' jump. The 6\'4\'\' quarterback also ran an excellent 4.44 in the 40-yard dash, one of the fastest-ever for a passer. Anthony Richardson\'s athletic excellence drew comparisons to other former Florida quarterback, Cam Newton.            Both are two strong-armed quarterbacks with threatening rushing ability. How do the two players compare in their Combine performances?  Is Anthony Richardson more athletic than Cam Newton? Comparing the two quarterbacks Although the latest Florida quarterback broke the vertical jump record today, he\'s very similar to Cam in many athletic aspects NFL Research@NFLResearchAnthony Richardson just broke the record for the highest vertical jump (40.5"") by any QB at the combine since at least 2003 @FloridaGators #NFLCombine67597Anthony Richardson just broke the record for the highest vertical jump (40.5"") by any QB at the combine since at least 2003 @FloridaGators #NFLCombine https://t.co/cmWChmoqq0     When Newton performed in 2011, he all but cemented his status as the first overall pick for that year\'s draft. His only real competitor that year was Blaine Gabbert, who ended up in the 10th overall pick with the Jacksonville Jaguars - Jake Locker was taken with the eighth overall pick by the Tennessee Titans. Anthony Richardson\'s competition is higher this year, as Alabama\'s Bryce Young and Ohio State\'s CJ Stroud are set to be the first two quarterbacks taken. However, the excellent Combine performance alongside his great work ethic and some good interviews can improve his stock even further, perhaps landing him in the draft\'s top 5. Having a good athletic profile can cut you a lot of flack in the league, especially as it relates to things such as completing passes in short windows or escaping the pocket to get yards on the move. These are two things that Newton was excellent at, and the Florida star can become a great quarterback with the same playing style.     ', 'Ranking the 10 Worst NFL QBs of the 2010s  Quarterback is the most important position in the NFL and that won’t change for as long as the sport is played.  Over the past decade, we’ve seen some simply stupendous players throw the ball in the NFL, keeping fans astounded on a weekly basis. They impressed one and all with their feats of magic with the ball in their hands.        Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson have all but revolutionised their positions since being drafted, yet not every player can have such a positive impact. As is impossible to avoid, for every success story in the NFL, there is an equally negative outcome for another individual.           The 2010s saw some quite awful quarterback play from a number of guilty parties. Some were so bad that an infamous play is now named after them, whilst others failed to live up to expectations due to an out-of-control off-field life.  Who were the 10 worst NFL quarterbacks of the 2010s? #10 Geno Smith Baltimore Ravens v New York Jets     Geno Smith had talent at the quarterback position, but describing his career in the NFL as a negative snowball would be an understatement. However, it\'s not entirely his fault that he arrived at a poor New York Jets team that was bereft of leadership and veteran presence who were used to winning. After being drafted in the second round of the 2013 NFL Draft, Smith would hugely struggle with interceptions in his first two years, throwing a grand total of 34. He didn’t inspire any confidence within the locker room either. This ultimately culminated in an unfortunate incident. His own teammate, IK Enemkpali, broke his jaw with a right hook that left Smith out injured for most of the 2015 season. He never regained his place, and has since gone onto become a backup option with the Giants, Chargers and Seahawks. But in terms of quarterback production, Smith stands as one of the worst of the 2010s.      #9 Blaine Gabbert Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Jacksonville Jaguars Thrown into the dumpster fire that has been Jacksonville football for the best part of a decade, Blaine Gabbert has had a forgetful NFL career. It is worth nothing, however, that he is classed as a Super Bowl winner. Gabbert rode Tom Brady’s coattails to a championship in Tampa Bay, throwing a grand total of 27 passes in three years. But he remains one of the most disappointing picks of the previous decade. Picked 10th overall in the 2011 NFL Draft, Gabbert had a below average rookie year where he threw just 12 touchdown passes, as well as 11 interceptions. He was also sacked 40 times and fumbled the ball on 14 occasions.     It was a setback that he never recovered from, with the Jacksonville Jaguars never really having patience with him as a long-term starter again.  #8 Mark Sanchez New England Patriots v New York Jets Picked up by the New York Jets with the fifth overall pick in 2009, Mark Sanchez was supposed to save NFL football in the Big Apple. Instead, he is somehow remembered the most for his ""butt-fumble."" Ironically, the four years he had as a starter in New York were four of the better years the Jets have had for a long time. They had a strong roster that just needed a better quarterback. Sanchez made too many mistakes, some at the costliest moments, and that became his legacy.     He never finished a season with the Jets without at least nine fumbles. The butt-fumble was the worst of the lot. Not only did Sanchez misread what the play was supposed to be, but he didn’t have the awareness to know where his own O-Line were positioned. While attempting to slide to safety to avoid Vince Wilfork, he slid into the backside of one of the O-Line members, fumbling the ball in the process. Tobey MaCrier@shaneysmalls@BarstoolPhilly The Sanchez Butt Fumble@BarstoolPhilly The Sanchez Butt Fumble https://t.co/I9DqLmnCEW New York soon lost patience and Sanchez was out, with a specific QB training session called ""The Sanchez Program"" to eliminate QB fumbles being created.      #7 Jake Locker Tennessee Titans v Houston Texans The 2011 NFL Draft saw another QB taken earlier, with Jake Locker going to the Tennessee Titans at #8. When an NFL career lasts four seasons, with a player being a nailed-on starter in just one of them, that tells you everything you need to know. Locker was a backup in his rookie year and was then chosen to lead the Titans in his second year. In 11 starts, he threw for more interceptions than touchdowns and fumbled the ball four times.     Injuries followed, but Locker couldn’t escape the poor performances when he was on the field. He retired in 2015 citing a loss of passion for the sport, cementing his place as one of the biggest busts of the 2010s.  #6 Brandon Weeden Cleveland Browns v Denver Broncos Another name on the lengthy list of Cleveland Browns QB failures, Brandon Weeden arrived in 2012 as the 22nd pick at 28 years of age. His professional MLB career began with the New York Yankees in 2002, yet just a decade later he was in the NFL.     You have to commend the work ethic, but his career in professional football went exactly as you’d expect. He started 15 games as a rookie, throwing 14 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. These stats are alarming, but nowhere near as bad as some on this list. However, he just lacked the pop needed to survive in the NFL. His passes were simply not accurate enough and he was never going to take the team to the next level. Weeden\'s poor displays saw him constantly benched throughout his second year in Cleveland, and he was released at the end of the 2012 season.  #5 Christian Ponder Minnesota Vikings v Green Bay Packers     The sample size of Christian Ponder as an NFL quarterback is admittedly much larger than that of others on this list. But that just purely gives us more evidence to understand how bad he was. Given the starting job in Minnesota for three seasons after being drafted 12th overall in 2011, Ponder’s returns were woeful. His entire career with the Vikings ended with 38 touchdowns and 36 interceptions, as well as 20 fumbles. Ponder struggled to read defenses, even three years into life in the NFL, and he panicked as soon as any defender got near the pocket. He was one of those players who simply didn’t have the makeup to be an NFL quarterback.  #4 Josh Rosen Arizona Cardinals v Seattle Seahawks     Josh Rosen arrived into the NFL with a lot of hype as part of one of the most stacked QB draft classes in years. He was selected 10th overall by the Arizona Cardinals in 2018, but doubts were raised about his abilities and fit immediately. He would start just 13 games in his one and only year in Arizona, throwing 14 interceptions to 11 touchdowns. Rosen was sacked 45 times and fumbled the ball on 10 occasions to boot. It was a historically bad year for the Cardinals QB, and ironically one which helped the franchise out immensely. They were able to pick first overall in 2019 and got Kyler Murray, the replacement for Rosen. The latter was traded immediately to Miami, where he would start just three games, losing all of them whilst throwing just one touchdown and five interceptions. Rosen didn’t play at all in 2020 with the San Francisco 49ers, whilst in 2021, he threw just 11 passes all season, two of which were interceptions.     It’s hard to fathom the 10th overall pick being bounced between four teams in as many years. As a free agent in 2022, his NFL career is essentially over, and it is one of the most forgettable in living memory.  #3 DeShone Kizer Green Bay Packers v Baltimore Ravens Cleveland features heavily on this list, unsurprisingly, and DeShone Kizer was another name they drafted and spat out after years of disappointing performances. Hue Jackson wanted Colin Kaepernick signed, but received Kizer and oversaw the latter play his part in the 0-16 season.     Kizer started a full 15 games in the 2017 NFL season, but his performances were appalling. He completed just 53.6% of his passes, threw double the number of interceptions to touchdowns with 22 and 11 respectively, and fumbled the ball nine times. The fact that he led an NFL team to only the second ever 0-16 season is telling, and he never got to be a starter again. Kizer was traded to Green Bay after his rookie year, where he would throw 42 passes, no touchdowns and two interceptions. He has not played an NFL snap since and is unlikely to ever do so again.  #2 Johnny Manziel Cleveland Browns v Buffalo Bills     The only thing stopping Manziel from reaching the top spot on this list is that he had some natural talent as a quarterback. It’s almost entirely his own fault that he had such an abysmal career in the NFL. Selected by the Browns, every quarterback’s favourite franchise, Johnny Football entered the NFL as a celebrity before he had achieved anything at the pro-level. A rookie QB being fined for a hand-gesture made towards opposing fans in a pre-season loss is almost unheard of. Yet Manziel made it a reality. He would be judged accurately by the Browns’ coaching staff, who started Manziel in just two NFL games in 2014. He threw two interceptions and no touchdowns. Many expected 2015 to be the comeback year for Johnny Football. He was settled in Cleveland, but that proved to be his undoing as he appeared to party constantly. That year, he started six games and threw seven touchdowns to five interceptions, but his play was nothing more than below average by quite some distance.     A domestic violence incident was the last straw for the Browns. They were so desperate to get rid of Manziel, theyeven released a statement suggesting his future would be addressed ""as soon as permitted by league rules."" He never played in the NFL again.  #1 Paxton Lynch Atlanta Falcons v Denver Broncos Paxton Lynch was never a first-round calibre quarterback. He was then thrown into an awful situation created by the Denver Broncos and their mismanagement of Peyton Manning’s retirement. Once in the NFL, Lynch was just awful.     He would never do enough to convince the Broncos that he was starting QB material. Lynch played for the defending Super Bowl champions and threw just two touchdowns in his rookie season. His second season was no better, as he struggled to even get time on the field. The Broncos knew he was a bust and the rest of the watching world did too. Josh Kellem@JoshuaKellem#Broncos traded up for Paxton Lynch during 2016 #NFLDraft he\'s now getting outplayed by Case Cookus(?) in the #USFL if patient, team could\'ve drafted Dak Prescott on Day 2. crazy Lbroncoswire.usatoday.com/2022/06/07/usf…1#Broncos traded up for Paxton Lynch during 2016 #NFLDraft he\'s now getting outplayed by Case Cookus(?) in the #USFL if patient, team could\'ve drafted Dak Prescott on Day 2. crazy Lbroncoswire.usatoday.com/2022/06/07/usf… He threw 128 passes in the NFL with four being touchdowns and four being interceptions. For a first-round selection, that is a dreadful return on investment.     Lynch then had spells on the practice squads of Seattle and Pittsburgh, never doing enough to earn a deal. His NFL career was as short as it was dismal as a result.He was most recently picked in the 12th round of the United States Football League draft after playing as a third-string QB in the Canadian Football League.     ', ""Shannon Sharpe claims Tom Brady’s coaches are on chopping block after loss to Panthers: “They're about to come for you”  Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have a lot of issues to deal with on the offense. Whether it's the quarterback, other offensive players or even coordinator Byron Leftwich, something clearly needs to change.  On FOX Sports' Undisputed this morning, NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe expressed his opinion on who will take the brunt of the blame for Brady and the Bucs' struggles. And it's not the seven-time Super Bowl winning quarterback.        UNDISPUTED@undisputed.@ShannonSharpe reacts to Tom Brady's performance in 21-3 loss to the Panthers:21329.@ShannonSharpe reacts to Tom Brady's performance in 21-3 loss to the Panthers: https://t.co/55qBsu956M           Sharpe believes that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers coaches will be the ones taking the heat for the dysmal start, not the players. Most specifically, Leftwich and head coach Todd Bowles. Sharpe said that when the Bucs lost, it is never Brady's fault, but when they won, he got all of the credit. He continued by saying that Brady and his offense's inability to get any production isn't the fault of the defense. But Bowles, who is the defensive play caller, will continue to take the heat for all of it.     Sharpe's final message was that it wasn't fair that the veteran quarterback doesn't suffer the blame or harsh criticism that everyone else around him will endure. Shannon Sharpe: [00:02:27] the Bucs have the third fewest offensive touchdowns this season Shannon Sharpe: [00:02:41] He's on this list with the Panthers Baker Mayfield, PJ Walker and the Bears Justin Fields that field. Look at those guys. He's on that list. Shannon Sharpe: [00:03:11] But let me tell you who will get the blame. LEFTWICH They've got to come for you, Todd Bowles. They're about to come to your defense. They're about to come for you. They're always going to place the blame on somebody else when you lose. Other than Tom Brady. But when they win they get no credit. Todd Bowles don't get no credit. The defense doesn't get any credit. ‘Tom Brady, did you see that throw? He wills them to win it.’ They won because of him. But when they lose, they lose because of everybody else. Is that fair? How is that realistic? You and I both know he was awful. The Bucs are now 26th in third down conversion rate. In the last two games, he's six of 26. What does the defense have to do with that? What does the defense have to do with that? Absolutely nothing.        Would the Bucs ever bench Tom Brady for a younger QB? The Indianapolis Colts announced on Monday afternoon that they had benched quarterback Matt Ryan and will start second-year quarterback Sam Ehlinger for the rest of the season. The Bucs have now lost four of their last five games, the last win was a 21-15 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, which didn't come with controversy over penalties.         Would Tampa Bay ever follow Indianapolis' lead and bench their veteran quarterback Tom Brady? That's not likely for a few reasons. The Colts have apparently been planning this for a while. They moved Ehlinger up to second on the depth chart above Nick Foles, just a few weeks ago.

While Trask was finally given an opportunity to showcase his skills during the preseason, it's unlikely the Buccaneers will give him a chance while Brady is still on the roster. But that's not saying that Trask won't surpass Gabbert after the veteran quarterback has officially retired.It's also the overall fact that benching Matt Ryan is a completely different situation than benching a seven-time Super Bowl winning quarterback who has been in the league for 23 seasons.     "", ""Tom Brady breaks tablet during Saints loss  Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady wasn't happy with his or his team's performance last night. It was evident by his body language, especially for those who are good lip readers.  Late in the game, after throwing another interception to the New Orleans Saints, Brady seemed to have had enough with the tablet he had been reviewing all night.        Brady took the tablet, which appeared to be damaged already, and threw it behind the bench he was sitting on.

After struggling last season in his first game in the NFC South against the Saints, Brady and the Buccaneers were able to get a win on the road to advance to the NFC Championship game.     Brady and the Bucs have now lost four straight regular-season games to the New Orleans Saints. But after a tough loss on Halloween to the Saints, the Buccaneers were looking to get redemption on Sunday night to clinch the division title. That goal will have to wait another week. The Saints were all over Tom Brady, leading him to just a 54.2% completion rate and 214 passing yards and a fumble. The outing is clearly the worst performance by Brady this season, who may have been making a case for the MVP award. The Bucs were shutout 9-0, with neither team scoring a touchdown. It was the first time Brady has been shutout in 15 years, or 315 NFL games. Brady's frustration wasn't taken out on only the Microsoft Surface tablet. During the game, he was seen yelling at referees. He was even seen yelling at the New Orleans Saints' sideline at one point.

Brady attempted 36 passes, completing 20 of them for 211 yards (average of 5.9 yards per pass), four touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 109.8.        The quarterback played so well that he did not even finish the 38-3 win, and second-string quarterback Blaine Gabbert had Tampa\'s last snap.           But such a dominant performance was not enough to make Brady happy. In fact, after the game, when driving home from the stadium, Brady was angry at himself because he knew his team could have had an even bigger win.

Winning at that clip does not come without hard work, dedication to his craft and his body, and help from the many great teammates in New England as well as Tampa. Like all great players, Brady wants more and more. There is no ceiling to his ambition, and that is what makes the long-time New England Patriots quarterback scathe at the fact that a 35-point victory is enough to satisfy himself and his teammates.Unquestionably, Brady knows that he and the team were as perfect as they could be against the Bears. Unfortunately, there is no true perfection. Fortunately, there is the pursuit.     ', ""NFL Free Agency: 3 QBs to back up Tom Brady in Tampa Bay this season  After a successful offseason, the reigning NFL Super Bowl champions Tampa Bay Buccaneers look primed to repeat last season's heroics.  The Bucs extended star veteran quarterback Tom Brady's contract, while trimming $19 million off their salary cap. This allowed the Bucs to bring back the majority of the team that won Super Bowl LV against the Kansas City Chiefs.        Now, while the greatest quarterback in NFL history, Tom Brady, is expected to start every game for the Bucs, who will serve as his backup?           Here are three backup quarterback options for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Last year's backup Blaine Gabbert          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Blaine Gabbert (@blainegabbert) The Bucs re-signed Blaine Gabbert, the man who backed up Tom Brady last season in Tampa, to a one-year deal. Bucs GM Jason Licht has suggested that Gabbert could be the heir to Tom Brady, once the G.O.A.T decides to finally retire from the NFL.     Gabbert has played ten seasons in the National Football League after being drafted 10th overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2011. He has played 60 games, throwing 50 touchdowns and 47 interceptions with a career QBR of 72.3. 2021 NFL Draft pick Kyle Trask          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Kyle Trask (@ktrask11) Rookie Florida quarterback Kyle Trask was drafted 64th overall by the Tampa Bay Buccanneers this year. With a 44-year-old starting QB, it made sense for the Bucs to select a quarterback for the future.     Blaine Gabbert will have the inside run to be the backup for Brady but if Trask can impress in pre-season, he could be the third-string QB in week one. Trask will be able to learn from the best in the business under Tom Brady, which will help speed up his NFL development. He played 27 games in his college career, throwing for 7,386 yards, 69 TDs, and 15 interceptions for a QBR of 168.5. Free Agent QB Robert Griffin III Pittsburgh Steelers v Baltimore Ravens     A wild-card option for the Tampa Bay Buccanneers is a player who is not yet on their roster - former NFL Offense Rookie of the Year Robert Griffin III. The number two draft pick in the 2012 NFL Draft has been plagued by injuries and inconsistent performances. RG3 has thrown 42 touchdowns with 30 interceptions in his NFL career.Now an eight-season NFL veteran, Griffin could be the perfect third-string QB behind Gabbert and Brady. He also brings a different style of play compared to Tom Brady, which the Bucs could implement when required.      "", 'Antonio Brown ran the wrong route on his touchdown catch\xa0  It\'s hard to decipher whether Lady Luck was with Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the Super Bowl or whether the team is made up of phenomenal players.  Tom Brady had a commanding performance on the day. Rob Gronkowski was hard to suppress. Patrick Mahomes struggled against the Bucs\' formidable defense as they coasted through Kansas City with a 22-point lead.        In fact, Tampa Bay were so good that when their wide receiver ran the wrong route, the play was executed for a touchdown.           Quarterback Tom Brady threw a perfect laser from the one-yard line to wide receiver Antonio Brown in the end zone with six seconds left in the first half for a touchdown. But the play was not executed as planned.

Antonio Brown was expected to go in and then come back out. But he did the reverse, going out and then in, and yet he managed to secure a touchdown. ""That\'s where Brady doesn\'t get thrown for a loop. He just hits the guy. \'Hey, you get open, I\'ll hit you.\' That\'s where he\'s pretty darn unique. A lot of quarterbacks are, \'Hey, he\'s supposed to do this: A to B to C.\' This guy A.B. goes C to F back to A and he just hits him for a touchdown,"" said Christensen. Maybe it was Lady Luck or just a testament to the star quality players Tampa have. Not only did Antonio Brown reach safety Tryann Mathieu, but Brady too did not panic and threw to Brown when he was open.

And A.B. is just...since he got here, he\'s just done everything the right way. So impressed by him. Proud of him. It takes a lot of people for us to get to this point. We all have great support systems in place and I think everyone should be celebrating them tonight,"" said Brady.     While none of the players were directly asked about the touchdown, Antonio Brown was quick to praise his QB. ""It\'s been a tremendous honor working with Tom, man. He\'s a legend. He\'s a winner.

', 'NFL Pre-Season: Tracking the Quarterback battles    The current NFL pre-season offers the fans the chance to watch a number of key positional battles play out. Who will be the Packers starting running back? Who will emerge as the Patriots best receiving option opposite Danny Amendola? Who will take over from Steven Jackson as the featured back in St Louis?        But no positional battle captures the attention of the league quite like the quarterback position, and this August we have a number of very intriguing quarterback battles taking place around the NFL. There is still a long way to go, but with week one of the pre-season in the books, let’s check in on the progress being made at the most open quarterback battles around the league, and find out who is edging ahead with less than a month to go before the regular season kick off on September 5th.           Buffalo Bills – EJ Manual and Kevin Kolb  Just by reading the stat line it seemed that Buffalo’s 2013 first round pick, rookie quarterback EJ Manual, had quite a good first game for the Bills. He finished the game a respectable 16 of 21, with a quarterback rating of 102.6. He also threw for a touchdown in the dying seconds of the first half to break a tie in the game, going nearly perfect on the preceding two minute drive. As a bonus, the young quarterback avoided being sacked.     However, if you delve a little deeper into the stats, you will realise what was immediately apparent to everybody who watched the game; his performance wasn’t actually all that impressive. Manual was playing very simple check-down football, averaging only 5 yards per completion. Further, the rookie’s seemingly impressive 2 minute drill, which led to his only touchdown of the game, came against the Colts 3rd string defence. That takes some of the gloss of what initially looked like a stellar performance. However, it is important not to undersell Manual. There are positives to be seen from his performance. It wasn’t EJ’s fault that he was asked to execute a simple passing game plan. And to his credit, he didn’t really make any mental mistakes during the game, going through his reads properly and finding the open receiver consistently. I would call his first game in the NFL solid if not spectacular.     It is a good start for the rookie, but let’s not get carried away just yet. Veteran thrower Kevin Kolb, who was brought to Buffalo by former general manager Buddy Nix this off season, is by no means out of this race. Kolb is going to start in tonight’s second pre-season game against the Minnesota Vikings formidable defence, so let’s see how that plays out. As things stand right now, I think Manual still has to be considered the favourite for the job. In a tight race, it’s a safe bet to follow the money, and the Bills are well invested in their first round pick. But if Kevin Kolb puts on a show tonight in Buffalo, who knows what could happen.  New York Jets – Mark Sanchez and Geno Smith  Probably the most publicised quarterback battle throughout this pre-season has been and will continue to be that of the Jets; the shaky veteran vs the unproven rookie, Mark Sanchez vs Geno Smith.     Sanchez, coming off an embarrassing season last campaign, opened this year with a seriously stupid pick straight to the hands of Lions rookie defensive end Ziggy Ansah. To his credit, though, Sanchez regained his composure after that and actually had a solid outing. He finished the game with a respectable stat line of 10 of 13 for 125 yards and a touchdown on three series. After being considered the favourite to win the job before training camp opened in July, Geno Smith is having a bit of a rough time of it lately. He really didn’t do enough to overtake Sanchez against the Lions, before leaving with an ankle injury. Things got worse for Geno after the game. Reports have indicated that he has continued to struggle on his ankle, noticeably limping on the practice field and looking uncomfortable during his reps. His struggles culminated in what was his worst day of practice on Wednesday, as the rookie hit a rough patch throwing four interceptions. His own head coach, Rex Ryan, admitted as much in a post-practice press conference:     “It was brutal. It was Geno’s worst day, I think. And obviously, the ankle’s part of it, but … way too many picks and things. Did not look comfortable today,” There is still a long way to go in this race, but if Geno is limited in tonight’s game against the Jaguars (and reports indicate that he might be), then that could hand Mark Sanchez the perfect opportunity to start to pull away as the Jets starting quarterback. Keep your eyes fixed firmly on these two over the next three weeks.  Jacksonville Jaguars – Blaine Gabbert and Chad Henne  Someone is going to have to win the Jacksonville Jaguars starting quarterback job, but will it really make a difference? To be brutally honest, the likelihood is that this team is going to suck regardless. Having said that, let’s take a look at how the race is unfolding anyway. We’ll start with Blaine Gabbert, who did stand out this past week…just in the worst way possible. The young quarterback threw the ball 10 times in the Jacksonville Jaguars’ preseason opener against the Miami Dolphins; he gained only 19 yards on those throws and threw an interception. That’s appalling by any standard you want to measure him against. Gabbert looked uncomfortable, out of rhythm and pretty much no improvement on the quarterback who was benched at the tail end of last season. With new coach Gus Bradley in town, Gabbert’s position as the starter might be in jeopardy. Bradley didn’t draft Gabbert, and so he will have no problem sitting him on the bench.     That would leave Chad Henne as the starting man. Henne didn’t set the world alight by any means during his snaps, but at least he doesn’t look completely useless. His numbers (8 of 11 for 87 yards) were solid if unspectacular, and he looks like a much safer option under centre for the Jaguars. With the state of Gabbert’s play at the moment and following on from last season, it’s hard to ignore the fact that right now Henne looks by far the better option in Jacksonville. Although to head coach Gus Bradley, it probably feels more like the lesser of two evils. He’ll be looking for one of them to show a lot more in week 2 against Rex Ryan’s New York Jets.  Philadelphia Eagles – Mike Vick and Nick Foles  Both of the Eagles quarterbacks carried themselves well in the pre-season opener, which gives new head coach Chip Kelly the sort of selection headache every head coach wishes he could have.     Mike Vick, who started the game against New England, looked in good touch against the Patriots starters. Vick threw a couple of beautiful passes, including a laser to Jason Avant down the seam and a deep toss to DeSean Jackson down the right sideline for a touchdown, to finish his series with a stat line of 4 of 5 for 94 yards and a touchdown. He looked poised in the pocket and displayed an accuracy that had been missing at times over the course of last season. Nick Foles also acquitted himself well when he came in, throwing 5 of 6 for 43 yards in his short time on the field. However, Foles did commit a turnover; the young thrower fumbled after being hit from behind whilst attempting a throw at the end of the first quarter. The growing feeling around camp is that this is Mike Vick’s job to lose, but Foles will get the chance to change that around tonight. Head coach Chip Kelly has already announced that Foles will be the starter in the Eagles second pre-season game against the Carolina Panthers. With the Panthers front seven being talked about as potentially one of the best in football, this should be a good test for Foles to prove himself worthy of the starting gig. If he can perform with the starters as Vick did last week, he could gain some valuable ground in one of the most intriguing quarterback battles of pre-season.

Chad Henne couldn't beat out Blake Bortles at his worst, which is not the best news for Chiefs faithful. #29 Miami Dolphins Starter - Ryan Tannehill, Backup - Brock Osweiler Tannehill will be playing for his job Brock Osweiler can't be described as the best backup policy for Tannehill, who is coming back from a knee injury last season. The coaching staff is in the hot seat and sharing the division with Patriots does not help.     #28 Washington Redskins Starter - Alex Smith, Backup - Colt McCoy Alex Smith will have to bring his MVP season from Kansas City Alex Smith might live up to his MVPesque season from last time but McCoy would live on as a below average backup QB forever. Alex Smith ain't the worst option after Kirk Cousins left. #27 Houston Texans Starter - Deshaun Watson. Backup - Brandon Weeden Deshaun Watson will have to be the player he was before the injury     Houston has Weeden as their backup to their sophomore superstar coming off an ACL injury, O'Brien would hope for a better option than that. The team hopes to stay fit next season and do some damage in AFC. #26 Dallas Cowboys Starter - Dak Prescott, Backup - Mike White, Cooper Rush Prescott will get his sidekick in Ezekial Elliott back for the season Dak and Zeke form a formidable offense but the Cowboys quarterback room could do better than Mike White and Rush. Jason Garrett must be hoping for Kellen Moore (probably not).     #25 Cincinnati Bengals Starter - Andy Dalton, Backup - Matt Barkley Dalton will have to bemoreconsistent upcoming season Cincinnati Bengals have changes looming in front of them, the coaching staff is in the hot seat and the QB room ain't helping. Andy Dalton has been used to define the term 'average' all over the NFL dictionary and Barkley never lived up to his high school potential. #24 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Starter - Winston, Backup - Ryan Fitzpatrick Tampa Bay will not have Winston for the first 3 weeks per suspension     Winston will serve his ban and Ryan Fitzpatrick will be QB-1 in the depth chart, sounds depressing, probably is. #23 Baltimore Ravens Starter/ Backup - Joe Flacco, Lamar Jackson. The QB competition is in full swing at Ravens camp Ravens' coaching has been immensely impressed with rookie Lamar Jackson. The reports from preseason indicate that Joe Flacco has been showing more initiation as well. Ravens will be looking to capitalize on a soft AFC. #22 Chicago Bears Starter - Mitchell Trubisky, Backup - Chase Daniels Trubisky can lead Bears to playoffs and become the greatest franchise QB     Bears have a new offensive system and Chase Daniel as the backup, who has come from the Chiefs system that Matt Nagy will be running. Trubisky needs to live up to his draft pedigree and Bears can easily jump to the next tier. #21 Buffalo Bills Starter - AJ McCarron, Backup - Josh Allen, Nathan Peterman The team will hope for Josh Allen to win the starting job Bills brought in McCarron from Bengals as an insurance policy to their Rookie, Josh Allen. Bills have an average starter, one raw rookie, and a backup with starting capabilities in Peterman. No one should be surprised if everyone gets a start in Buffalo.     #20 Denver Broncos Starter - Case Keenum, Backup - Paxton Lynch, Chad Kelly Keenum will hop to fill the big shoes of Peyton Manning Case Keenum had a career year last season but he won't have the similar support cast as Minnesota. Paxton Lynch has bust written all over him and won't even command a conditional pick in return. #19 Tennessee Titans Starter - Marcus Mariota, Backup - Blaine Gabbert Mariota needs to bounce back from a dreadful last season     Titans have been a run first team but Mariota needs to improve his play for them to compete against Houston in the division. Gabbert can be a great backup in the correct system with his cannon arm and great mobility. #18 New York Giants Starter - Eli Manning, Backup - Davis Webb/ Kyle Lauletta Eli Manning will have to deliver with the run game to support Eli Manning has lost way too many steps to be a top tier QB but his stellar offensive sidekicks should take him to the belief land. Davis Webb has been making a lot of noise this offseason along with Kyle Lauletta at the backup position.     #17 Oakland Raiders Starter - Derek Carr, Backup - Connor Cooks Derek Carr will have to gel into Gruden's offense sooner than later Derek Carr underachieved last season. Cook and Carr will soon realize that life under Gruden is not as rosy as Gruden Camp. The team has Jeff Fisher vibes of finishing 8-8. #16 Detroit Lions Starter - Matthew Stafford, Backup - Matt Cassel Stafford can rise up to the next level     Stafford has one of the best arm seen in the sport but he needs a better support cast. How does Matt Cassel still have a job in NFL, even though it is as a backup? #15 Atlanta Falcons Starter - Matt Ryan, Backup - Matt Schaub Matt Ryan can bring the Falcons to the top Matt Ryan has had a legendary career till now, without winning the big one. The bad news is that they have Matt Schaub as the backup. #14 New Orleans Saints Starter - Drew Brees, Backup - Tom Savage     Drew Brees will look to take Saints further than last time Saints are moving on to a more run-heavy offense which might help the longevity of Brees. Saints are one of the big boys of NFC and Brees would love to make one last run before father time gets him. Tom Savage is not what you dream of as a backup but Saints don't have an option. Hill is the scout team QB who is turning heads at camp. #13 Seattle Seahawks Starter - Russell Wilson, Backup - Austin Davis     Russell Wilson will look for some help from the run offense Russell Wilson is a one-man offense for Seahawks with zero run game, no O-line help and below par receiving core. Russell Wilson does it all but sadly Austin Davis can't. The diminishing quality of Seahawks defense makes their chances of playoff dim. #12 Los Angeles Rams LA Rams - Starter - Jared Goff, Backup - Sean Mannion Goff will look to improve on his stellar performance last season     Jared Goff took a big leap last season. Sean McVay has been a godsend to Rams offense. Sean Mannion is not the best backup option but he has been in the system and a good subordinate to the young future of Los Angeles. Goff is a sneaky MVP candidate with Gurley by the sides. #11 Pittsburgh Steelers Starter - Roethlisberger, Backup - Mason Rudolph/ Landry Jones Roethlisberger will look to capitalize on Bell's last year in Pittsburgh Steelers have a complete offense led by Big Ben. His two quarterback understudies are raw and with minimal arm talent. Roethlisberger has been injured in bits and pieces over the last few seasons and the weak backup situation doesn't help the Steelers.     #10 Los Angeles Chargers Starter - Rivers, Backup - Geno Smith/ Cardale Jones Rivers will be looking for some luck and support from the fans Rivers is a great starter with a competent backup in Geno Smith. The run game led by Melvin Gordon with the receiving talent of Keenan Allen would be a handful for any defense. If the team stays fit, they can be a challenger for the AFC title. #09 San Francisco 49ers Starter - Jimmy Garoppolo, Backup - CJ Bethard Jimmy G will look to become Jimmy GQ     Garoppolo ended the 49ers season last year with 5 wins. The only way for the 49ers is up. Kyle Shanahan has one of the most sophisticated offenses in the league. CJ Bethard as the backup is a little suspect. Bay area is waiting for Jimmy G to become Jimmy Jesus. #8 Cleveland Browns Starter - Tyrod Taylor, Backup - Baker Mayfield/ Drew Stanton Baker and Tyrod will look to bring back the glory at Cleveland Browns were the worst team in Football but they have added to every position on the pitch. Taylor is a dependable QB, who can give you 5 wins on his worst day. Baker is the future with great football ethics and Drew Stanton will be a great third QB while developing a rookie. Browns look like a sneaky break out team for the upcoming season.     #07 Green Bay Packers Starter - Aaron Rodgers, Backup - DeShone Kizer Rodgers will be without his favorite wide receiver next season Rodgers has been known to hide most of the blemishes of his team. Packers traded for Kizer to be the backup, who was the QB of a 16 loss team. The addition of Jimmy Graham at tight end position will come as a great help after Nelson left. #06 New England Patriots Starter - Tom Brady, Backup - Brian Hoyer/ Danny Etling Brady will look to defy father time for one more season     Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time. Brian Hoyer is definitely not the greatest backup quarterback of all time. Brady's age is a sign of trouble but he is the reigning MVP of the league. Patriots have drafted Danny Etling in the late rounds who could turn up to be a great option for the future. #05 Indianapolis Colts Starter - Andrew Luck, Backup - Jacoby Brissett Luck finally looks set to be back alongside promising backup in Brissett If Andrew Luck wasn't coming back from injury, Colts could have been the top team in this exercise. Brissett has been a great trade by Colts. Luck has started training again and the revamped offensive line won't hurt either. The future looks bright for the franchise.     #04 New York Jets Starter/ Backup - Darnold, Josh McCown, Bridgewater Jets will have one of the most balanced quarterback room No one expected Jets to end up this high on the list but they have a great experienced starter and teacher in Josh McCown. They arguably got the best quarterback from the recent draft in Sam Darnold and they signed Teddy Bridgewater for free in the offseason. Bridgewater is the biggest trade asset in the league and front-runner for the comeback player of the year. Jets have stability at the position for the first time in a long time.     #03 Minnesota Vikings Starter - Kirk Cousins, Backup - Trevor Siemian Cousins will be expected to live up to his price tag The future looks bright for the franchise. Kirk Cousins is underrated even after being the costliest player in football and Siemian is as good a backup as any. Vikings will try to make the run in a loaded NFC. #02 Arizona Cardinals Starter - Sam Bradford, Backup - Josh Rosen/ Mike Glennon Rosen will look to earn the starts while Bradford needs to stay fit     The Cardinals have one of the most polished QB coming out of College in Rosen. Sam Bradford can be a top 15 quarterback when fit. The quarterback room compliments each other, unlike any other team. Cardinals can shock a lot of people next season. #01 Philadelphia Eagles Starter - Carson Wentz, Backup - Nick Foles Eagles would love another Philly special, with Wentz this time Nick Foles just won Philly the Superbowl, while the future MVP of the league (Wentz) was sidelined with an injury. Eagles have things sorted till Foles gets traded for too many draft picks. The Eagles QB room might just help them reach the mountaintop again. The in-depth look into every quarterback room made me realize that Matt Cassel, Matt Schaub, and Landry Jones will keep having backup jobs in 2096 and no one will ever notice. In conclusion. my biggest fear is that Blake Bortles will end up winning the Superbowl and make this article as irrelevant as his throwing motion.

61,Mason Rudolph,"[""3 takeaways from Dwayne Haskins' performance in the Hall of Fame Game  Whether or not Dwayne Haskins has a future in the NFL is likely to be decided in the 2021 NFL preseason.  Sure, it's a lot of pressure, but it's the reality of the situation. Haskins was selected 15th overall by the Washington Football Team in the 2019 draft. What followed was a tumultuous two seasons with the Football Team.        In his two years in Washington, Haskins had 2,804 passing yards and 12 touchdowns, sub-par numbers at best. What was even more unsettling was that Haskins threw 14 interceptions. His production was underwhelming, to say the least, but it's not what ultimately got him released.           The final nail in his coffin at WFT was reportedly a poor work ethic and a lack of leadership skills. Luckily for Haskins, the Steelers had an ongoing battle for the backup quarterback spot and felt signing Haskins to compete for the role was worth the risk. In Thursday's preseason opener in Pittsburgh, all eyes were on Haskins. It was his first chance to change the narrative surrounding his skills as an NFL quarterback. With the dust settled on Thursday's game, here are three takeaways from Haskins' performance on the night. 3 takeaways from Dwayne Haskins' showing  #1 - He has a real shot at the number two quarterback job     The battle to back up Ben Roethlisberger is a three-man race between Haskins, Mason Rudolph and Joshua Dobbs. Rudolph is the favorite to win the job as he's been Roethlisberger's backup quarterback for the past two seasons. That said, the backup quarterback job is still very much undecided. The position battle will ultimately be decided by the top performer in training camp and preseason action. For this reason, Thursday night's first preseason game was of huge importance to Haskins, Rudolph, and Dobbs. All three quarterbacks played a good amount of snaps against the Cowboys. Rudolph finished 6/9 with 84 passing yards and one fumble. Meanwhile, Haskins was 8/13 with 54 passing yards. Dobbs played the fewest snaps but also had the game's only passing touchdown. He ended the game 4/6 with 37 passing yards, one touchdown and one fumble. Looking solely at the stats, Haskins' performance wasn't worth noting. Dig a little deeper, and it was clear Haskins had his moments.     Dwayne Haskins’ best throw of the night. Linemen’s right leg is between Haskins’ base he and can’t step up.His ability to improvise arm angles and arm strength are on display as he’s able to nicely place the ball in front of the receiver. Great throw!Looked confident tonight. pic.twitter.com/CLm5DEwLR6— Zareh Kantzabedian (@ZKantzFF) August 6, 2021 He commanded the offense, was poised, and made some good throws. His decision-making was also more reliable than that of Rudolph or Dobbs. Just one above-average preseason game won't win Haskins the number two quarterback job, but it does make it clear that he has a real shot. #2 - He's much more careful with the football Part of what made Haskins such a liability on the field with the Washington Football Team was his proneness to turning the ball over.     As previously mentioned, Haskins has 14 interceptions in the 16 regular-season games he's played in his career. That's not the only problem, though. Haskins has 12 career fumbles, six in both the 2019 and 2020 seasons. Twelve fumbles in only 16 career games played makes for one of the highest fumble rates in the NFL. With turnover issues of that magnitude, it was important to see how Haskins would take care of the ball in the Steelers' preseason opener. Haskins had zero turnovers Thursday night. He was about as careful with the football as he's ever been. Ironically, Haskins was the only Steelers quarterback to not fumble the football. It's important to keep in mind that this was only one game. Yes, Haskins was much more efficient, but this is something he needs to do consistently to be a productive quarterback. How he takes care of the ball in preseason game number two will be intriguing to watch.     #3 - The upside is still evident Although it never worked out in Washington, it was always clear that Haskins has the potential to be a good quarterback. Look no further than his 2018 season with the Ohio State Buckeyes to see how good Haskins can really be. He threw for 4,831 yards and had 50 passing touchdowns.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Dwayne Haskins, Jr. (@dh_simba7) He flashed some of that same potential on Thursday night. When Haskins is dialed in, his upside is tremendous. The problem throughout his NFL career is that he hasn't always been dialed in.Some of the on-the-field struggles Haskins faces can be fixed through good coaching. However, concerns about Haskins' work ethic and leadership can only be fixed by himself. If he can get himself right in those departments, he'll have a bright NFL future because his natural talent is very much still there.     "", ""3 major talking points from Dwayne Haskins' performance as he fights for a roster spot  The Pittsburgh Steelers played their final preseason game Friday as they faced off against the Carolina Panthers. The game had many implications regarding players trying to secure a spot on the roster this season. One specific player had a tremendous amount of pressure to perform well. That player being: Dwayne Haskins.  In today's press conference, Coach Tomlin said that Dwayne Haskins will start at QB against the Panthers on Friday. pic.twitter.com/zk7jcIUIF5— Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) August 25, 2021        The Steelers were defeated by the Panthers in dominating fashion. The final score was 34-9 as Pittsburgh looked woefully unprepared, and the offense that Dwayne Haskins was leading appeared to be nonexistent.           Here's a look at three takeaways from the Steelers' final 2021 preseason game. Dwayne Haskins will not be the backup QB Haskins, 24, finished with a staline of 9-for-16 completed passes for 108 yards, a touchdown and an interception. The Steelers offense struggled mightily and conjured up a touchdown on their final drive as a result of garbage time. His touchdown score was merely stat padding as his play throughout the game didn't match the numbers he finished with. Dwayne Haskins got a start against the #Panthers No. 1 defense tonight. He's 3-of-7 for 24 yards with an interception and the Steelers have 32 yards through 20 minutes of football.— Grant Paulsen (@granthpaulsen) August 28, 2021     Mason Rudolph has underperformed throughout all of training camp, but his experience with the Steelers, coupled with Haskins' inability to perform outside of practice, will grant the former the backup position this upcoming season. Haskins may not make the Steelers roster After a disastrous stint with the Washington Football Team, the former first-round pick failed to show any improvement during his time with the Steelers. IN his two years with Washington, he threw for 2,804 yards along with 12 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. Dwayne Haskins' talent is undeniable, however hhe consistently fails to comprehend NFL playbook's and it's on full display every time he walks on to the field. Mike Tomlin doesn't tolerate players that are unprepared come game time. Meaning, Dwayne Haskins' brief tenure with the Steelers could very well be coming to an end in the coming days. The Steelers still need to find Big Ben's successor     Mason Rudolph clearly isn't the answer to succeed Ben Roethlisberger when all is said and done. There was hope that maybe Haskins could be that answer, considering he was the 15th overall pick in the 2019 NFL draft.Unfortunately, the Steelers' attempt to make another man's trash their treasure failed. With Roethlisberger entering season 18 at the age of 39, it's imperative that the front office find his replacement.Haskins could still potentially be that guy. But as of now, his play has proven otherwise and it remains unclear if he'll even make the roster this season.     "", 'Steelers\' QB starting competition - Mike Tomlin\xa0  The Pittsburgh Steelers got their man in the draft when they were able to land Kenny Pickett with the no. 20 overall pick in the first round last week.  Pittsburgh Steelers@steelersWith the 20th pick in the #NFLDraft, we select QB Kenny Pickett. #SteelersDraft250657560With the 20th pick in the #NFLDraft, we select QB Kenny Pickett. #SteelersDraft https://t.co/8IDyASLOmz        Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin spoke with NFL Network\'s Rich Eisen about the quarterback competition in Pittsburgh.              Tomlin said: ""I expect it to be fierce because I know all three guys. I don\'t expect anyone to take a backseat."" He went on to say: ""The challenge is from a structure standpoint. Are we providing enough of a platform for all the guys to show what they\'re capable of? I\'m excited about watching these guys compete.""     He then said: ""So, we will proceed with that understanding that it\'s going to be challenging from an organization standpoint, but it\'s a good challenge and I\'m excited about watching those guys perform.""

Often times, those are two variables that really require a lot of adjustment from a quarterbacking standpoint. Hopefully, that\'s an asset to him in terms of being able to compete and being ready, if his performance dictates it.""     He concluded: ""One of the things that was very evident about Kenny being next door is he\'s just a ridiculous competitor, so we\'re just excited about putting him in the mix and watching him compete against Mitch and Mason and seeing where that leads us."" Mitchell Trubisky, Kenny Pickett and Mason Rudolph to compete for Steelers QB position Detroit Lions v Pittsburgh Steelers     For the first time in years, there\'s a quarterback competition in Pittsburgh. For the last 18 years, Ben Roethlisberger was the franchise quarterback, but he retired at the end of the 2021 season. With he retired, the Steelers added Mitchell Trubisky in the offseason.    Pittsburgh signed Trubsiky to a 2-year $14.25 million contract. They also added quarterback Kenny Pickett in the draft. Mason Rudolph was already on their roster as a backup to Roethlisberger The Steelers finished the season 9-7-1, squeezing into the playoffs thanks to a remarkable sequence of events. They beat the Baltimore Ravens 16-13 in overtime, the Indianapolis Colts lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars and then a last-second overtime field goal prevented a tie between the Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Chargers.     The Wild Card round proved to be a humbling 21-42 defeat at the hands of the Kansas City Chiefs, eradicating any hopes of a third Roethlisberger Super Bowl win.Heading into the season, coach Tomlin has made it clear that the best man will win the quarterback job. Each quarterback will have to show that they\'re the best man to lead the Steelers this season.     ', ""Steelers could land themselves a Ben Roethlisberger replacement in Jimmy Garoppolo  The Pittsburgh Steelers suddenly need a new quarterback now that Ben Roethlisberger is officially set to retire. The in-house options of Mason Rudolph and Dwayne Haskins don't excite fans, and may even have some worried that those two will compete for the starting job.  Both should be in a competition in general. However, a consistent winner like the Steelers seem poised to go out and acquire a proven talent. Remember, the team has never had a losing season under Mike Tomlin. Why start in 2022?        Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson are the home run options for Pittsburgh. The problem is that neither is confirmed to be ready to force a trade out of their respective cities. And even if they do, Pittsburgh isn't automatically a top choice.           This puts the name of Jimmy Garoppolo into the mix as a realistic option. We know he is on his way out of San Francisco because the team drafted Trey Lance with the No. 3 overall pick last year. Garoppolo also failed to do enough to lead the 49ers to victory in the NFC Championship Game. A late interception to seal the game also sealed his fate out in the Bay Area. Kyle Madson@KyleAMadsonYou can criticize Jimmy Garoppolo's late-game performance vs. the Rams and also have a healthy appreciation for how he handled this season and what he did for the 49ers since arriving in 2017.2:51 AM · Jan 31, 20221586117You can criticize Jimmy Garoppolo's late-game performance vs. the Rams and also have a healthy appreciation for how he handled this season and what he did for the 49ers since arriving in 2017.     So how can the Steelers go about adding Garoppolo to their roster? The Steelers have a safe and realistic option at QB in Jimmy Garoppolo NFC Wild Card Playoffs - San Francisco 49ers v Dallas Cowboys The 49ers quarterback is under contract for one more season and carries a salary of $25.5 million. His dead cap is only $1.4 million, so a trade before June 1 is inevitable. The Steelers would also be doing the 49ers a favor here, so it's not like any top picks have to head to them in return. The fact he only has one year remaining lowers his value as well.     Let's say Garoppolo lands in Pittsburgh. He is coming off a season in which he threw for 3,810 yards and 20 touchdowns in 15 games. Those are not mind-blowing numbers, but he has had proven success when healthy. He has only been a full-time starter in 2019 and 2021, and the 49ers went deep into the postseason both times. There is a criticism out there that he was propped up by the team's running game. Well, if he goes to Pittsburgh, fans can still expect Najee Harris to have a huge role in the offense. He himself propped up Roethlisberger this past year, so this isn't some new formula. Michael Beck@MichaelBeck56If the Steelers acquire any veteran quarterback this offseason I strongly think it would be Jimmy Garoppolo8:19 AM · Jan 30, 202280928If the Steelers acquire any veteran quarterback this offseason I strongly think it would be Jimmy Garoppolo     The key here is that the Steelers can get a starter who is ready to go on Week 1 and who can do so without much issue. Trying to land players like Rodgers or Wilson involves lucrative trade packages and convincing as well. Landing Garoppolo is much more straightforward, and something like a second-round pick could even be considered an overpay.The Steelers did not establish a proper succession plan for Roethlisberger. Giving Garoppolo a one-year tryout allows them to stay competitive and also keep their options open for 2023.Also Check Out: Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl Wins     "", 'Is Dwayne Haskins the best replacement for Ben Roethlisberger? Former Washington QB showing great improvements in preseason  Is Dwayne Haskins the best choice as QB2 in Pittsburgh?  Less than nine months ago, QB Dwayne Haskins was released by the Washington Football Team after being the 15th overall pick in 2019. After a decent rookie year, he was named the 2020 starter by head coach Ron Rivera after coming to camp leaner and playing well in the preseason. Dwayne Haskins was benched prior to Week 5 due to a poor work ethic and performance on the field. After breaking COVID-19 protocol several times with the team in playoff contention late in the season, Haskins was released before the end of the season. Rivera stated he was cut because of his poor decision-making and not meeting off-field team standards. The Pittsburgh Steelers signed him to freshen up their competition for QB2 and Ben Roethlisberger\'s eventual replacement. Mason Rudolph has been the backup since 2018 but has yet to secure the spot long-term. Joshua Dobbs is in his second stint with the Steelers and has potential that has never fully been unlocked. Dwayne Haskins opened the 2021 training camp as QB4.        Vintage Dwayne Haskins 😍 pic.twitter.com/7NPC1P4vrH— Barstool OSU (@BarstoolOSU) August 13, 2021           Dwayne Haskins started at the bottom of the depth chart while at rock bottom of his career. After Haskins was cut, it took weeks before the Steelers signed him, and there was no other calls coming in for him. He was a former top-15 pick from 2019 with 50 TDs in 2018 with Ohio State. He later called his release and blown chance in the NFL a ""blessing"" and that playing for his hometown team felt more like a ""burden"". Ron Rivera didn\'t draft him and had zero ties in Haskins\' future. Basically, Dwayne Haskins has the talent when given the right environment and mentors. Since joining Pittsburgh, he has had zero issues off the field and has been a model player.     Throws like this you can\'t teach. Dwayne Haskins is looking good so far. #Steelers #SteelersNation #HereWeGo pic.twitter.com/pA2tsYAe7U— Black and Gold Nation - The Preseason (@B_GNation1) August 13, 2021 Entering training camp, Dwayne Haskins was shaky on the field and many assumed he would be in the first round of cuts. Instead, he started off hot out of the gate in camp with accuracy, TDs, high yardage and big plays. He even led all of the Pittsburgh QBs with 20+ yard completions. As camp proceeded, he eventually cooled off but remained in the battle. In his first 2021 NFL preseason game, Dwayne Haskins went 8/13 for 54 yards (4.2 yards per attempt) as the backup to starter Mason Rudolph. He completed three of his four passes on 3rd down, but never converted. He was credited by head coach Mike Tomlin for being smart on the field, but came up short in the moment.     In Week 1, Dwayne Haskins went off with 16/22 for 161 yards and a TD while scoring on four of his five drives as the backup to Rudolph again. Mike Tomlin praised him for being ""in command"" of the offense by going through his reads well and making good decisions under pressure. Haskins called the game the most fun he has had since being drafted in the NFL. One of his major blunders was a miscommunication on a play and he ran right into the defense while his blockers went the opposite way. Still, he has the edge on Mason Rudolph through two games. Ben Roethlisberger will play in Week 2 versus the Detroit Lions and it\'s unclear who the backup will be. Haskins and Rudolph should split the load, though. Dwayne Haskins performs like a \'jazz player\' in bid to earn Steelers\' No. 2 QB job https://t.co/tUYteNw77E #Steelers pic.twitter.com/km1WWtkwvd— Steelers Depot (@Steelersdepot) August 13, 2021     At this rate, Dwayne Haskins is poised to beat out Mason Rudolph, who could end up being traded in the process. But is he the best fit as Roethlisberger\'s backup? Mason Rudolph plays similar to Ben\'s style, but for the Steelers, Dwayne Haskins is the best option for them. He has the intangibles that Rudolph doesn\'t, but has taken a hit to his mental skills on the field with a shaken confidence. That seems to have been repaired by Pittsburgh, and he\'s shown the same potential he had as a top draft prospect. Haskins is less than a few months into playing in this new system, one new to all of the QBs, and already has the edge in it. We haven\'t seen how Ben Roethlisberger will play in Matt Canada\'s new offense, but Haskins has taken to it better than Rudolph and Dobbs. Haskins won\'t start the regular season barring a major injury to Ben, but if he can continue his success with the offense throughout practice during the season, 2022 could be Dwayne Haskins\' redemption as a starter in the NFL.

He has impressed coaches throughout training camp and took no time to display his talents on the big stage.

Trubisky completed four passes from seven attempts for 63 yards and a touchdown.It will be interesting to see in the remaining preseason games how coach Mike Tomlin uses his three quarterbacks. We still do not know who will be the starting signal-caller in Pittsburgh.     "", ""NFL: 5 best replacements for Ben Roethlisberger at the Pittsburgh Steelers\xa0  Earlier during the offseason, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger restructured his contract to help with his team's cap situation.  In doing so, Roethlisberger also ensured he'll be returning to the fold in the Steel City come September 9th as the starting quarterback. But after 16 fantastic years in the NFL, it's hard to imagine that Roethlisberger has too many more championship-caliber years left in him.        Currently, Mason Rudolph is the Steelers' backup quarterback. If you happened to catch his 2019 performances when filling in for the injured Roethlisberger, then you'll already know they fell beneath the high standards expected in Pittsburgh.           The experience may have aided his progression. But, personally, I don't think Rudolph is the solution in the long term. This of course begs the question of who Roethlisberger's successor will eventually be? Let's take a look. Five potential replacements for Ben Roethlisberger The Steelers have signed Ben Roethlisberger to a new contract, per @RapSheet 24th highest-graded QB in 2020 (69.0) pic.twitter.com/DQMUUJ4mEK— PFF (@PFF) March 4, 2021     #1 - Marcus Mariota (Las Vegas Raiders) Marcus Mariota 2014 Heisman Award-winning QB Marcus Mariota has struggled to live up to expectations in his NFL career. In Tennessee, his abilities seemed to wane year on year and it was no surprise to see him moved on to the Las Vegas Raiders during the 2020 offseason. Mariota has been back up to Derek Carr ever since. That being said, there are two reasons why this signing could work for the Steelers. First, Mariota is out of contract at the end of the 2021 season and has enough experience under his belt to come in and do a job and second, in the one-game viewers really got to see off Mariota last season, he performed quite well.         This performance does suggest that coach Gruden's influence on one of the best college players of all time has been paying off. Besides which, if all else fails, Mariota can simply keep the passing game simple and hand the ball off to Najee Harris, who looks destined to have a tremendous career in the NFL. #2 - Carson Strong (Nevada)        Of all the quarterbacks I've seen this week in preparation for next year's 2022 NFL draft, the Nevada Wolf Pack's signal-caller Carson Strong is certainly the closest to Roethlisberger's style of play. He is potentially a college talent that the Steelers will keep an eye on. Like Roethlisberger, Strong is a traditional pocket-passer blessed with a gun of an arm, accurate delivery, and, at 6-foot-4, a real presence behind the line. Of course, the Steelers could vouch for a host of other quarterbacks in next year's draft. But with 5,193 yards, 38 TDs and just 11 picks in his first two campaigns as a starter in Nevada, Mike Tomlin and co. could do a lot worse than Carson Strong in their quest to replace Roethlisberger. #3 - Drew Lock or Teddy Bridgewater (Denver Broncos) Denver Broncos v Atlanta Falcons     With Drew Lock now vying with the former-Panther, Teddy Bridgewater, for quarterback supremacy in Denver. One of the two signal-callers will likely be deemed surplus to requirements come the 2022 offseason. Teddy Bridgewater threw for 3,733 passing yards, 15 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for Carolina in 2020. Drew Lock managed 2,933 passing yards, 16 touchdowns and 15 picks for the Broncos. With those stats, neither player is likely to pacify a Steelers fanbase used to watching such talents as Terry Bradshaw and Ben Roethlisberger at Heinz Field. But both would be decent stop-gap options if coach Tomlin and GM Kevin Colbert feel there isn't value for them in the 2022 NFL draft. #4 - Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers) Aaron Rodgers is reportedly not happy with the Packers and he has told the organization he does not want to return to the team, per @AdamSchefter Rodgers: PFF's highest-graded player in 2020 (95.1) pic.twitter.com/xTHVEAlZBF— PFF (@PFF) April 29, 2021     Aaron Rodgers wants out of Green Bay. The Pittsburgh Steelers franchise is one of the most renowned and storied in sports. If the quarterback is granted his wish, I'd expect to see the Steelers sniffing around for the 2020 NFL MVP and the quarterback reciprocating the interest. It probably won't happen, but the Steelers have as good a chance as any other team of persuading Rodgers to join their ranks and, of course, he'd be an excellent replacement for Roethlisberger. #5 - Mitchell Trubisky (Buffalo Bills) Mitchell Trubisky: 63.5 PFF Grade in 2020T-32nd among QBs pic.twitter.com/6eOYBFqsJ6— PFF (@PFF) March 18, 2021     Bear with me here. For all the hate he receives for not being Patrick Mahomes, Mitchell Trubisky has still thrown almost twice as many touchdowns as he has interceptions in his short career. He's been to the playoffs twice and he's young enough to improve further whilst learning a more dynamic style of offense under Sean McDermott and Brian Daboll at the Bills training center. And who knows what kind of tricks he'll pick up from Josh Allen over in Buffalo, too. Like my first pick Marcus Mariota, I just don't think Trubisky is over and done with in the NFL just yet. Someone will give him another opportunity, so why not the Steelers next year if Roethlisberger retires?Trubisky lining up alongside RB Najee Harris, WRs JuJu Smith-Schuster, Chase Claypool and Diontae Johnson doesn't sound all that bad to me.Plus, it's not like Roethlisberger didn't have a nightmare season back in 2006 (18 touchdowns, 23 interceptions). Players can improve, and Trubisky deserves another shot.     Also Read: Who is Ben Roethlisberger's Wife, Ashley Harlan?      "", 'Steelers star talks about Pickett-Trubisky competition  This off-season, the Pittsburgh Steelers were put in an unfamiliar situation when quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired after 18 seasons.  All-Pro defensive lineman Cam Heyward spoke about the battle on the Mina Kimes Show.        Heyward thinks that Mitch Trubisky has the edge due to his mobility and with the league turning to a mobile-needed quarterback.           Heyward said: “I feel like now the quarterbacks all have to be able to run. And back then, you could get away. Ben was free to flip for his position back then. You had Brady, Eli, Philip Rivers. Peyton Manning. Peyton now is just known for taking sacks because he didn\'t want to get hit. But these quarterbacks now are very mobile. It\'s a different offense, where you have the RPOs. And you got to be a run factor.""        Heyward added that the question with Kenny Pickett is how far can he get and how quickly he can adjust: ""I think the thing with Kenny is, how far can he get to that level? And how quick does he adjust? Mitch is gonna have a leg up in that regard. He played in Chicago and didn\'t have the best record or the best team around them.”        Steelers have three-man race for QB position, with Kenny Pickett or Mitch Trubisky likely winning it 87th Heisman Trophy Media Availability The Steelers currently have three quarterbacks: rookie quarterback Kenny Pickett, newly-signed Mitchell Trubisky, and regular backup Mason Rudolph.

Tomlin said: ""We thought he had pro-level anticipation. We thought he had pro-level accuracy. Often times, those are two variables that really require a lot of adjustment from a quarterbacking standpoint. We felt he came ready-made in those ways. Hopefully, that\'s an asset to him in terms of being able to compete and being ready, if his performance dictates it. One of the things that was very evident about Kenny being next door is he\'s just a ridiculous competitor, so we\'re just excited about putting him in the mix and watching him compete against Mitch and Mason and seeing where that leads us.""     Pickett was the only rookie quarterback taken in the first round of this year\'s draft. Trubisky has the most experience, starting four seasons for the Chicago Bears.

Garrett looked set to get loose on Friday during the NBA's annual All-Star celebrity game. In a game that's not usually known for delivering mesmerizing basketball highlights, Garrett differed from the norm by showcasing incredible feats of athleticism.        Although his team ultimately didn't win the game, Garrett provided many spectacular highlights that show why he's one of the most gifted players in the NFL.

"", 'NFL QB battles: Predicting winners of top 5 neck-and-neck battles  Over the last few days, two NFL teams have named their starters for the 2021 NFL season.   The Jacksonville Jaguars officially, and unsurprisingly, named rookie Trevor Lawrence as their starter for the upcoming campaign. In Denver, Teddy Bridgewater won the quarterback battle and Drew Lock will serve as the backup.         However, there are still three NFL teams that don\'t have an official QB1 for the 2021 season and five others are still figuring out their QB2.           Below, we project the winners of a few quarterback battles. Projected winners for top QB battles in the NFL  #1 New England Patriots - Mac Jones, QB1 Mac Jones on a frozen rope 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rOiDECIg0t— PFF (@PFF) August 20, 2021 This is probably the most straightforward prediction after recent events.  A miscommunication led to Cam Newton violating the NFL\'s health and safety protocol and the veteran will now miss most of this week\'s practices ahead of the preseason finale.      Rookie Mac Jones will take this opportunity to solidify his case for the starting job further and win it with a good outing in the Patriots\' NFL preseason finale against the New York Giants.  #2 New Orleans Saints - Jameis Winston, QB1 SLING DAT THING @Jaboowins! 💪29-yard TD strike to @CallawayMarquez 🙌📺: ESPN pic.twitter.com/SPBZczDB1b— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) August 24, 2021 The battle between Jameis Winston and Taysom Hill has gone on longer than expected, but the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback is finally starting to pull ahead.  Winston is playing with confidence and has been efficient while leading the offense during the preseason. The former number one overall pick already had the advantage due to his history of putting up big passing numbers.      With Winston as the starter, Taysom Hill can still carve out a specialty role to get game time.  #3 San Francisco 49ers - Jimmy Garoppolo, QB1 Jimmy Garoppolo has “a pretty good idea” of who’s starting for the #49ers Week 1. This is the unbothered answer of a man who spends zero time on Twitter. pic.twitter.com/2KT366w4L5— Lydia (@limajuliettango) August 25, 2021 Trey Lance might be the better NFL quarterback prospect, but the San Francisco 49ers have over $20 million invested in Jimmy Garoppolo this year and he\'s more experienced.  That\'s not to say the 49ers can\'t make a change later in the season if they are eliminated from playoff contention, or Garoppolo struggles or gets injured. The best-case scenario is to put Lance in before the NFL trade deadline if he\'s still the better player and trade Garoppolo to a needy team.     #4 Pittsburgh Steelers - Mason Rudolph, QB2  A very underrated play of the night here from Mason Rudolph. Free rusher in his face, avoids the sack and has great awareness to try and fight to move the chains. Take your hat off and hand it to 2 here, with some help from Finney and Green. I loved this. #Steelers pic.twitter.com/3QsOiUGJ3z— Josh Carney (@ByJoshCarney) August 22, 2021 Dwayne Haskins was announced as the Steelers\' NFL preseason finale starter, meaning Mason Rudolph will be the backup to Ben Roethlisberger this year.  Haskins still has to beat Joshua Dobbs for a roster spot, which should be easy if he plays well against the Carolina Panthers\' starting defense. This year, Haskins had a solid shot at winning QB2, but Rudolph\'s strong NFL preseason performances seem to have won him the battle.     #5 Dallas Cowboys - Cooper Rush, QB2 Head coach Mike McCarthy confirmed it will be Cooper Rush taking the first-team reps at quarterback during today\'s press conference.🗣️ ""He has earned this opportunity, absolutely."" 🗣️— Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) August 23, 2021 In a surprising turn of events, Cooper Rush quietly climbed the depth chart during the NFL preseason and is in line to be the Dallas Cowboys\' backup quarterback for the 2021 season.  Garrett Gilbert entered camp as Dak Prescott\'s backup but had a disastrous outing against the Houston Texans. Rush went 25-of-38 for 256 yards and two touchdowns in preseason action. Between Rush and Gilbert, the former looked like the better NFL quarterback under pressure and proved he can lead the offense down the field. Rush was the Cowboys\' backup quarterback from 2017-2019 before Andy Dalton took over in 2020 but earned his spot back.     ']"

Chargers fans, I\'m sorry.""        Not the best apology, but an apology nonetheless. When the Chargers play the Denver Broncos, they will no doubt be hoping to already be in a Wild Card spot. Such a divisional game is always huge, but the playoff implications will only ramp up the pressure on the young quarterback. Herbert had a phenomenal game against the Dolphins as he completed 39/51 of his throws for 367 yards and a touchdown. Tua Tagovailoa, on the other hand, had one of his worst games of the season.

Herbert has been massive for the Chargers in yet another NFL season, and a postseason appearance is merely a cherry on the top. This was done in an increasingly competitive AFC Conference, where there are some Super Bowl favorites to compete against.         Justin Herbert has stood strong and led the Chargers' quest for some playoff relevance in the 2022 NFL season. It's no surprise then that he will play in tonight's game against the Denver Broncos.           Barring unforeseen circumstances, Herbert will be calling the shots against a wounded Denver Broncos led by perennial Pro Bowler Russell Wilson. Heading into the game, the Chargers are surefire favorites. They are the better team in almost every meaningful statistical category.

View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Justin Herbert's Fantasy Outlook Justin Herbert came into the league as a solid prospect with a sky-high ceiling and a not-too-low floor. He is blessed with a rocket of an arm, a fantastic football IQ, and the built-in ability to be a starter from day one. As such, it didn't come as a surprise when Herbert started all 15 games of his rookie season, scored 31 touchdowns, and was picked off only ten times. Since then, Herbert has matured even more; he now trusts his backfield more, in particular Austin Ekeler. All of this has helped the Chargers meet their preseason expectations of making the postseason, and it's up to Herbert and the guys to take them even further. Regarding tonight's game, Herbert is off the injury report against the Russell Wilson-led Denver Broncos. Herbert has shaken off a niggling shoulder injury, and he has been in every practice this week.     However, there is a chance that the Chargers will rest Herbert for most of the game to keep him fresh. They have all but secured their playoff berth.  But if seeding becomes an issue, then expect Herbert to take the bulk of the offensive snaps. Footballism@FootbaIIismNever Forget when Justin Herbert threw this ball 62 yards...

"", 'Justin Herbert laments timeout call ending Chargers\' season  Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert led a valiant effort to try and get his team back into the Week 18 AFC West matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders.   Unfortunately, it was too little, too late as the Raiders defeated the Chargers 35-32 in an overtime classic.        The outcome of Sunday night\'s game between the Los Angeles Chargers and the Las Vegas Raiders had playoff implications for three different teams.            The winner of the game also won a trip to the playoffs and would guarantee the Pittsburgh Steelers a trip to the playoffs as well.  If the Chargers and Raiders tied, then both would get into the playoffs and the Steelers would be out. With three fan bases anxiously awaiting the outcome on Sunday night, tensions were running high, even for the players involved.  Herbert also voiced his frustration as time winded down in overtime and the Raiders approached field goal range, voicing that he would welcome a tied game.

The second-year quarterback understood that with only 38 seconds left, the Chargers would clinch a playoff berth with a tie.  Staley apparently called a timeout to arrange his defense but, to no avail as the Raiders got the upper hand, and were able to run the clock down to just two seconds left.

', '“That’s like Tom Brady in his prime” – NFL analyst has hot take on Justin Herbert after Chargers’ Week 14 win vs Dolphins  Last night, Justin Herbert led the Los Angeles Chargers to victory over the Miami Dolphins, 23-17 on Sunday Night Football.  In the victory, Herbert threw for 367 passing yards while completing 39 out of 51 passes and throwing a touchdown with no turnovers. He outplayed Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who had one of the worst games of his career. Tagovailoa completed 10 out of 28 passes for 145 yards and one touchdown.                     The two quarterbacks were drafted in back-to-back picks in the 2020 NFL draft. Tua was selected fifth overall by the Dolphins, while Herbert was selected sixth overall by the Chargers. Following the win, analyst John Middleakauff praised the Chargers\' performance, comparing Herbert to Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes, and Josh Allen. Middlekauff said: ""Justin Herbert meanwhile, is 6\'5 plus, with an enormous arm, and has kept his team afloat, when his coach is the village idiot, his defense for the most part the last couple of years has been a joke, and his wide receivers have been in-and-out of lineups because they\'ve had high-ankle sprains and bad hamstrings. And his offensive line is not that great.     He added, And when you see, obviously he\'s on tonight, that\'s what Josh Allen, that\'s Patrick Mahomes, that\'s like Tom Brady in is prime, that\'s what it looks like.

Six teams will be on a bye week, the most of any week this year, and gives fantasy managers fewer options to work with.  Managers should always pay attention to specific matchups. This will be even more crucial in Week 9 when analyzing replacements and streamers. Recent performances will play a factor when deciding which quarterbacks to target, as well as the strength of their opponent's passing defense.        Week 9 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks: Start 'Em           #1 Aaron Rodgers - Green Bay Packers vs. Detroit Lions Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers Aaron Rodgers has been relatively disappointing during the 2022 NFL season. The reigning back-to-back NFL MVP winner currently ranks just 17th among quarterbacks in total Fantasy Football points this year and has also failed to finish better than QB12 in any week so far this season. He will get into an ideal situation to break out in a big way in Week 9 when the Green Bay Packers face off against the Detroit Lions. The Lions are the only team in the NFL allowing more than 30 points per game this year. They also allow the second-most fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks.     #2 Justin Fields - Chicago Bears vs. Miami Dolphins Chicago Bears QB Justin Fields Justin Fields ranks within the top 12 among quarterbacks in total Fantasy Football points this year, making him a legitimate starter in favorable matchups. He will get one in Week 9 as the Miami Dolphins are one of only seven teams allowing more than 20 fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks.         Fields has really been heating up in recent weeks due to his rushing contributions in the game. He has exceeded 45 rushing yards in each of his last six games, while also adding three rushing touchdowns. He will also get an offensive boost after the Chicago Bears acquired Chase Claypool at the NFL trade deadline. #3 Trevor Lawrence - Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Las Vegas Raiders Jacksonville Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence Trevor Lawrence has had an excellent 2022 Fantasy Football season. He finished within the top 12 in fantasy points among quarterbacks in four weeks this year, including two top-five finishes.     Lawrence has a chance to once again finish among the top quarterbacks in Week 9 against the Las Vegas Raiders. They have been the most favorable defense for quarterbacks, allowing the most fantasy points per game so far. #4 Derek Carr - Las Vegas Raiders vs, Jacksonville Jaguars Las Vegas Raiders QB Derek Carr Derek Carr has been one of the most disappointing quarterbacks during the 2022 Fantasy Football season. He entered the year with high expectations after the Las Vegas Raiders acquired Davante Adams during the offseason.     Carr finished in the top 20 in fantasy points among quarterbacks in every season of his career, while setting a new career high in total fantasy points last year. He has regressed despite adding Adams, but currently ranks as QB22 and can't be trusted in Fantasy Football regardless of match up. #5 Matthew Stafford - Los Angeles Rams vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Los Angeles Rams QB Matthew Stafford Speaking of disappointments during the 2022 Fantasy Football season, Matthew Stafford has been even more of a let down. He finished the 2021 season as a top-five quarterback, but ranks as the QB24 this year.     While Cooper Kupp continues to be one of the best wide receivers in the NFL, Stafford has severely struggled this season. A challenging matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defense is an unlikely scenario for a breakout game. #6 Jared Goff - Detroit Lions vs. Green Bay Packers Detroit Lions QB Jared Goff Jared Goff has been a popular streaming quarterback this season. He can put huge point totals in the right matchup, but has alarming bust potential in the wrong one. This was demonstrated by the top-ten finishes in the weeks he played against the Washington Commanders and Seattle Seahawks, but bottom-five finishes when facing off against the Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots.         Goff should be avoided in Fantasy Football in Week 9. The Green Bay Packers currently allow the second-fewest fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks.

With Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills up next, it doesn\'t get any easier for Mike McDaniel\'s offense.  Tagovailoa struggles in the spotlight in Chargers loss Miami Dolphins v Los Angeles Chargers As much as the game was about Herbert\'s sensational aerial show, it was also about Tua\'s poor performance.

Receiver Tyreek Hill was again the Dolphins\' main threat as he caught four passes for 81 yards and a touchdown along with a fumble return for a touchdown. Other than that it was slim pickings for Miami.

The two teams were involved in one of the most exciting finishes in the NFL this season in Week 8, with Denver making a furious comeback to narrowly edge out Los Angeles 31-30.  While the Broncos have played a few competitive games against some of the league’s best teams this season, they were crushed by the Buffalo Bills last Saturday by a final score of 48-19. Not much went right for them in that game, but prized free agent RB acquisition Melvin Gordon reached the end zone twice in that contest to make the score a little bit more respectable.

Even without a banner performance from WR Keenan Allen, who was nursing a hamstring injury, QB Justin Herbert was able to make it work with other complementary offensive players.  TE Hunter Henry scored his 4th touchdown of the season against the Raiders, and may be relied on heavily if Allen is not able to suit up for the Broncos tilt.

Broncos QB Drew Lock has shown signs of promise, and has a deep receiving corps that is developing along with the second-year passer.  WR’s Tim Patrick, Jerry Jeudy and K.J. Hamler all have the potential to explode any given week, and considering their familiarity with the Chargers, it’s a good bet that one or two of those players score this week. Herbert played well enough to win the game in Week 8, and given his steady play over most of the season, figures to excel against Denver in round two. His game-winning quarterback sneak against the Raiders was a building block for his confidence, which should extend into this game, and give Los Angeles a slight edge in this contest.Prediction: Chargers 28, Broncos 27     ', ""Lamar Jackson vs Justin Herbert: Who is the better QB right now?  Both Lamar Jackson and Justin Herbert are coming off huge games before they face each other in Week 6. As the Los Angeles Chargers take on the Baltimore Ravens, all eyes will be on their respective quarterbacks. Lamar Jackson inspired his team to a come-from-behind victory against the Indianapolis Colts the previous week. Meanwhile, Justin Herbert was not too shabby either in his demolition of the Cleveland Browns defense.

So, who is in a better form right now? Let's take a look.           Who comes into this game hotter: Lamar Jackson or Justin Herbert? Justin Herbert had an amazing game against the Cleveland Browns. He threw for 398 yards and four touchdowns against a defense that had only allowed 13 points in the last two weeks. In the Chargers' 47-42 victory, Justin Herbert seemed to have set the week's benchmark for his contemporaries. Then, in the last game of the week, Lamar Jackson blew through that. The Baltimore Ravens were down by 19 points against the Indianapolis Colts before Jackson masterminded his team's comeback. He threw for 442 yards and had four touchdowns of his own. Looking at the last game alone, it seems quite clear that Lamar Jackson is in better form than Justin Herbert. But a glance at the whole season exhibits just how good both of them have been this season.     Justin Herbert currently sits on 1,576 passing yards, good enough for fourth in the league. Lamar Jackson is close behind with 1,519 yards. It shows Lamar Jackson and Justin Herbert are roughly in the same ballpark with their passing this year. Both of them still have their differences, though. Justin Herbert is more of a classic quarterback who stands tall in the pocket and has a vicious throw. Lamar Jackson, on the other hand, is perhaps nothing like anyone has ever seen before in the NFL. He runs like a running back and throws like a quarterback.

63,Jameis Winston,"['Jameis Winston Week 8 fantasy outlook: Will the New Orleans Saints QB play this weekend?\xa0  Jameis Winston has not played for the New Orleans Saints since aggravating his back injury in Week 3 against the Carolina Panthers. However, there are signs that he should return to action sooner rather than later. In Winston\'s absence, Andy Dalton has taken up the role of the starting quarterback for the NFC South outfit.  Winston took part in full training this week with the Saints and has been declared fit to play in Week 8. But the team\'s head coach, Dennis Allen, is still not convinced with the 28-year-old returning to the fold just yet. Allen confirmed that Dalton will continue to start at quarterback for the Saints against the Las Vegas Raiders.

This is about performance           While speaking to reporters, Allen insisted that his decision to start Dalton in Week 8 was to be based on the 34-year-old\'s performance. He said: ""Andy\'s gonna get the start again this week. I feel like he\'s played well. Offensively, I feel like we\'re in a little bit of a rhythm. We\'ve been moving the ball effectively, we\'ve scored points. And so we\'re gonna continue down that road with Andy as the quarterback.""     Dalton has racked up 946 yards and seven touchdowns with four interceptions since starting for the Saints in Week 4. He threw for 361 yards, four touchdowns, and three interceptions in the Saints\' Week 7 loss to the Arizona Cardinals.     Jameis Winston\'s prospects in fantasy football When playing, Jameis Winston finds himself in an eccentric offensive system. Dennis Allen has an unorthodox way of utilizing players on both sides of the ball. This is specifically evident in his usage of tight end Taysom Hill. The tight end often substitutes as a quarterback to open up more options in terms of the running and passing game. This somewhat hinders a player like Winston\'s fantasy output.     In the three games that he started, Winston recorded 858 passing yards and four touchdowns. He holds a passer rating of 79.5 with five interceptions this campaign. However, Winston has thrown at least one touchdown in each game.The Saints quarterback has managed to score 43.92 fantasy points, averaging 14.6 points per game so far. Since Winston will not start in Week 8, steer clear from picking him as your fantasy team\'s quarterback for this weekend.Instead of Jameis Winston, here are some alternate quarterback options for Week 8:Josh AllenPatrick MahomesTom BradyLamar Jackson     ', ""How long is Jameis Winston out for?  Since 2020, Jameis Winston has been the New Orleans Saints' starting quarterback.He has had a rough time since then, being plagued with injuries. Once again, the quarterback is struggling and is questionable to play.  Winston reportedly fractured four lumbar vertebrae recently. As a result, he sat out the Saints' game against the Minnesota Vikings in Week 4. Additionally, he has mobility challenges due to foot and ankle problems. He has had to miss training in the past week and his immediate playing status is unclear. Winston needs a rest, according to head coach Dennis Allen.        It's unclear how long Winston will be sidelined, and the Saints are hopeful he didn't injure himself too badly at the start of the season.           Should you trade Jameis Winston? New Orleans Saints v Carolina Panthers Before tearing his ACL in Week 8 last season, Jameis Winston's fantasy performance was wildly uneven. He had two top-five performances but finished 16th or worse in his other four full games. While Winston will likely not produce at the same rate as in his most recent full season (2019), his aggressive style gives some optimism for fantasy football. Nevertheless, he's considered a gamble in the late rounds.     If Winston cannot regain his previous fitness level, the squad will move on to someone else and you should do the same. Jameis Winston's timeline New Orleans Saints v Carolina Panthers Winston played collegiate football for the Florida State University Seminoles, who won the title in his first season. The same year, he set a record to become the Heisman Trophy's youngest winner. It came as little surprise when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected him first overall in the 2015 NFL Draft.     Jameis Winston was good for the Buccaneers, but not consistent. He had a proclivity for interceptions that transcended acceptable limits. He is most well-known for the infamous season in which he threw 33 touchdown passes and 30 interceptions (2019). As a result, the Buccaneers let him go. Winston signed a one-year deal with the New Orleans Saints in April 2020 after his contract with Tampa Bay expired. He served as Drew Brees' backup during that time. After Brees announced his retirement following the 2020 campaign, Winston re-signed with New Orleans for another year. He faced off against Taysom Hill for the starting quarterback job. After putting on impressive displays in the preseason, he was selected as a starter for the opening game of the 2021 season. Unfortunately, he suffered a knee injury in Week 8 while playing against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, his old team. He sustained a cruciate ligament injury and missed the remainder of the campaign.He's been a bit stop and start this season. However, with four fractured vertebrae in his back that's understandable. Once he returns to full fitness, he might once more have some incredible value.

The Saints will square off against the Minnesota Vikings at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London for their Week 4 clash.

Jameis Winston injury update: Will the Saints QB play in Week 4? New Orleans Saints QB Jameis Winston     Jameis Winston will not play for the Saints against the Vikings in Week 4. The quarterback was listed as 'questionable' earlier this week, but has been downgraded to 'out' for Sunday's clash. Winston played the first three games of the season with a back injury. He has also had foot and ankle issues, causing more problems with his mobility. Saints coach Dennis Allen admitted that the accumulation of injuries built up for Winston over the start of the season. The Saints allowed Winston a rest day during Wednesday's practice session and hoped to have him back in training on Thursday. However, he didn't return to practice with the team for the rest of the week.        Although it's uncertain how long Winston will remain out, the Saints will be hoping that he hasn't done any major damage to himself at the start of the campaign. Last term, Winston tore his ACL in Week 8 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, cutting his season short.

Dalton has 35,122 passing yards in his 11-year NFL career, with a passer rating of 87.0. He can be considered a suitable replacement for Winston in your fantasy team.     "", ""How long has Jameis Winston been in the NFL?  Before earning a reputation for being the NFL's wildest gunslinger, Jameis Winston was a stellar college quarterback and put together two phenomenal years at Florida State before heading to the league.  Jameis Winston is a 27 year old Heisman winning, former #1 overall pick. He’s one of only 8 quarterbacks in NFL *history* to throw for 5,000 yards in a season. People gave up on Jameis way too early!— Emmanuel Acho (@EmmanuelAcho) August 24, 2021        During his 2013 season with FSU, Jameis Winston threw for 4,057 yards, 40 touchdowns and ten interceptions. He was the best college football player that year by quite some distance and brought home the following awards:           2013 ACC Offensive Player of the Year2013 ACC Player of the Year2013 AP Player of the Year2013 Consensus All-America Team2013 Davey O'Brien Award2013 Heisman Memorial Trophy2013 Manning Award2013 Walter Camp Player of the Year Award He also led FSU to the national championship, capping off one of the greatest seasons by a quarterback in college football history.  Winston enjoyed another dominating campaign with FSU in 2014, winning all 13 games that he started. His numbers dipped slightly from the year before, but he still managed to rack up 3,907 passing yards with 25 touchdowns and 18 interceptions.  Winston decided to forego the final two years of his eligibility and declared for the 2015 NFL draft following that season.   How many years has Jameis Winston been in the NFL?     Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers QB Jameis Winston The Tampa Bay Buccaneers drafted Jameis Winston with the number one overall pick in 2015. Winston justified the Buccaneers' decision by delivering a magnificent rookie season, amassing 4,042 yards and 22 touchdowns. Winston's performance during his rookie season landed him on the 2015 NFL All-Rookie Team and earned him a Pro Bowl selection. 💪 @Jaboowins DEEP TO @CallawayMarquez - TOUCHDOWN! 🙌#Saints pic.twitter.com/YheFLsVcRx— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) August 24, 2021     Winston followed up his rookie season with an even better campaign in 2015. He managed more passing yards and touchdowns but also amassed more turnovers, throwing 18 interceptions and fumbling ten times, of which he lost six.  His passing numbers slumped over the next two seasons, but he continued to turn the ball over at a tremendous rate. During the 2017 and 2018 seasons, Winston threw 25 interceptions and fumbled the ball 22 times, losing 10 in just 22 starts. After Jameis Winston threw 33 touchdowns and 30 interceptions in 2019, the Buccaneers and Winston parted ways. During the 2020 offseason, the New Orleans Saints signed the former Seminole as the backup for veteran quarterback Drew Brees. Winston was pegged as Brees' long-term replacement. Entering his seventh season in the NFL, Jameis Winston is now in a quarterback battle with Taysom Hill for the starting job in New Orleans. Both played their hearts out during the preseason, making the decision harder for Saints head coach Sean Payton. The former Buccaneers quarterback has made a strong case for why he should be named the starter with his performance during preseason. It's now or never for Winston. The Saints are likely to be his last shot at being a starting quarterback in the NFL. If he gets the nod in New Orleans this season, he will have to play exceptionally well to be the team's permanent starting quarterback.     "", 'Stephen A. Smith calls Rodgers\' performance ""shameful"" after Packers\' blowout loss against Saints  Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers suffered a 38-3 blowout loss against the New Orleans Saints in Week 1 of the 2021 season. No one saw this defeat coming.  Rodgers has perhaps already had his worst game of the year in Week 1. He went 15/28 for only 133 yards and two interceptions as the offense never got going.        Jameis Winston, on the other hand, was stellar, throwing for five touchdowns and 148 passing yards on the way to routing the Packers.           Stephen A. Smith tears Rodgers apart It was indeed a challenging game to watch for Packers fans and one of the team\'s most famous fans, Stephen A. Smith, gave a damning verdict on the reigning MVP\'s performance. Smith called it ""the most shameful performance of Aaron Rodgers\' career"" and even went as far as saying the quarterback didn\'t care about the game or the outcome. Smith did not stop there. He added that the performance was ""atrocious"" and ""embarrassing"" for Rodgers. ""That was the most atrocious performance of [Aaron Rodgers\'] career. He was so awful that embarrassing doesn\'t even begin to describe it.""@stephenasmith calls Sunday\'s game against the Saints the ""most shameful performance of Aaron Rodgers\' career."" 😶 pic.twitter.com/J72NWKlhI8— First Take (@FirstTake) September 13, 2021     Smith not only ripped into Rodgers but also went after head coach Matt LaFleur. Smith said that LeFluer did not have the team prepared adequately, and given it was the opening game of the year, that should not be happening. Even though the Packers are still well and truly in the running to win the division, this type of loss could have long-lasting effects on the team. Rodgers played so poorly on Sunday that the much-maligned Jordan Love was given snaps after the former MVP was benched. Now, this is more likely to do with the fact that the scoreline was already out of hand, and the Packers didn\'t have much to lose. Then there are the Saints. Clearly, without Drew Brees, they will not be the offensive powerhouse they have been in the past few years, but they can still pack a punch with wideout Michael Thomas. Jameis Winston looked as good as ever, but most are still unsure exactly where the Saints sit in the NFC race, unlike the Packers, who many believe will be there come the postseason. However, after a result like this, questions have to be asked, and the fact that a performance like this happened in Week 1 is troubling.     Despite the poor outing, it is only one game, and the Packers will look to get back on the winners\' list next week when they face the Detroit Lions.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 2 TV Schedule     ', ""3 things to expect from New Orleans Saints QB Jameis Winston in Week 1  Jameis Winston has been officially named the Week 1 starter for the New Orleans Saints. Although Taysom Hill showed elements of brilliance in the preseason, Winston's stellar performance against the Jaguars in the second game has earned him the starting quarterback spot in New Orleans.  💪 @Jaboowins DEEP TO @CallawayMarquez - TOUCHDOWN! 🙌#Saints pic.twitter.com/YheFLsVcRx— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) August 24, 2021        With all of the Michael Thomas drama unfolding during the offseason and his return from injury still in question, another deep threat has emerged for Winston: Marquez Callaway. The pair connected for two TDs in the New Orleans Saints' victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars.           Heading into Week 1, here are three things to expect from Jameis Winston.  #1 Keep this high-powered offense going Jameis Winston is fortunate to take over an offense that continually puts up good numbers. The Saints retained most of their players in the offseason, so there is no reason they should fall out of the top ten when it comes to producing yardage and TDs. With Alvin Kamara, Michael Thomas and Marquez Callaway waiting in the wings to catch passes, Winston should have no issues marching his team down the field against the Packers. #2 Find a way to beat Aaron Rodgers There has been plenty of drama surrounding Aaron Rodgers and the Packers. The disgruntled quarterback is planning an exit next season and could be playing with a chip on his shoulder.     Jameis Winston will have to outduel Rodgers, who has some powerful weapons of his own. Breakout stars Davante Adams, Aaron Jones and Randall Cobb, who's returned at the behest of Rodgers, could spell trouble for Winston's potential win. If Winston can match yardage with Rodgers, the Saints could start the season strong. #3 Start the season with a win Week 1 tends to be a toss up for most teams. With new players across the board, a new playbook, and a host of other variables, there is no telling who might come away with a victory. The New Orleans Saints find themselves in a tough position playing against the Green Bay Packers. Aaron Rodgers and the Packers travel to take on the Saints in what could be a future playoff game. However, Jameis Winston coming away with a victory will seal his status as the right choice as the Saints' starting quarterback. With Jameis Winston starting, where does Taysom Hill fit in?     Taysom Hill is still a viable starting quarterback, so there's a chance some quarterback-needy teams could come calling to steal the multi-talented threat away from the Saints. The Saints would do well to keep the gunslinger happy and wanting to play backup to Winston. Through the first 2 preseason games, @CallawayMarquez:8 recs for 165 yds (20.6 avg.) and 2 TDs 🙌A look at all of his catches 👀 🔄: @NFL | More on https://t.co/KlYFEtTVGFpic.twitter.com/rzcQxVP0V8— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) August 25, 2021Hill drops dimes to Callaway. As much success as Marquez Callaway is having with Winston, Hill has had the same success. The Saints could keep Hill as a goalline threat. Even using Hill in WR and TE situations would help the Saints offense be even more dangerous and keep defenses guessing.     "", ""Will Mac Jones or James Winston have a better game in Week 3  The rivalry between the New England Patriots and New Orleans Saints will enter a new chapter in Week 3. Mac Jones and Jameis Winston are respectively taking over for Tom Brady and Drew Brees. It will be the first time the Patriots and Saints have faced off since 2017.  Mac Jones and Winston have had ups and downs this season. Jones is making his third career start and has been incredibly accurate with his passes thus far. Winston had a Week 1 performance that included five touchdowns but played poorly in Week 2.        The question is, which quarterback will lead their team to a better game on Sunday?           Will Mac Jones or Jameis Winston have a better game in Week 3? Making the case for Mac Jones Doug Kyed@DougKyedMac Jones through two weeks:🔹84.1% adjusted completion percentage (1st)🔹6.8% big-time throw percentage (7th)🔹84.3 @PFF clean pocket grade (9th)🔹2.55s average time to throw (9th)🔹63.2% accurate percentage (9th)🔹70.2 overall passing grade (16th)🔹6.2 ADOT (28th)9:58 AM · Sep 21, 202144260Mac Jones through two weeks:🔹84.1% adjusted completion percentage (1st)🔹6.8% big-time throw percentage (7th)🔹84.3 @PFF clean pocket grade (9th)🔹2.55s average time to throw (9th)🔹63.2% accurate percentage (9th)🔹70.2 overall passing grade (16th)🔹6.2 ADOT (28th) The argument in favor of Mac Jones stems from a lack of mistakes. Jones has completed 73.9 percent of his passes through two games. He takes check-downs more often than not, but with a rejuvenated James White in the backfield, it's worked well.     Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels has called conservative games for Jones. Jones gets the ball out incredibly quickly, but not for a lot of yards. According to NextGen Stats, Jones has the sixth-lowest average completed air yards in the NFL with 4.4 yards. It's not a bad idea to take it slow with a rookie QB. But at some point, they're going to have to let him take some risks. Another thing the Patriots should let Mac Jones do is RPOs. The Patriots' wide receivers leave big plays to be desired. Why not use RPOs to scheme up more yards? Ultimately, it's hard to nitpick too much at Mac Jones. He's been clean and efficient in the pocket and holds his own against the blitz. There's little reason to think he won't have a good game on Sunday with the style of play he's running. Making the case for Winston Mike Kennedy@MikeKennedyNFLTurnover-worthy play percentage “leaders” through Week 2 (PFF):1) Justin Fields, 9.1%2) Ben Roethlisberger, 6.3%3) Trevor Lawrence, 6.2%4) Jameis Winston, 5.7%5) Zach Wilson, 5.6%10:56 AM · Sep 21, 20211Turnover-worthy play percentage “leaders” through Week 2 (PFF):1) Justin Fields, 9.1%2) Ben Roethlisberger, 6.3%3) Trevor Lawrence, 6.2%4) Jameis Winston, 5.7%5) Zach Wilson, 5.6% https://t.co/hjOuetTgvu     Winston couldn't be more the opposite of a player than Mac Jones. While Jones is conservative, Winston's always been a risk taker. But in 2021, Winston toned down his yards per attempt to a career-low 6.2. His wide receivers leave a lot to be desired. But the offense is schemed to run through Alvin Kamara rather than putting the load on Winston. In Week 1, Winston completed 14 of 20 throws for 148 yards and five touchdowns. Winston didn't force things and had a game that forced NFL fans to take a double-take. But in Week 2, Winston looked like the turnover and mistake-prone QB he's always been. He threw two interceptions and was sacked four times. Bill Belichick is a genius at cooking up defenses to throw quarterbacks off their game. Winston benefits from having the best-skilled position player on either team in Kamara. But the tough question is which version of Winston will show up in New England?     Mac Jones will have the better Week 3 game Mac Jones will have a better game in Week 3 than Winston. Jones may not be a risk-taker yet, but the Patriots don't need him to be. Winston will have help from Kamara in the passing game, but without Michael Thomas, that's where his help stops.The Saints' offensive line struggled in Week 2, and if they struggle again, that's a concern going forward.     "", ""5 NFL Players that surprised the most on Sunday - September 12th, 2021  NFL Sundays are back! Fans were treated to some incredible games and performances on the first Sunday of the new NFL season.  While the usual suspects like Patrick Mahomes and DeAndre Hopkins performed just about as well as they were expected to, there were a few players who exceeded fans' expectations and delivered masterful performances on Sunday.        Players that surprised the most on Sunday           #1 - Jameis Winston, QB, New Orleans Saints Maybe, just maybe, this was the most exciting game before the first snap. Everyone wanted to see how the New Orleans Saints would play after Drew Brees' retirement, but no one could have anticipated what happened in Louisiana for a couple of reasons. First, who could have imagined Aaron Rodgers playing so badly? Second, who could have imagined Jameis Winston playing so well? The former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback threw for five touchdowns while tallying less than 150 passing yards. It will be tough for any quarterback to surpass the craziness that was Winston's performance. A performance for the ages. #2 - Brandin Cooks, WR, Houston Texans Everyone is aware that Brandin Cooks is a player capable of producing incredible performances. The wide receiver can put up big numbers on any given Sunday.     But doing so for a team that has had such a turbulent offseason, with Tyrod Taylor under center and with a team that possibly has the worst roster in the NFL, is extremely surprising. Cooks racked up 132 receiving yards in just five catches as the Texans humbled the Jacksonville Jaguars 37-21. The wide receiver is probably the best player on the Texans' roster outside of Deshaun Watson and he did not disappoint in his team's season-opener.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Brandin Cooks (@thearcher)     #3 - Eli Mitchell, RB, San Francisco 49ers Who? Exactly! The sixth-round pick out of Louisiana is a player that no one knew, no one expected anything from. But Eli Mitchell ran for 104 yards and a touchdown on his NFL debut in a historic performance. Eli Mitchell (23 years, 133 days) is the 2nd #FTTB player since 1950 to rush for 100+ yards in his NFL debut. Mitchell rushed for 104 yards and had a TD today. The other: Ricky Watters (23-152) on Sept. 6, 1992 at Giants (100 rush yds, no TD). #SFvsDET— Darin Stephens (@SharksStats) September 12, 2021 Mitchell's incredible performance helped the San Franciso 49ers beat the Detroit Lions 41-33. #4 - Chandler Jones, LB, Arizona Cardinals Chandler Jones had five sacks on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans. Yes, that's right, five.     He tied the Cardinals' record, set last season by Hasson Reddick against the New York Giants, two shy of tying the record of seven set by former Kansas City Chiefs Derrick Thomas. Jones' performance on Sunday was so good that even LeBron James gave him a shoutout on Twitter. I’ll say it again. CHANDLER JONES is going for DPOY!!!! My GOODNESS— LeBron James (@KingJames) September 12, 2021 #5 David Njoku, TE, Cleveland BrownsOn Sunday, David Njoku caught just three passes against the Kansas City Chiefs, but managed to rack up 76 receiving yards in the Browns' loss at Arrowhead Stadium.Njoku hauled in big catches when the Browns needed them and was a big factor as a blocker as well. It was an excellent performance from the young tight end.     "", 'When will Michael Thomas return?

It had caused problems with the Saints.  Thomas has not featured in the Saints’ preseason campaign as he continues his rehabilitation from ankle surgery. The star wide receiver is expected to return to the field in early-to-mid October. He could be active in the Saints’ Week 5 clash against the Washington Football Team.

What happened between Michael Thomas and the Saints? New Orleans Saints WR Michael Thomas isn\'t expected back until October There was a brief moment this offseason when the Saints fan base thought Michael Thomas could be on the move. It seems as if things have calmed down in New Orleans since, but there\'s still some tension over the way Thomas handled his injury.     New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton spoke to reporters during training camp about Michael Thomas\' injury. Payton expressed how he felt about Michael Thomas\' absence. ""It\'s disappointing. We would have liked it to have happened earlier rather than later. And quite honestly, it should have."" That brought a reaction from Michael Thomas. The Saints wideout posted a cryptic message on his Twitter account: ""They tried to damage your reputation. You saved theirs by not telling your side of the story.""A couple of days after posting that, Michael Thomas mentioned that he was threatening the Saints.

64,Jimmy Garoppolo,"['“Jimmy Garoppolo is a top tier scammer” – NFL fans tear into 49ers QB as Broncos limp to 11-10 win on Sunday Night Football  A wild day in the NFL came to a tame finish, as the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers served up a slow, sluggish, low-scoring affair on Sunday Night Football.  Both offenses struggled to move the ball as the game boiled down to a punting contest, much to the dismay of the Denver faithful, who even booed their team. But late in the fourth quarter, Russell Wilson conjured a touchdown drive, and the Broncos defense forced two turnovers to help the home side beat the 49ers 11-10.        Both Wilson and his opposing quarterback, Jimmy Garoppolo, were heavily criticized on social media for their lackluster performances. The 49ers star, in particular, was incessantly lambasted by fans.            Garoppolo is notably starting games for San Francisco only because Trey Lance suffered a season-ending injury in Week 2. He completed 18 of his 29 pass attempts for 211 yards, one touchdown, and one costly interception against the Broncos. But the most perplexing moment in Garoppolo\'s underwhelming performance was the two points he gave up after stepping out of bounds while in the end zone.

They will face the reigning Super Bowl champions, the Los Angeles Rams, twice and host the Kansas City Chiefs at Levi\'s Stadium in three of their next five games. Los Angeles and Patrick Mahomes\' Kansas City side are both 2-1 this season. Their other two games against the Carolina Panthers and Atlanta Falcons may look easy on paper. But given their struggles on offense, it could prove to be an arduous month for San Francisco, who are 1-2 so far this season.Head coach Kyle Shanahan has plenty to ponder upon before his team\'s Monday Night Football clash against the Rams next week. Armed with a quarterback he was desperate to discard in Garoppolo, Shanahan has to find a way to make things work before the season spirals into doom.     ', ""Has Jimmy Garoppolo secured his place as the 49ers starting QB after Week 3 performance?  Jimmy Garoppolo has been under plenty of scrutiny throughout his career. Many wonder if he is, in fact, the long-term answer for the San Francisco 49ers.  Those thoughts were exaggerated even more when the 49ers drafted Trey Lance in the 2020 NFL Draft. Lance went on to turn heads throughout the preseason and is often being showcased as a much better prospect than other rookie quarterbacks.        After the 49ers played an intense game, losing to the Green Bay Packers in the final seconds of Sunday night's game, the question remains: is Jimmy Garoppolo the answer at quarterback?           Is Trey Lance a better option than Jimmy Garoppolo? Jimmy Garoppolo hasn't exactly played badly in the first three weeks of NFL action, but the idea now is should he remain the starter? The 49ers could very well go the route that the Miami Dolphins took in 2020 when Ryan Fitzpatrick was benched in favor of rookie Tua Tagovailoa. Tua went on to have a 6-3 record last season under center. Trey Lance may have more upside than Tua. The only way to truly find out would be to bench Garoppolo. The standing rumors are that the 49ers may make that change somewhere in Week 6 or 7 of this season. The 49ers are currently 2-1 and in third place in the NFC West.

Jimmy Garoppolo 88.5%*min 45 attempts https://t.co/xyAj0XVnt2 Jimmy Garoppolo's stats are decent enough to lend to the idea that he should remain the starter. Garoppolo currently has 257 yards with 2 TDs and 1 INT. His 64 attempts on 95 attempts give a 67.4% completion percentage. He also has a 101.2 passer rating with these numbers. Garoppolo's numbers in completion percentage, total yards, and passer rating have him hovering around the middle mark for all active quarterbacks. That could be the reasoning behind the rumors surrounding Trey Lance starting at some point this season.     The issue with Garoppolo is his need or want to throw the ball downfield more than he currently has. Garoppolo's longest pass is for 79 yards, which is quite good. However, his 8 yards per attempt is his total average. It's a stat that most quarterbacks will want to improve upon. Garoppolo needs to have more confidence in throwing the long ball, or he might not be able to. His mobility could still be in question after a lackluster 2020 campaign due to lingering injuries.

"", ""Steelers could land themselves a Ben Roethlisberger replacement in Jimmy Garoppolo  The Pittsburgh Steelers suddenly need a new quarterback now that Ben Roethlisberger is officially set to retire. The in-house options of Mason Rudolph and Dwayne Haskins don't excite fans, and may even have some worried that those two will compete for the starting job.  Both should be in a competition in general. However, a consistent winner like the Steelers seem poised to go out and acquire a proven talent. Remember, the team has never had a losing season under Mike Tomlin. Why start in 2022?        Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson are the home run options for Pittsburgh. The problem is that neither is confirmed to be ready to force a trade out of their respective cities. And even if they do, Pittsburgh isn't automatically a top choice.           This puts the name of Jimmy Garoppolo into the mix as a realistic option. We know he is on his way out of San Francisco because the team drafted Trey Lance with the No. 3 overall pick last year. Garoppolo also failed to do enough to lead the 49ers to victory in the NFC Championship Game. A late interception to seal the game also sealed his fate out in the Bay Area.

So how can the Steelers go about adding Garoppolo to their roster? The Steelers have a safe and realistic option at QB in Jimmy Garoppolo NFC Wild Card Playoffs - San Francisco 49ers v Dallas Cowboys The 49ers quarterback is under contract for one more season and carries a salary of $25.5 million. His dead cap is only $1.4 million, so a trade before June 1 is inevitable. The Steelers would also be doing the 49ers a favor here, so it's not like any top picks have to head to them in return. The fact he only has one year remaining lowers his value as well.     Let's say Garoppolo lands in Pittsburgh. He is coming off a season in which he threw for 3,810 yards and 20 touchdowns in 15 games. Those are not mind-blowing numbers, but he has had proven success when healthy. He has only been a full-time starter in 2019 and 2021, and the 49ers went deep into the postseason both times. There is a criticism out there that he was propped up by the team's running game. Well, if he goes to Pittsburgh, fans can still expect Najee Harris to have a huge role in the offense. He himself propped up Roethlisberger this past year, so this isn't some new formula.

Trying to land players like Rodgers or Wilson involves lucrative trade packages and convincing as well. Landing Garoppolo is much more straightforward, and something like a second-round pick could even be considered an overpay.The Steelers did not establish a proper succession plan for Roethlisberger.

At first glance, it would. Like the 49ers, the Colts are a run-first football team led by Jonathan Taylor, who finished last season with 1,811 rushing yards and a whopping 18 touchdowns. Much of the Colts\' game plan will rely on Garoppolo simply handing the ball off to Taylor and letting him do the work. We have seen Garoppolo in a similar system with the 49ers with the carousel of running backs Kyle Shanahan used.     The Colts, like Denver, who have acquired Russell Wilson (in principle), are right in the Super Bowl sweet spot. A superb defense last season led by Darius Leonard, Kenny Moore, DeForest Buckner, Xavier Rhodes, and Isaiah Rodgers. Offensively, much goes through Taylor, but there are some weapons on the outside in Michael Pittman Jr., Zach Pascal, and tight end Mo Alie-Cox. Garoppolo could make the situation in Indy work well.

If you are choosing between Jimmy Garoppolo and Andy Dalton for your fantasy team, there is a lot to consider. In fantasy, who can score you the most points this week is the most important thing, but you must also consider who is a reliable long-term option.  On the surface, there isn't a huge difference between Dalton and Garoppolo, but there's a lot behind the scenes that should determine your choice. Both these quarterbacks started the 2022 season as backups and both are set to start in Week 8. So who should you start in Week 8 and who should you hitch your wagon to for the rest of the season?        We recommend that you start Jimmy Garoppolo rather than Andy Dalton for Week 8 and for the remainder of the campaign.           Why Jimmy Garoppolo is a better fantasy pick than Andy Dalton Kansas City Chiefs v San Francisco 49ers The crux of the matter is that Garoppolo is going to be the starter for the rest of the 2022 season, whereas Dalton looks to be on borrowed time. For Week 8, Garoppolo and the San Francisco 49ers play the Los Angeles Rams. It's a huge game by all accounts, and yes, the Rams defense is scary. Dalton and the New Orleans Saints play the Las Vegas Raiders.     On the surface, this looks like an Andy Dalton week. However, the Saints QB threw three interceptions last week against the Arizona Cardinals (including two pick-sixes) and there are some concerns regarding his ball security. Yes, Garoppolo threw an interception against the Kansas City Chiefs, but he is more composed than Dalton at present. Dalton is starting for New Orleans, but he is unlikely to be their starter for the rest of the season. Jameis Winston is just about healthy and though the Saints are rolling with Dalton, he has to perform to remain the starter and is therefore under pressure. Garoppolo's consistency under center for the 49ers and the offensive weapons at his disposal should give you confidence in starting him. He throws the ball to names like Deebo Samuels and now has Christian McCaffrey, while the Saints are riddled with injuries and question marks. Garoppolo is playing for a Super Bowl contender in San Francisco, so you can be sure he's going to put up numbers as long as he's fit. Dalton, on the other hand, is playing for a struggling team. New Orleans are unlikely to make the playoffs this season and relying on their offense is a risky bet.     Andy Dalton and Jimmy Garoppolo's performances in recent seasons New Orleans Saints v Arizona Cardinals Andy Dalton has been around the league for quite some time, and he has the accolades to prove it. Don't let recency bias fool you, there was a time when he was one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. However, he hasn't been the same since the Bengals released him in 2020 following four losing seasons. Dalton acted as Dak Prescott's backup for the Dallas Cowboys for the 2020 season. He alternated as a starter and backup for the Chicago Bears last campaign, before signing with the New Orleans Saints for the 2022 season. Last season, he passed for 1,512 yards, eight touchdowns, and nine interceptions across eight games.     Jimmy Garoppolo gets so much unfair criticism that it occasionally feels ludicrous. He started his career as Tom Brady's backup on the all-conquering New England Patriots. He was in New England from 2014 until he was traded to the 49ers in 2017. He has remained there since, leading the franchise to numerous winning records and a Super Bowl appearance in 2019. He took the 49ers to the NFC Championship Game in 2021 and was close to leading the franchise to another Super Bowl appearance. Alas, he fell short and the Rams went on to win it all. Last season, Garoppolo passed for 3,810 yards, 27 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions across 15 games. How have Andy Dalton and Jimmy Garoppolo performed this season? Seattle Seahawks v San Francisco 49ersAndy Dalton has performed admirably in New Orleans this season. He has passed for 946 yards, seven touchdowns, and four interceptions in four games. Jimmy Garoppolo came in to steady the ship in San Francisco following an injury to second-year quarterback Trey Lance. Garoppolo has passed for 1,456 yards, nine touchdowns, and four interceptions in six games.     "", ""Jimmy Garoppolo vs Trey Lance: Who will be the San Francisco 49ers' starter?  In one of the most interesting quarterback battles entering the 2021 season, the battle between rookie Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo has no end in sight. Who has the right to be the starter?  The most convenient answer to this question is Jimmy Garoppolo. The veteran has cemented himself as the starter for the 49ers'. The emerging rookie has, however, shown some brilliance in his command of the offense in pre-season.        110 total yards + 2 passing TDs.Another impressive #NFLPreseason performance from @treylance09 pic.twitter.com/7IYpdq4Wsp— NFL (@NFL) August 24, 2021           The rookie quarterback seems to be finding his footing within the dynamic 49ers offense. The highlights that Trey Lance can produce are a welcome sight that any team would cherish. Trey Lance threw for 128 yards and one touchdown in Week 1 of the preseason. Lance completed five of 14 passes, which doesn't look impressive, but a misleading number, in that the 49ers currently own the most dropped passes in the preseason: seven. Trey Lance had a much better showing in Week 2 of action, completing 8-14 passes, totalling 102 yards, two TDs and one INT.     Will Jimmy Garoppolo's injury concerns allow for Trey Lance to take the reins? There has been a lot riding on Jimmy Garoppolo, especially with durability concerns. Back in 2018, Jimmy Garoppolo's season was cut short from an ACL tear, and most assumed the quarterback would never truly return to his true form. The injury came at the worst time of the season when the hype around Jimmy Garoppolo was at its peak. In the 2020 season, Garoppolo suffered a high ankle sprain in Week 2 that seemed to nag at the quarterback. Garoppolo returned in Weeks 5 through 8, but the flare-up of the ankle injury was evident. Garoppolo's passes missed their zip. He isn't the typical field stretch quarterback, so quick and shorter passes are needed, but, the ankle injury kept this from happening. On November 1 last year, the injury returned against the Seahawks.     Garoppolo was removed from the game, ending his season and resulting in only six games played for the veteran.

With that veteran presence comes the ability to make plays like the one above. Jimmy Garoppolo stepped up into the pocket, avoiding two tackles while gaining some good yardage. His former injury concerns should be laid to rest from the video. No one coming off a major injury would be able to move in that manner. Garoppolo looks quick. His leg movement and lightning-quick passes should help to move the chains with ease.     Garoppolo is still a proven veteran, having thrown for 1,096 yards, seven TDs and five INTs. He still boasted a 92.4 QBR in his limited games. This is still Jimmy Garoppolo's team to command.If there is another setback with Garoppolo's ankle, or any other manner of injury causing the veteran to ride the bench, then Trey Lance will be the next obvious choice. But for now, Trey Lance must wait his turn.

His performance on the night led fans and analysts into believing that he is the right man for the job instead of Lance.

While the franchise made it all the way to the NFC title game last season, beating the Dallas Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers, there\'s still talk of starting quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo being traded.  This is due to the fact that the franchise traded up to draft quarterback Trey Lance of NDSU with the third overall pick in 2021.

Jimmy Garoppolo\'s 49ers future hangs in the balance Jimmy Garoppolo himself has had his fair share of issues over the years. Like Lance, Jimmy G too was set to take over from a far more experienced quarterback. Unfortuanetly for him, that quarterback was then Patriots QB1 Tom Brady.

Perhaps, the Titans had a chance. That would quickly end as Tom Brady threw two touchdown passes to wide receiver Randy Moss within a minute. Titans quarterback Vince Young threw an interception shortly afterward which, of course, resulted in yet another Patriots touchdown.           Tom Brady threw touchdown passes within the two-minute warning to wide receiver Wes Welker to make it 45-0 at halftime.

Backup quarterback Brian Hoyer would finally sub in for Brady and grab the final touchdown of the day as NFL history was made at the expense of the Tennesse Titans. Tom Brady would finish 29/34, 380 yards, and six touchdown passes, somehow not enough for a perfect passer rating. Welker would finish with 150 yards and two touchdowns, while Moss would have to settle for 129 yards and three TDs.

Tom Brady owns every quarterback stat ever Super Bowl LV No team in NFL history has ever won seven Super Bowls; however, a player has, and that man is Tom Brady. Brady would win six rings alongside Belichick, and the quarterback would prove he did not need Belichick when he brought a Super Bowl win home to Tampa. He has five Super Bowl MVPs and three regular-season MVPs.     Brady has the most passing yards (89,214) and the most touchdown passes ever (649), His records are secure for years to come. Patrick Mahomes is having an amazing NFL career so far, but he would probably have to play into his mid-40s to trouble Brady\'s records.Tom Brady is the NFL\'s undisputed GOAT.     ', ""NFL week 4 best rookie performances  With Week 4 of the 2022 NFL season almost in the books, plenty of rookies from the 2022 NFL Draft class have started breaking out. They may have taken a few weeks to get acclimated to the league, and their team may not have had the confidence to start them right away.  Now that the season is well underway, we're seeing more and more newcomers make an impact in the league every week.         Here are the five best rookie performances from Week 4 of the 2022 NFL season           #5 - Kenny Pickett New York Jets v Pittsburgh Steelers The Pittsburgh Steelers finally gave rookie quarterback Kenny Pickett his shot during their Week 4 loss to the New York Jets. Despite throwing three interceptions, Pickett also ran in two touchdowns as Pittsburgh fell to a narrow defeat. He only played one half but expect Pickett to start ahead of Mitch Trubisky going forward.     #4 - Bailey Zappe New England Patriots v Green Bay Packers Another rookie quarterback who got a chance in Week 4 was Bailey Zappe of the New England Patriots. After the Patriots lost Mac Jones, then Brian Hoyer to injury just 10 minutes into their clash against the Green Bay Packers, not many fans must have had hopes of a victory. However, Zappe was excellent in a hostile atmosphere, passing for a touchdown and 99 yards with a QBR of 107.4. Despite the Patriots losing in overtime to Aaron Rodgers and the Packers, Zappe became the first rookie quarterback to pass for a touchdown in 2022.

Gardner has already established himself as a true shutdown corner. He allowed just two catches on seven targets in this game. Gardner also allowed just nine yards on those two receptions, and it seems as though the Jets have a true franchise cornerback on their hands. #2 - George Pickens Pittsburgh Steelers v Cleveland Browns Another standout rookie from the Jets and Steelers game was wide receiver George Pickens.     He truly broke out in Week 4, going for 102 yards on six receptions during Pittsburgh's loss to New York. Mike Tomlin will be hoping the rookie pairing of Pickens and Kenny Pickett will help lead the team to glory in the years to come. #1 - Dameon Pierce Los Angeles Chargers v Houston Texans Houston Texans running back Dameon Pierce has solidified himself as the starting back for the team already in his first season, and his Week 4 performance was his best yet.

Backup quarterback Brian Hoyer suffered a head injury that knocked him out of the game.  In the first quarter, the Patriots were leading 3-0 when they faced a 3rd-and-10 from the Packers' 36-yard line. Hoyer dropped back to pass but was instead sacked by Rashan Gray, ending the Patriots' drive around midfield. The quarterback hit the ground head first and went into the blue medical tent to get checked out before going back to the locker room for more tests.

Who is Bailey Zappe? The New England Patriots selected quarterback Bailey Zappe with the 137th overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft. The rookie was a star in his final season at Western Kentucky. He broke the FBS record for most passing yards (5,902) and passing touchdowns (61) in a single season. They were previously held by B.J. Symons (5,833 yards) and Joe Burrow (61 touchdown passes), respectively.     Barstool Sportsbook@BSSportsbookIt’s Bailey Zappe season38928It’s Bailey Zappe season https://t.co/azRYsJ6hYQ Zappe had a decent first half in his NFL debut. He completed six of his ten pass attempts for 31 yards and was leading the Patriots down the field in the final minute of the half. But a strip sack by Rashan Gray ended the drive and gave Aaron Rodgers the opportunity to add to the Packers' lead.

In Week 2 of the 2001 NFL season, Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe suffered a serious injury against the New York Jets, forcing the team to turn to quarterback Tom Brady, who cemented his place as the starter with solid performances and went on to win seven rings and become the greatest player in NFL history.     Dylan@Pats_expressMac Jones and Bailey Zappe678Mac Jones and Bailey Zappe https://t.co/nsY0gtp3rpIt's too early to draw comparisons between Zappe and Brady, and the rookie will only be focusing on winning the game against the Packers.     "", ""Mac Jones carried off field by Patriots teammates after horrible performance against Ravens  Mac Jones and the New England Patriots had a night to forget as they lost 26 - 37 to the Baltimore Ravens at home. It was an ordeal for Mac Jones as he completed 22 of 32 passes for 321 yards but threw three interceptions. His night only got worse as, with a couple of minutes left to play, he suffered a leg injury.            Further tests are required to understand the exact nature of the injury, but there appear to be fears that it could be tendon or ligament damage. That did not show up on the preliminary X-Ray done today, but more details are expected after further medical testing on Monday.           Teammates give Mac Jones a shoulder Baltimore Ravens v New England Patriots Mac Jones could be seen in terrible discomfort after the game, and pictures appeared to show him leaning on his teammates as he was carried to the locker room.

It was a pass which, to compound his misery, was picked off. One could see him trying to avoid putting any weight on the injured leg as he made it to the sidelines. Beyond the Monster@BeyondtheMnstrMac Jones hobbling off the field. #Patriots • #ForeverNE 5Mac Jones hobbling off the field. #Patriots • #ForeverNE https://t.co/mcYjzMrJCs     Mac Jones has an excellent injury record and durability, but there will be concerns that he has previously been injured in college while playing for the University of Alabama and in the Senior Bowl. He initially suffered a bone bruise in 2021 while in Alabama, but it did not lead to any missed snaps. In the second case, he injured both ankles and was forced to miss the game altogether. Last year, he did not have any injury problems behind a steady offensive line and started all 17 regular season games. The extent of the injury, as highlighted before, is not known, but there is a good chance that he may miss 2-4 weeks, including the New England Patriots' next game against the Green Bay Packers. In such circumstances, they would have to rely on either Brian Hoyer or rookie Bailey Zappe.    Losing Mac Jones would be a huge blow to Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots. Even though it is early in the season, they have begun it 1-2 after their latest loss and sit fourth in the AFC East. The offense was already stuttering as they scored only 17 points in their solitary win against the equally uninspiring Pittsburgh Steelers, but if Jones were to miss a major chunk of the season, it would only go uphill from here.     "", ""5 things to watch for in Cam Netwon & Mac Jones QB battle in first NFL preseason game  The New England Patriots will play their first preseason game against the Washington Football Team tonight and fans will get a first look at Mac Jones at quarterback.  Jones is expected to take over the starting job from Cam Newton at some point this year, but it's still unclear when. The only thing that is clear for now is that Newton will start the game and Jones will lead the second unit later.        The quarterback battle in New England has been a hot topic since the draft and we will get more answers after tonight's match against Washington.           What to watch out for in the Cam Newton vs. Mac Jones battle during NFL preseason Week 1 #1 - When will Mac Jones take the field? Mac Jones was the last player off the field. Spent extra time talking with Bill Belichick and Josh McDaniels. pic.twitter.com/YFRLr4rL3F— Zack Cox (@ZackCoxNESN) August 6, 2021 Starting quarterbacks don't usually play more than two or three drives in their first NFL preseason game, but that is only if they are the incumbent starter.     Cam Newton will likely play the entire first quarter. The point when Mac Jones enters the game will provide us with a clue about his development. If it's in the first quarter and he plays more than Newton, the veteran will seemingly have the lead in their competition. If it's not until the second quarter or second half and Mac Jones plays a similar amount, then neither has the advantage yet. #2 - More pass plays or run plays This is the second straight practice @BournePoly11 has caught all 4 targets in team drills.Here he is working a nice release and mid-route adjustment on a pass from Mac Jones. pic.twitter.com/XAEvDPl6Bw— Andrew Callahan (@_AndrewCallahan) August 9, 2021     Look out for how many run plays the Patriots call during the game. If the team calls more runs than passes when Newton and Jones are on the field, that could indicate that the coaches don't have much faith in their quarterbacks yet. Also, keep an eye on which quarterback attempts more passes. #3 - Does Brian Hoyer factor into the game? Brian Hoyer The focus will be on Cam Newton and Mac Jones, but what about the other quarterbacks on the depth chart? Jarrett Stidham is out injured and Brian Hoyer is the only other quarterback that will suit up for tonight's game.     Will he even get on the field for Week 1? It seems likely that Mac Jones and Cam Newton will play a quarter each and Hoyer will get his reps in the second half. In Week 2, we will likely see Newton and Jones play a half each. #4 - Overall performance of each QB Cam Newton has been SLINGING it at Pats camp 🎯QB1? (via @Patsperfect_) pic.twitter.com/a3sh2tcdz1— B/R Gridiron (@brgridiron) August 10, 2021 Fans, coaches and the media will analyze every play that Newton and Jones are on the field for. Does Cam Newton still rely on his instincts to run, or does he plant his feet and make a play through the air? Can Mac Jones transfer his accuracy in training camp to a game?     Bill Belichick and his coaching staff will be dissecting each play to see if Newton is a better passer than in 2020 and if Jones can keep up with the NFL defenses. #5 - Will the second-string WRs kill Mac Jones' momentum? Mac Jones throws to #Patriots receivers, including Gunner Olszewski, during practice inside Gillette Stadium Tuesday. @ABC6 pic.twitter.com/PHbJew4Lr2— Nick Coit (@NCoitABC6) August 10, 2021 Cam Newton will play with the Patriots' first-team offense that features the likes of Jakobi Meyers, Kendrick Bourne and Jonnu Smith.Mac Jones should have James White to throw to, but beyond that, it will be special teamers like Matthew Slater and Gunner Olszewski. Jones won't have the team's top playmakers on the field, but he will have to make it work.Also Read: Who is Cam Newton's girlfriend, La Reina Shaw?

New England fans got their first look at the Patriots rookie quarterback Mac Jones. Cam Newton and Brian Hoyer also saw action against Washington.  The Washington Football Team also played three quarterbacks against the New England Patriots. Ryan Fitzpatrick, Taylor Heinicke and Steven Montez all saw action against the Patriots.

If the competition was scored off performance, Mac Jones takes the win.  #3 Steven Montez made a strong case on becoming the backup QB Ryan Fitzpatrick completed five of his eight passes for 58 yards against the Patriots. Taylor Heinicke and Steven Montez are battling for the backup quarterback spot behind Fitzpatrick. Heinicke completed nine of 15 passes for 86 yards.     Steven Montez took full advantage of his opportunity against the New England Patriots. The former Colorado quarterback completed 70% of his passes and made a strong case as the backup. Montez completed 17 of his 24 passes for 108 yards and a touchdown.Washington will get a better look at both Heinicke and Montez as the preseason continues. As of now, Montez outperformed Taylor Heinicke on Thursday night.Also Read: Who is Cam Newton's girlfriend, La Reina Shaw?      "", 'Skip Bayless takes shots at Aaron Rodgers while praising Davante Adams - “Baddest man in Green Bay was Davante”  Davante Adams is ranked as the WR1 in the NFL by PFF ahead of the new season. He was PFF\'s top-ranked receiver last season as well, and despite departing the Green Bay Packers, Adams was able to keep his spot.  Playing without Aaron Rodgers hasn\'t had a negative influence on Adams\' performance, which speaks to the Raiders\' receiver\'s greatness. Skip Bayless recently discussed Adams\' impact on the field, highlighting how, for the past few years, he was the best player in Green Bay, not Rodgers.        Here\'s what Bayless said on Undisputed:           ""For years over on the other show, I had to hear on a regular basis what a bad man Aaron Rodgers was, and yet the truth is over the last three or four years the badder man, the baddest man in Green Bay was Davante. ""Once he left last year, Aaron Rodgers had the 26th best QBR and across the board had his worst stats of his career, and I don\'t think that was a coincidence. I think Davante helped make Aaron what he was especially in the winter of his career.""        It is true that Aaron Rodgers didn\'t look like himself last season without Adams, and his stats showed that. Last season, Rodgers had a passer rating of 91.1 with 3,695 yards, 26 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in 17 games. In comparison, the former Green Bay Packers quarterback had a passer rating of 111.9 with 4,115 yards, 37 touchdowns and four interceptions in 16 games in 2021. Now that Rodgers will play for the New York Jets, he will have the opportunity to prove that he can still play at an MVP level even without Davante Adams.  Davante Adams is at risk of playing without Jimmy Garoppolo next season Davante Adams: Las Vegas Raiders v Kansas City Chiefs     Last season, Davante Adams was able to dominate with Derek Carr as his quarterback, but the team opted to part ways with the latter. In the offseason, the Raiders signed Jimmy Garoppolo, who is more familiar with Josh McDaniels\' system. Adams appeared to be excited to play with Garoppolo, but recent reports have surfaced regarding the quarterback\'s serious injury, which could keep him out of next season. If that happens, the Raiders will almost certainly play with Brian Hoyer, which would be a tremendous disappointment for Adams, who has already expressed his displeasure with the organization.MLFootball@_MLFootballREPORT: QB Jimmy Garoppolo failed his physical with the Las Vegas #Raiders in March, per @ProFootballTalk, via @tashanreed.If Jimmy G doesn\'t pass a physical by the time the season starts, the #Raiders could move on at no cost.🤯🤯🤯6559591REPORT: QB Jimmy Garoppolo failed his physical with the Las Vegas #Raiders in March, per @ProFootballTalk, via @tashanreed.If Jimmy G doesn\'t pass a physical by the time the season starts, the #Raiders could move on at no cost.🤯🤯🤯 https://t.co/Byun4epqsj     If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Undisputed and H/T Sportskeeda.

While they currently sit at second place in the AFC East, the team clearly did not perform well with Newton sidelined. Numbers may not do justice for what Newton has been doing, considering he has been out of football for quite some time prior. The fact that several teams passed on Newton in the offseason also must be fueling his hunger to perform well. Having another hurdle thrown his way due to COVID must be further pushing him to light the Broncos defense on fire.     As for the Broncos, they are already hurting severely on both sides of the ball. While Rypien played alright with the time he had, the Broncos still have to see if Lock is the future of this team. For now, the organization is behind Lock until further notice.Prediction: Patriots win in an effort led by Newton.Also Check Out: Cam Newton’s Best Outfits     "", ""How to watch Patriots vs. Packers tonight? Time, channel & schedule  Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers will look to make it three straight wins when they host the New England Patriots at Lambeau Field on Sunday (October 2).  The Packers' season is seemingly back on track after their shock loss against the Minnesota Vikings in their season-opener. They thrashed divisional rivals Chicago Bears 27-10 before traveling to Raymond James Stadium and beating Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 14-12 in a defensive slugfest.        Rodgers is yet to hit the form that saw him win two straight NFL MVP awards. But two efficient performances in his last two outings will only help the quarterback find his rhythm as he continues to build chemistry with his new receivers.           Meanwhile, the New England Patriots' season is unraveling at an alarming pace. After losing 20-7 to the Miami Dolphins in the season-opener, they managed to steal a win against the Pittsburgh Steelers in their second outing of the season. Their last game against the Baltimore Ravens descended into disaster with every passing quarter. Lamar Jackson helped his side put up 37 points on the scoreboard to secure the win. But the bigger concern for Bill Belchick's team was the injury suffered by quarterback Mac Jones, who is set to miss a significant chunk of the season.

It highlights the major areas where Murray's game takes a hit. His average passer rating goes from 97.43 to 86.65, taking a -7.77 hit on 2XP weekends.His average passing yards per game go from 251 to 245, showing a -6 yard difference.His average completion % also dips from 67.29 to 67.17.     But the most damaging fact for Murray is that his win loss ratio drops drastically from 0.529 to 0.360. These results have got to be eye-opening for the Arizona Cardinals. They recently signed the signal-caller to a massive $230.5 million extension.

The relationship between the Call of Duty double XP weekends and Kyler Murray's performance is there for all to see.      What can we take from these Kyler Murray reports? NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Arizona Cardinals v Los Angeles Rams If these reports are to be taken seriously, it is no surprise that the Cardinals included a (now rescinded) clause in his new contract. The infamous homework clause compelled him to study game tape for four hours before every game without distraction. As to whether this is all just a coincidence is another matter. The quarterback's Call of Duty habits need to be analyzed before drawing any conclusions. Without confirming the hours Kyler Murray spends playing the game over double XP weekends, these reports don't hold up. Comparisons need to be drawn between the hours he plays on normal weekends with double XP weekends, to see if there is an increase in his gaming hours.     Regadless, Kyler Murray will doubtless be displeased with all the attention he is receiving. On the back of the homework clause debacle, he is no doubt wanting to get on with practice. Murray enters his fourth season in the league this campaign. He made the playoffs for the first time in his career last season. The game was a 34-11 Wild Card round loss to the Los Angeles Rams, which proved as disappointing as it was humbling.The Cardinals will be looking to improve on the 2021 campaign and make a deeper push into the playoffs. With regards to Kyler Murray's performances on double XP weekends, it will be interesting to see whether that correlation continues in the new season.

The Arizona Cardinals are yet to offer the former University of Oklahoma standout a contract extension.  NFL analyst Kay Adams explained the situation on Good Morning Football by referring to Murray\'s poor performance in last year\'s playoff loss to the Los Angeles Rams.        “What happened to you? What happened? It wasn\'t just a bad playoff loss. It was an absolute nightmare. And there were so many times in that six-game stretch, that 1-5 game stretch where we\'re like, \'Is it really just DeAndre? Is it really because he’s not here? What\'s going on?’ This is why you can\'t pay him (Murray). This is why the Cardinals have leverage. There are too many questions. Those questions exist for Kyle on the field and a 1-5 game slide that had us all scratching our heads because the talent level’s too high. The coaching has been too good, and we’ve seen what it can be. And then you have the off-the-field questions about what his motivations are.""               Adams further elaborated on why the Cardinals have every reason to not pay their franchise quarterback. ""So if you\'re the Cardinals, why would you pay someone when the last taste in your mouth is a 1-5 stretch with an incredibly mind-numbingly soulless performance in the playoffs. I\'m just going to say it, because I love Kyler, and I love this team, and I think that they can be good.

Arizona Cardinals QB Kyler Murray is having a good season so far but is currently marked as questionable for the upcoming Week 10 game against the Los Angeles Rams. Murray was injured in last week's game, where they lost to the Seattle Seahawks 21-31.  In his last game, Murray threw for 175 yards with two touchdowns and had a pass completion percentage of 71.43. The Cardinals are currently 3-6 and hold the last position in the NFC West. The Week 10 game will be a matchup between the two NFC West teams - the Los Angeles Rams and Arizona Cardinals.        Kyler Murray is closely ranked among the top quarterbacks in the league. If you are thinking of starting with him this week, then you might want to reconsider your decision.           Is Kyler Murray a good fantasy pick? Arizona Cardinals v Seattle Seahawks Kyler Murray made it to the injury list after last week's game against the Seattle Seahawks. He remains questionable as he is suffering a hamstring injury and will most likely sit out in the upcoming game against the Los Angeles Rams.     Murray did not take part in practice on Wednesday and was a limited participant in the next two days of practice sessions. Colt McCoy will start in place of Murray in Sunday's game. If you play fantasy football, then it is best to bench him this week and give your backup quarterback a chance to earn you some fantasy points.     Murray has started all the games for the Cardinals so far and has completed 240 of the 360 passes attempted. He threw for 2,168 yards with 12 touchdowns and six interceptions. In nine games so far, Murray has scored 174.62 fantasy points, averaging 19.4 points per game.     Kyler Murray's performance dipped slightly last year. His rushing game suffered as a result of Cardinals veteran DeAndre Hopkins playing only 10 games, as his rushing stats were nearly half of those of the 2020-21 season.     Hopkins missed the first six games of the season because the NFL banned him for violating the league's performance-enhancing substance policy. Marquise Brown departed the Ravens to aid the Cardinals in the first six games of the season, allowing Murray to be more effective.

The fourth-year head coach was relieved of his duties following the final game of the Cardinals' season. The Cardinals finished in last place in the NFC West at 4-13 and will pick third in the upcoming draft.   That pick will be made by a new head coach, though. There are plenty of options out there for the Cardinals to start over. They hired Kingsbury in 2019 to pair with Kyler Murray but the relationship has not panned out like it was supposed to thus far.         The fired head coach was under contract through the 2027 season, but the Cardinals brass felt it was time to move in a different direction.                Since the season is officially over for all non-playoff teams, of which the Cardinals are, they will begin their coaching search now.  There are likely two main reasons probably why Kliff Kingsbury did not make it out of this season. Team performance has to be a big part of it.  The Cardinals expected to contend in the NFC West. With the Los Angeles Rams being ravished by injuries, a playoff spot in the division had theoretically opened up, but it wasn't taken by Arizona.      In fact, they finished a game worse than the Rams, who had the most losses by a defending Super Bowl champion in history.  Worse for Kliff Kingsbury was the relationship with newly extended quarterback Kyler Murray. The seasonal performance can be attributed to a lot of things- DeAndre Hopkins' initial suspension, Murray's ACL tear and other injuries as well as other problems.  What can't be explained away is the deteriorating relationship between star quarterback and coach. If those two aren't working together, one of them has to go.  Kliff KIngsbury and Kyler Murray didn't work together     Since Murray was extended to a massive deal last offseason, Kingsbury had to go. It was reported throughout the season that their relationship was at an all-time low and they were seen arguing on the sidelines on occasion.   What was Kliff Kingsbury's coaching history and record with Cardinals? Kliff Kingsbury leaves the Cardinals after a 4-13 season, and his overall record isn't sterling, either. Kingsbury coached for four seasons and had a combined record of 28-37-1.   After four years, the coach was unable to even have a .500 record, so the Cardinals elected to move on.

Who will score more fantasy football points in 2022 - Lamar Jackson or Kyler Murray? Currently, quarterbacks are not just limited to throwing accurate long passes. We are seeing amazing rushing abilities in quarterbacks such as Lamar Jackson, Kyler Murray, and Jalen Hurts, which makes them top contenders. Jackson depends much more on his explosive legs. With that in mind, the Ravens have upgraded their offensive line this offseason to reinforce their run game.        The Ravens have lost wideout Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown, but Jackson will have the support of JK Dobbins and Gus Edwards, who are currently in top form. On the other hand, we have Kyler Murray whose performance dropped a bit last year. With Cardinals veteran DeAndre Hopkins playing just 10 games, Murray\'s rushing game also saw a drop as his rushing stats were almost half that of the 2020-21 season. This season, Hopkins will miss his first six games as the NFL suspended him for violating the league\'s performance-enhancing drugs policy. Marquise Brown has left the Ravens and will play with the Cardinals this season, which might help Murray be more productive.For the final verdict, it would be best to pass on Murray and draft Jackson as soon as possible in the early second round of the 2022 fantasy football draft. A lot of Jackson\'s value lies in his drive to get the most out of his 2022-23 season to get that contract extension from the Ravens.     ', 'NFL MVP Race: Latest Power Rankings ft.

NFL MVP Power Rankings        #5 - QB Dak Prescott, Dallas Cowboys           Last week: Unranked Dallas Cowboys QB Dak Prescott Dak Prescott is playing some of the best football of his career this season. He is on pace to set new career highs in yards, touchdowns, completion percentage and passer rating. His strong play is a big reason why the Dallas Cowboys are on an active five-game winning streak. After another impressive performance in Week 6, he has become one of the odds favorites to win NFL MVP this season.     PFF Fantasy Football@PFF_FantasyDak Prescott has 8 games with 400+ passing yards since 2019Nobody else has more than 4 😳3:01 AM · Oct 18, 20213770495Dak Prescott has 8 games with 400+ passing yards since 2019Nobody else has more than 4 😳 https://t.co/r8KBYuqgqn #4 - QB Tom Brady, Tampa Bay Buccaneers Last week: #5 Tampa Bay Buccaneers QB Tom Brady     Tom Brady moved up one spot from the NFL MVP power rankings last week. The oldest quarterback in the NFL continues to defy logic with yet another impressive season. He currently ranks first in passing yards, second in passing touchdowns, fourth in QBR and sixth in passer rating. He is trying to lead the Buccaneers to consecutive Super Bowls. #3 - QB Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills Last week: #1 Buffalo Bills QB Josh Allen Josh Allen fell from first to third this week in the NFL MVP race as the Buffalo Bills lost their Week 6 game against the Tennessee Titans. He played very well but team performance is important in the NFL MVP power rankings. He still has plenty of time left this season to climb back up to the top spot. He is one of the very best dual threat quarterbacks in the NFL and he continues to polish his game.     #2 - QB Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens Last week: #4 Baltimore Ravens QB Lamar Jackson Lamar Jackson continues to do it all for the Baltimore Ravens on their active five-game winning streak. He is somehow still underappreciated right now, and based on the odds he is probably the best value bet for an NFL MVP right now. He currently ranks ninth in passing yards and seventh in rushing yards in the entire NFL. He also has three fourth-quarter comebacks this season. Jamison Hensley@jamisonhensleyJohn Harbaugh when asked about the assertion that the NFL was going to figure out Lamar Jackson: ""If you’re looking for your headline here, I think the people who make those statements are kind of whistling in the graveyard just a little bit. It doesn’t have any meaning.""3:13 AM · Oct 18, 202147240John Harbaugh when asked about the assertion that the NFL was going to figure out Lamar Jackson: ""If you’re looking for your headline here, I think the people who make those statements are kind of whistling in the graveyard just a little bit. It doesn’t have any meaning.""     #1 - QB Kyler Murray, Arizona Cardinals Last week: #2 Arizona Cardinals QB Kyler Murray Kyler Murray reclaims top spot in NFL MVP race after just one week away. He continues to be extremely efficient as the Arizona Cardinals are the only remaining undefeated team in the NFL. He leads the NFL in completion percentage while ranking third in yards per attempt, passer rating and QBR. He is currently the best player on the best team, which carries significant value.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Bye Weeks 2021 Schedule     ', 'DeAndre Hopkins suspended for violating league guidelines  Arizona Cardinals wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins has been suspended for six games for violating the NFL\'s Performance Enhancing Drug Policy. The Cardinals will now be without the 29-year-old for the first month and a half of the new league season due to the suspension.  An NFL spokesperson released a statement on the suspension of Hopkins:        ""DeAndre Hopkins of the Arizona Cardinals has been suspended without pay for the first six games of the 2022 regular season for violating the NFL\'s policy on performance-enhancing substances. Hopkins is eligible to participate in all preseason practices and games. He will be allowed to return to the Cardinals\' active roster following the team\'s sixth regular-season game.""           According to the NFL’s PED Policy, using performance-enhancing drugs like exogenous testosterone, along with anabolic or androgenic steroids, is banned by every sanctioning body across the world. The league began testing its players in 1987 and then started to hand out suspensions back in 1989 if players violated this policy.

Did the Cardinals know about Hopkins PED violation prior to the draft? Arizona Cardinals v Cleveland Browns The Cardinals produced perhaps the biggest surprise of the first-round of the NFL Draft as they traded a first-round pick to the Baltimore Ravens in exchange for Marquise Brown.     Now with the news of Hopkins\' violation, it gives us far more insight into the dealings of the Cardinals on draft night. Securing the services of Brown to appease the loss of the 29-year-old is certainly a smart move.    At the time of the trade, many were left wondering how on earth it could happen and why Arizona chose to add another star weapon around Kyler Murray. Well, now it has become just that little bit clearer.     Adding Brown will certainly help Arizona while the former Texans star is serving his six-game suspension. After a poor ending to the 2021 season, the Cardinals will be looking to improve on what looked like an incredible season.Arizona started the year 7-0, before finishing with an 11-6 record and ultimately tumbled out of the postseason. They were defeated in the wildcard 34-11 by the eventual champions, the Los Angeles Rams.     ']"

McCarron after former Bengals QB delivers MVP-esque performance in XFL - “Would’ve been better than Dalton""  There have been many detractors of the XFL, but for former NFL quarterback A.J. McCarron, he is putting his best foot forward in showing people how good the league can be.  In what was one of the best XFL performances in its history, McCarron put on a show for the St.Louis Battlehawks against the Orlando Guardians. McCarron completed 28 of his 35 passes for 420 yards and six touchdowns in the 53-28 rout of Orlando.

', 'Von Miller praises Teddy Bridgewater for leadership after Week 1 win  Many were wary about Teddy Bridgewater being named the starting QB for the Denver Broncos this season. He was 4-11 as a starter with the Carolina Panthers in 2020 and 5-1 over two years with the New Orleans Saints.   He may not have had the best preseason performance, but head coach Vic Fangio saw something in him that Drew Lock didn\'t. Von Miller may have seen the same thing now.        Teddy Bridgewater with a big debut for the @Broncos! 👏 pic.twitter.com/bHkYb91IFg— theScore (@theScore) September 12, 2021           The former Defensive Player of the Year and eight-time Pro Bowl LB has seen his fair share of heartbreaking seasons and inconsistent QBs: Tim Tebow, Kyle Orton, Trevor Siemian, Brock Osweiler, Paxton Lynch, Case Keenum, Joe Flacco, Brandon Allen, Jeff Driskel, Brett Rypien, Brandon Allen and Drew Lock.  There was the era of Peyton Manning from 2012 to 2015 where Von Miller played two Super Bowls and won one. Since Manning retired, it has been a rough going for the Broncos. With Teddy Bridgewater, it seems like things were still going to be the same.     Against the New York Giants in Week 1, Teddy Bridgewater went 28/36 (77.78%) for 264 yards and two TDs. I would say that was better than most people expected him to play, and he showed great accuracy on his intermediate throws. ""I haven\'t felt that in a while - since 18 was here man.""Von Miller showed some love to Teddy Bridgewater on the sideline 🧡(via broncos/TT) pic.twitter.com/PrVeLUm6YF— B/R Gridiron (@brgridiron) September 14, 2021  Is Aaron Rodgers replacing Teddy Bridgewater at the Denver Broncos? Von Miller and Teddy Bridgewater had an intimate moment that was caught on tape on the sideline during the game. Miller told Teddy that he hadn\'t felt that way in a long time, since back when ""18 was here"".      The reference of 18 was Peyton Manning. Miller praised Teddy Bridgewater for his pep talks, and said they go a long way. His pep talks obviously worked well enough to get the win in Week 1.  It\'s also a huge positive for Teddy, as his leadership skills shine along with his abilities on the field. Vic Fangio may have made the right call after all by going with Teddy over Drew Lock. Teddy Bridgewater with another clutch throw on 4th down. pic.twitter.com/X5hOm7mkvi— Joe Rowles (@JoRo_NFL) September 12, 2021 If Teddy Bridgewater is able to keep this pace and his locker room in check, the Denver Broncos seem to have the roster to make the NFL playoffs as a sneaky good wildcard team.  Teddy Bridgewater will need to avoid turnovers that cost the team the victory and stay accurate with his throws, though. Hell, those Aaron Rodgers rumors of him joining the Denver Broncos could be over by the trade deadline at this rate. That was especially after how bad Aaron Rodgers was in Week 1 and how good Teddy Bridgewater fared during the same week.     ', ""Cincinnati Bengals vs Washington Football Team prediction, team news and preview – August 20 | NFL preseason 2021  Another NFC vs. AFC clash is in store in Week 2 of the 2021 NFL preseason on Friday night as the Cincinnati Bengals visit Washington D.C.  The Washington Football team dropped their opening game of the preseason against the New England Patriots, succumbing to a 22-13 defeat. WFT head coach Ron Rivera will be aiming for a win in front of their home fans on Friday night.        Meanwhile, the Cincinnati Bengals are coming off a big preseason road win over the defending Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bengals ruined the Bucs' first game back after their Super Bowl victory with a hard-fought 19-14 win.           Head coach Zac Taylor told reporters after the game that he was happy with his team’s first performance of the 2021 preseason. “I was encouraged by a lot of things I saw,” Taylor said. Now that we've set the table for Friday night's game, here’s a look at how the two teams will line up. Cincinatti Bengals at Washington: Team news Bengals starting quarterback Joe Burrow will once again be watching the action on the sidelines. The 24-year-old is still recovering from a torn ACL in his knee and is racing to be fit for Week 1 of the regular season. With Burrow out, we will be seeing a lot of backup quarterbacks Brandon Allen and Kyle Shurmur under center.     Rookie wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase caught his first pass in the NFL last week and we may see him more involved in tomorrow night's game. Bengals running back Joe Mixon could also get more snaps against Washington. They see me rollin'... pic.twitter.com/5FHxoLnBct— Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) August 18, 2021 The Washington Football Team know who their starting quarterback will be come Week 1. On Friday night, head coach Ron Rivera will likely give veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick only a series or two in Week 2 of the preseason. Look for Taylor Heinicke and Steven Montez to get the majority of the snaps against the Bengals.     Rivera also kept his defensive stars Chase Young and Montez Sweat on the sidelines for most of the game versus the New England Patriots. It’s unlikely he will want to risk them getting injured in a preseason hit-out. Views from the office— Washington Football Team (@WashingtonNFL) August 18, 2021 Cincinnati Bengals at Washington: Prediction Predicting any NFL preseason game is like flipping a coin. The fact that Washington is at home and they lost their preseason opener makes me believe they will be focused on getting the win here.     Again, it will be a close affair with a late field goal sealing it for Ron Rivera’s squad.Prediction: Washington beats Cincinnati 24-21.Also Check Out: Complete Washington Football Team NFL Preseason Schedule 2021     "", ""NFL Training Camp 2021: 5 Cincinnati Bengals players on the roster bubble heading into training camp  Being the only team in the AFC North to not have a winning record in 2020 is something the Cincinnati Bengals want to fix. Rookie quarterback Joe Burrow showed a lot of promise before going down with a knee injury mid-season.   The Bengals also used the 2021 draft as a way to reinforce other positions on the active roster. So who will see themselves on the outside of the final roster cut at the end of preseason play?                   5 Cincinnati Bengals players on the roster bubble  #5 - Brandon Allen, QB The Bengals have found their franchise quarterback in Joe Burrow. Training camp is going to be the telling sign as to who will sit behind Burrow on the depth chart. With pre-season games scheduled this year, unlike in 2020, there will actually be a quarterback competition for the depth chart. Quarterbacks Kyle Shurmur and Eric Dungey are both on the roster and could be reliable options to serve as backup to Burrow.  #4 - Darius Phillips, CB The offseason signings of Mike Hilton and Eli Apple have both hindered the chances of Darius Phillips making the roster at the end of training camp. Considering he hasn't been able to get more playing time before those signings, he is unlikely to have an opportunity to make a name for himself this summer either. The #Bengals aren’t done. They’re signing former #Steelers CB Mike Hilton, source said.— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) March 16, 2021      #3 - Billy Price, C One of the Bengals' main priorities has been to protect their franchise quarterback Joe Burrow. Last season, Burrow didn't get enough protection from the offensive line and went down with a severe knee injury. In the offseason, the Bengals have used the draft and free agency to make improvements to the line. With that being said, Billy Price hasn't shown enough as of late to prove he is a starter leading the Bengals to not pick up a fifth-year option on his contract. This means he will be a free agent at the end of the season.   #2 - Austin Seibert, K Kicker Austin Seibert will be competing for the placekicker job against fifth-round draft pick Evan McPherson. The Bengals clearly weren't thrilled with Seibert's performance in 2020 and they decided to use a fifth-round draft pick on a kicker. Seibert's career field goal percentage is slightly over 80%.  #1 - Mason Schreck, TE     A former seventh-round draft pick, Mason Schrek has spent most of his career on the Bengals' practice squad. However, he has shown a lot of promise in the time he has gotten on the field. The Bengals now have Burrow's LSU teammate Thaddeus Moss, Mitchell Wilcox and C.J. Uzomah all competing for the tight-end starting job.Who are the offensive sleepers to know at Cincinnati Bengals training camp? https://t.co/8bbr8YdIUf— The Bengals Wire (@TheBengalsWire) June 28, 2021     "", 'NFL: 5 takeaways from the Cowboys\' Week 14 win over the Bengals  With their playoff and NFC East division title hopes fading fast, the Dallas Cowboys were able to secure a much-needed win against the reeling Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday, by a final tally of 30-7.  Here is what we learned about both teams.                   5. Cowboys Caught The Right Team At The Right Time Even in a historically bad year for the NFC East, the Cowboys\' season was on life support as the team headed to Cincinnati for a must-win Week 14 matchup. There wasn’t much reason to believe that after a thorough beating at the hands of the Baltimore Ravens this past Tuesday, the Cowboys would muster up enough of an effort to handle business against another AFC North opponent on the road. As luck and good fortune would have it, they faced a Bengals team even more downtrodden and dysfunctional than they were, and to their credit, the Cowboys were able to make them pay for their mistakes. The Bengals lost three fumbles on the day, one each by running backs Trayveon Williams and Giovani Bernard, and another by wide receiver Alex Erickson. It’s hard for any team to overcome that many turnovers, and the Cowboys defense finally had a redeeming performance to get their confidence back up.     Defense showing 🆙📺 #DALvsCIN on FOX pic.twitter.com/dBVuYKVuA6— Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) December 13, 2020  4. We Saw The Old A.J. Green For most of the season, we saw an old A.J. Green—which is to say, a receiver who was not getting separation, not coming down with 50-50 balls, and thus, not being targeted the way star receivers normally get looked at. A.J. Green can no longer be considered as such after a lost season last year due to injury, and what amounts to another M.I.A campaign due to ineffectiveness on his part and lackluster QB play after Joe Burrow’s injury, but today, we got a glimpse of what fans were used to seeing from No. 18 earlier last decade.     He finished the Cowboys\' game with 62 yards on 6 catches, including one touchdown in the second quarter. A.J. caps a big drive with 6️⃣📺: #DALvsCIN on FOX pic.twitter.com/GmJTsvfnDP— Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) December 13, 2020 It will be interesting to see if Green would want to return to the only NFL home he’s ever known next season, or if he will expect the kind of money commensurate with the seasons he had before his recent dip. He’s a free agent after the 2020 season.  3. Tony Pollard Is An Intriguing Piece For Dallas     Tony Pollard falls into a category fantasy players know all too well—If he, Alexander Mattison, Chase Edmonds, or Latavius Murray, for example, ever supplanted or replaced the starters ahead of them, they would be in line to put up monster workloads based on opportunity and talent. It seems like each time Pollard gets a chance for the Cowboys, albeit in a limited role behind Pro Bowl RB Ezekiel Elliott, he does something that makes fans’ eyebrows raise. Pollard came out like gangbusters at the beginning of the second half, showing extreme burst returning the kickoff back for 60 yards all the way into Bengals territory. On the second to last drive of the game, he caught a seven yard pass from QB Andy Dalton to put the cherry on top of Dallas’ victory. ""Tony\'s playing excellent football for us. I thought he had a heck of a day.""TP continues to shine as a kickoff returner & RB— Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) December 14, 2020     Pollard is probably overqualified to be an insurance back in the NFL, but at cap hits just over $1 million each of the next seasons, the Cowboys must feel extremely lucky to have him in their backfield should anything happen to Elliott.  2. Bengals Need To Upgrade Their Backup QB Situation To be fair, not every team has a Ryan Tannehill or Taysom Hill type of talent waiting in the wings, and it’s unfair to expect every team in the league to have competent quarterbacks in reserve. But it’s clear that without Joe Burrow(and the Bengals might not have his services at the start of the 2021 season), the team cannot function well enough to even be competitive in games. Granted, they’re in a tough division, and would not have made noise this season even had the number one overall pick not gotten hurt, but they’ll need someone better than a Brandon Allen or Ryan Finley to come in to keep the team afloat in future seasons.      1. The Cowboys Won The Andy Dalton Bowl In addition to the division storylines for the Cowboys, the other major plotline for this game was veteran QB Andy Dalton’s return to Cincinnati, where he played nine seasons for the Bengals. When it became clear last season that the Bengals were not going to include the “Red Rifle” as part of their future, reports stated that Dalton had begun to prepare for a future outside of the Queen City. While Dalton was not able to land a starting gig of his own elsewhere, it was a special moment for him to come back to the city where he started his career and show that he still has some juice left in the tank. ""This one was special.""@andydalton14 | #DallasCowboys— Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) December 14, 2020     It’s unclear what the future with the Cowboys holds for the former TCU standout, but he may not get too many chances to face his old team down the line, so at least for one Sunday, Dalton could savor a victory against the organization that no longer believed in his ability..@andydalton14\'s first TD back in Cincinnati goes to COOOOP!!📺 #DALvsCIN on FOX pic.twitter.com/xIqLvaVod8— Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) December 13, 2020     ', ""Broncos QBs since Peyton Manning: Every starter since Hall of Famer retired in 2016  Ever since Peyton Manning retired in 2016, after winning his second Super Bowl overall and his first with the Denver Broncos, the franchise has gone through upheaval every year at the quarterback position. It is a notoriously difficult place to fill at the best of times, but it is especially difficult when someone is trying to replace an all-time great like Peyton Manning.  We take a look at every starter who has played for the Denver Broncos in that position since Peyton Manning's retirement. As this has been such an unstable position for the franchise after Peyton Manning, in most seasons, they have had multiple starters in the given position. So, for the purposes of clarity, only those who started most games are listed at the top and others who played in those seasons are mentioned separately.                       Denver Broncos quarterbacks since Peyton Manning retired 2016 and 2017 - Trevor Siemian Right after Peyton Manning retired, Brock Osweiler, who had started some of the games the previous year with Peyton Manning in their Super Bowl-winning season, left for the Houston Texans to become their starter. That opened up the field for third-choice Trevor Siemian to compete with rookie Paxton Lynch and veteran Mark Sanchez, and Siemian eventually became the starter.     James Palmer@JamesPalmerTVTrevor Siemian is the only QB with a winning record for the #Broncos since Peyton Manning retired entering the 2016 seasonTrevor Siemian (13-11), Case Keenum (6-10), Paxton Lynch (1-3), Joe Flacco (0-4) and Brock Osweiler (0-4)35588Trevor Siemian is the only QB with a winning record for the #Broncos since Peyton Manning retired entering the 2016 seasonTrevor Siemian (13-11), Case Keenum (6-10), Paxton Lynch (1-3), Joe Flacco (0-4) and Brock Osweiler (0-4) In 2016, he played 14 of 16 games for the Denver Broncos (the last two weeks were quarterbacked by Paxton Lynch) and established himself as the first choice. Even though the Broncos missed the playoffs, he finished with a passer rating of 84.6 that was higher than Peyton Manning and Brock Osweiler from the previous season. Over the last six weeks of his season from Weeks 8 to 14, he averaged more than 300 yards, behind only Tom Brady and Kirk Cousins. He was named a Pro Bowl alternate but did not accept the invitation due to the shoulder surgery he went ahead with after Week 14.        In 2017, now firmly established as a starter but under new coach Vance Joseph, he began the season strongly, and the high point was a game against the Dallas Cowboys where he threw four touchdowns. In Week 6, he suffered a shoulder injury. Then, over the next few weeks, his production declined. He was benched in favor of the returning Brock Osweiler in Week 9, who was himself then relieved by Paxton Lynch in Week 12. After Lynch was injured in that game, Siemian got another chance to lead the Broncos. But another shoulder injury in Week 15 spelled the end of his career with the Broncos as Brock Osweiler relieved him in that game and started in Week 16.     2018 - Case Keenum After the upheaval of the previous season, when the Broncos had three quarterbacks trading places, head coach Vance Joseph chose to reunite with former Houston Texans quarterback Case Keenum, who they traded from the Minnesota Vikings. They stuck with him throughout the season and he started all 16 games as the Broncos went 6-10.    He threw for 3,890 yards with a 62.3 completion rate. He had 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, with a 81.2 passer rating. He was traded to the Washington Redskins for a seventh-round pick in 2019.     2019 - Joe Flacco In 2019, the Denver Broncos decided to go with Joe Flacco, who had won one Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens. There were eerie parallels with Peyton Manning as they plumped for a veteran quarterback and former Super Bowl MVP. He was named the starter and had the job until he faced a neck injury in Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts. In those eight games that he started, he had 1,822 passing yards, six touchdowns, five interceptions, and an 85.1 passer rating. He was subsequently released by the Broncos and went on to sign with the New York Jets, where he still is currently.        After Joe Flacco was injured, he was replaced by Brandon Allen for three games before Drew Lock stepped in for the final five games of the season. The rookie quarterback finished with 1,020 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions in those five games and equalled John Elway's franchise record for most wins by a rookie in Broncos history. His four wins came in just five games compared to the 10 taken by Elway. Peter Baugh@Peter_BaughDrew Lock's rookie year stats for the #Broncos: •5 games played •1,020 yards (204 a game)•7 TD•3 interceptions •4-1 record776Drew Lock's rookie year stats for the #Broncos: •5 games played •1,020 yards (204 a game)•7 TD•3 interceptions •4-1 record 2020 - Drew Lock For his performances the previous season, Lock was named the starter for 2020. In Week 2, he injured his shoulder and would not return until Week 6. During that period, Jeff Driskel and Brett Rypien started one game each. In Week 12, due to a COVID outbreak among the quarterback corps, running back Phillip Lindsay started under center.     Lock's performances in his second season were not up to standard. Case in point, he had 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. This was the joint highest in the league , tied with Carson Wentz, despite Lock only playing 13 matches. His 57.3 completion rate was the lowest among all quarterbacks with, at least, 150 passing attempts that season.    2021 - Teddy Bridgewater In 2021, Teddy Bridgewater, the 2015 Pro Bowler, joined the team from the Carolina Panthers. He beat out Drew Lock to become the starter, though Lock started three games in each of which Bridgewater was out injured. In the 13 games that he started, he threw for 3,052 yards, 18 touchdowns, and seven interceptions for a passer rating of 94.9 with a 66.9 completion percentage. At the end of the season, he was traded to the Miami Dolphins as the Denver Broncos acquired Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks.     2022 - Russell Wilson   Russell Wilson joined from the Seattle Seahawks. In a deal that sent Drew Lock to Seattle, along with other players and draft picks, the future hall-of-famer joined the Denver Broncos for a five-year, $245 million deal. The Broncos will hope to replicate the success they had with Peyton Manning when they last had a future hall-of-famer as their quarterback.     ""]"
68,Case Keenum,"['Who Will be the Vikings Quarterback?  We all know what\'s happening in Minnesota: a quarterback situation.  Three quarterbacks heading into free agency and what can we expect from the Minnesota Vikings front office to do about it? Here\'s a backstory:        Quarterback (QB) Teddy Bridgewater was the franchise QB the team needed and was performing well. In 2016, he severely injured his left leg and did not play until the Week 15 of 2017 season. As a result of his injury, the Vikings traded for QB Sam Bradford from the Philadelphia Eagles in 2016. He performed well until an injury to his knee in 2017 and played just one game that season. This time, QB Case Keenum was brought in.  Keenum\'s performance left my jaw dropping, and certainly many others too. He did not look like the same player under Jeff Fisher\'s system with the Los Angeles Rams. But now that all three quarterbacks are free agents, what should the Vikings do? This is my take on what the front office should do: - It\'s obvious that QB needy teams will pursue Keenum, and after his performance, I believe the Vikings should give him another one or two year ""prove it"" deal that will solidify whether or not Keenum is the answer for the foreseeable future. However, the Vikings can also place the franchise tag on Keenum, which would give him around $23 million     - \u200eBridgewater is still a young guy who is capable of starting somewhere. But on what team? If the Vikings bring back Keenum, I believe they will bring Bridgewater back as well - \u200eEven though the Vikings gave the Eagles a 1st round pick for Bradford, I don\'t think it\'s worth keeping him simply because of his issues with staying healthy. Bradford will not be pursued by the Vikings and will hit the QB market. He will likely end up on a team in need of a backupAgain, this is what I think the front office should do, currently it is unclear what will happen.

Those who have followed the NFL closely over the last ten years are well aware of Case Keenum. But for those who don't keep tabs on every player in the league and are wondering who Case Keenum is, here's a look at his football journey so far.        Where did Case Keenum go to college?           Case Keenum played five years in college for the Houston Cougars. Keenum, a prolific passer, eclipsed 40 touchdowns in three of the five years he spent with the team. His freshman year and his junior year were the only years he didn't pass for at least 40 touchdowns. Tom Withers@twithersAPCase Keenum: “I’m ready for this.

In 2011, Keenum threw for 48 touchdowns and five interceptions, while completing 71% of his pass attempts. These were all career-high numbers and set him up nicely for the NFL Draft, or so many thought. He ended up slipping through every round and didn't have a team at the end of Day 3, going undrafted.     Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterBrowns announce QB Case Keenum will start versus Broncos.7:36 AM · Oct 20, 2021156011294Browns announce QB Case Keenum will start versus Broncos. Who has Case Keenum played for in the NFL? Case Keenum has played for six teams since entering the league in 2013. His first year in the NFL was with the Houston Texans, who were enjoying a run with Matt Schaub. The Texans went 22-10 from 2011-2012. Keenum's role was mostly passive, but he did play enough to throw for 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions in those two years.         Keenum's performances were not exceptional, but they were good enough to land him with the struggling St. Louis Rams. The team essentially lost at quarterback. Keenum and Nick Foles alternated time on the field before Jared Goff ultimately stole the job. Post that, the Rams moved on from Keenum. He threw 13 touchdowns and 12 interceptions between 2015 and 2016. Keenum then landed with the Minnesota Vikings, which ended up being the most successful stint of his career. Despite being only a year long, his time with the Vikings was massive for Keenum's career. He took over mid-way through the season after Sam Bradford went down with an injury. In 14 starts, Keenum went 11-3 while throwing 22 touchdowns and seven interceptions.     The Vikings eventually made the playoffs, where Keenum played a defining role in one of the greatest playoff moments in NFL history, sending their careers to the next level. Keenum moved on from the Vikings, who signed Kirk Cousins, and landed with the Denver Broncos. The team had big hopes for Keenum, but it didn't work out. The Broncos went 6-10 that season, with Keenum throwing for 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. After a disappointing season, the Broncos moved on from Keenum. Keenum then spent time with the Washington Football Team, where he went 1-7 in eight starts and threw for 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He was then picked up by the Browns as the backup to Baker Mayfield.With Mayfield out due to injury, Keenum has a chance to show that he can play at the same level that he did during his time with the Vikings.Will Keenum see a resurgence, or will this be the final confirmation that his time with the Vikings was a fluke?

Baker obviously wants to be out there but just couldn’t make it on a short week,” said HC Kevin Stefanski. “We know he will continue to do everything in his power to return as quickly as possible.” Baker Mayfield will miss Week 7 due to an injury. The Cleveland Browns are set to take on the Denver Broncos on Thursday Night Football. Case Keenum has already officially been named the starter. Baker Mayfield joins a long list of key injuries for the Browns in Week 7 including Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt. The Browns will also be without starting offensive tackles in Week 7.

The back-ups will have their hands full with superstar Von Miller and company. Case Keenum will make his first start for the Browns and try to steal a much-needed win on Thursday night. He and Kevin Stefanski had some success together when they were both with the Minnesota Vikings in 2017. Week 7 quarterback dilemmas #2 - Davis Mills, Houston Texans Week 7 could be the end of Davis Mills\' run as the starting quarterback of the Houston Texans. The rookie quarterback out of Stanford was drafted in the third round by the Texans to be more of a project. He was never really supposed to start in 2021, but between the Deshaun Watson situation and veteran Tyrod Taylor being injured, his opportunity came sooner than expected. NFL on CBS 🏈@NFLonCBSThe only rookie QB to pass for 300+ yards and 3+ TD against the Bill Belichick-coached Patriots:- Davis Mills3:36 AM · Oct 10, 20219225The only rookie QB to pass for 300+ yards and 3+ TD against the Bill Belichick-coached Patriots:- Davis Mills https://t.co/bo0ldZM99O     Coming into Week 7 his numbers have been pretty decent, all things considered. They haven\'t been too far behind the rest of the rookie quarterbacks for the most part. If Tyrod Taylor is healthy enough to return in Week 7, it is likely that he will get the starting quarterback job back, for now. The Houston Texans are going nowhere this year, so Davis Mills may get another opportunity at some point. #1 - Jimmy Garoppolo, San Francisco 49ers The San Francisco 49ers continue to have one of the most interesting quarterback situations in the entire NFL. If both Jimmy Garoppolo and Trey Lance are healthy in Week 7, it is still unknown which of the two will be given the start. Lance started the first game of his career in the 49ers\' last game, but Garoppolo was injured. Chris Biderman@ChrisBidermanJimmy Garoppolo (calf) will be limited at today\'s practice, Kyle Shanahan says. Trey Lance (knee) will not practice. DT Javon Kinlaw (knee) will not practice. #49ers3:35 AM · Oct 20, 2021101Jimmy Garoppolo (calf) will be limited at today\'s practice, Kyle Shanahan says. Trey Lance (knee) will not practice. DT Javon Kinlaw (knee) will not practice. #49ers Garoppolo is the ""safer"" option while Lance has much more upside. Garoppolo is a veteran who can win games but is an average quarterback. Lance is an unproven rookie with impressive athleticism and a ton of potential. It will be interesting to see who starts in Week 7 if both are healthy. If Lance gets the opportunity, the job could be his for the rest of the 2021 NFL season.

Three players to replace Browns RB Kareem Hunt in fantasy football #1 - D'Ernest Johnson - Cleveland Browns NBC Sports EDGE@NBCSportsEdgeWith Kareem Hunt and Nick Chubb both out Thursday night, D'Ernest Johnson is stepping into an immediate role with an RB2 floor. 📈See the rest of @notJDaigle's recommendations and analysis: bit.ly/3G2EALJ4:28 AM · Oct 19, 2021334With Kareem Hunt and Nick Chubb both out Thursday night, D'Ernest Johnson is stepping into an immediate role with an RB2 floor. 📈See the rest of @notJDaigle's recommendations and analysis: bit.ly/3G2EALJ https://t.co/Xsulce2SEU It might be wise to snag the Browns' third-string running back in deeper leagues. The matchup isn't the greatest for D'Ernest Johnson since he faces the Denver Broncos. But Najee Harris had a good fantasy football performance against them a few weeks ago. Johnson is a decent streaming option with little competition for carries. Add to it, the fact that Baker Mayfield isn't 100% and could not play. Johnson's value rises with Case Keenum on the field. Johnson could be valuable as long as Kareem Hunt is out.     #2 - JD McKissic - Washington Football Team The Wire Fantasy Football Podcast@TheWireFFBJD Mckissic has finished as a top 15 PPR RB in 3 of the past 5 weeks With Gibson getting an MRI on his shin go get Mckissic where you can1:22 AM · Oct 19, 202141JD Mckissic has finished as a top 15 PPR RB in 3 of the past 5 weeks With Gibson getting an MRI on his shin go get Mckissic where you can JD McKissic ended up with 19 fantasy football points against the Kansas City Chiefs thanks to Antonio Gibson's lower leg injury. An MRI could see Gibson being shelved for several weeks, with McKissic taking advantage of his new role. Either way, McKissic should still be a viable waiver pickup against the Green Bay Packers this week. He is more of a rental until Kareem Hunt is healthy, but should get you at least one week of production.     #3 - Elijah Mitchell - San Francisco 49ers San Francisco 49ers v Detroit Lions Elijah Mitchell is an option for the risk-takers in fantasy football and you could end up with a second RB2 to pair with Kareem Hunt once he's healthy. Mitchell is the top option in the backfield, but quarterback Trey Lance led the team in rushing last week. Mitchell hasn't seen many looks this season, but the 49ers would be smart to use Mitchell more and let Lance focus on passing. They could end up with a new productive member of the backfield because of it.

The Washington Redskins agreed to trade for quarterback Alex Smith from the Kansas City Chiefs in late January thus resetting the QB market even before the season ended. Two teams already had two new quarterbacks before the Eagles could beat out the defending champions in February.  The trade freed the embattled ex-Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins to sign with the Minnesota Vikings in Free agency. The Vikings, who made it to the NFC Championship game, had three starting-caliber quarterbacks and let them all hit the free agency and signed Cousins to a first-ever full guaranteed contract.        Weeks prior to the start of free agency it was obvious that the Cousins-Vikings marriage is inevitable, which prompted the MVP of Vikings season Case Keenum to struck a deal with Denver Broncos even before the Cousins deal was finalized. This Keenum deal started the domino effect with many teams that are in the QB market started making deals.           Cleveland Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor from the Buffalo Bills, one of many trades they made this offseason. Arizona Cardinals signed Sam Bradford, New York Jets Signed Teddy Bridgewater and then traded him to the New Orleans Saints after an amazing preseason. AJ McCarron signed with the Bills and got beat out by rookie Josh Allen to become the starter which prompted the Bills to trade him to Oakland. Speaking of rookies, the 2018 draft had as many as Five QBs taken in round 1. By Week 4, four of the 5 are starting and the fifth QB is already seeing some game action in trick plays.     Including both the Veterans and Rookies, there are as many as Eight teams who had new Quarterbacks starting for them this year. Let's take a look at how these QBs fared so far with their new teams. Let's start with a Bonus player, the man who took the league by surprise and then crash landed in week 4:  BONUS: Ryan Fitzpatrick (2-2)  Oh, where to start. When I first started to think about this article after week 2, I had him competing for the number 1 spot with the current number 1 and then week 4 happened and the head coach Dirk Koetter has announced that Jameis Winston will be starting after the week 5 bye.     Since, FitzMagic is just a placeholder for Winston, who was serving his 3-game suspension, I decided not to include him in the rankings but thought he deserved a shout-out for his performance through the first three weeks. He went 2-2 in his starts when no one expected him to be anything better than 1-3. He faced three playoff teams from last year and went 2-1 in those games and came close to being 3-0 while trying to make an epic comeback against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 3. He posted 400 yards in each of his first three games, an NFL record. But week 4 proved why Fitzpatrick is who he is, a journeyman quarterback. The four-game stretch should help him get more money in the next offseason and will be a highly paid backup QB. #8 Josh Rosen/Sam Bradford, Arizona Cardinals (0-4)      Two teams have already started two quarterbacks who were not on their roster last season, one of them is Arizona Cardinals. Cardinals, who saw both their quarterback and head coach retire after last season had a complete overhaul in coaching and QB room. The added three quarterbacks including Mike Glennon. Sam Bradford, who is coming off injuries, signed a 1 year 20 million dollar contract and became a presumed starter. But, the Cardinals are off to a terrible start losing out in all the three starts prompting the change to go with the rookie Josh Rosen. Bradford in his three starts completed 62.5% of his passes for 400 yards and two touchdowns. But, he also had four INTs to his name. Bradford, couldn't move the ball well under Mike McCoy's game plan. He struggled in the first 2 games where the offense only scored 6 points in total. He started off well in the Week 3 matchup against the Chicago Bears where he tossed two TDs to start the game, but then couldn't find the momentum in the rest of the game which paved the way for the rookies Josh Rosen to come in the fourth quarter and try to win the game which was a very close contest.         Rosen was named starter for week 4 and quietly had an impressive debut. Rosen probably threw for only 180 yards but kept the Cardinals in the game without making any stupid mistakes. Cardinals eventually lost to the Russell Wilson's Seahawks, but had a glimpse of their bright future. The Cardinals running game needs to be picked up. The O-line has been one of the worst in the league, which handcuffed one of the elite tailbacks in David Johnson.     This Cardinals offense reminds me of 2016 Rams team which made Todd Gurley, Jared Goff and Case Keenum do nothing. This Cardinals offense is doing the same to David Johnson, Josh Rosen and Larry Fitzerald. Look for a coaching change to come this off season even though it is the first season as a head coach for Steve Wilks, at the very least the OC needs to be changed. With the correct play caller, this offense is capable of some high flying action ala Chiefs, Rams and the Texans. #7 Josh Allen/Nathan Peterman, Buffalo Bills (1-3)      Buffalo Bills had one of the strangest QB competition in NFL this offseason. They had three quarterbacks in the battle for the starting spot during the training camp. All thought that it would be AJ McCarron but instead as the preseason approached McCarron became third stringer and expendable, thus his trade to Raiders. The Bill surprisingly announced Nathan Peterman over the rookie Josh Allen as the starter for week 1, but Peterman repeated his first start performance from last year when he threw for 5 picks. He threw 2 picks and scored nothing, which led for the rookie Josh Allen to take the reigns. Allen in his three starts the next three weeks, completed only 53.4% of passes throwing just two touchdowns with four picks. His best game came in week 3 when the Buffalo Bills stunned the world by beating the Minnesota Vikings. Allen had three total TDs, 2 of them coming on the ground, showing off his athleticism in that game. But, he came back to earth in week 4, throwing 2 picks against an average Packers defense.     Allen, as expected, is raw and playing like a typical rookie. In an ideal scenario, he could use a redshirt season before taking over the reigns like Patrick Mahomes, but he did not have the luxury of learning under someone like Alex Smith, instead, the situation has thrust him into starting role early. He is going to have some growing pains but if week 3 is any indication he is going to be big in long term. #6 Baker Mayfield/Tyrod Taylor, Cleveland Browns (1-2-1)      This is the second team in the list that already had two starters who were not on the roster last season. The Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor during the offseason. A month later the Browns picked Baker Mayfield with the number 1 overall pick. Mayfield was supposed to be redshirted this season with Taylor holding the place for the year at least until the Browns are out of Playoff contention. But with Taylor's concussion in Week 3 Thursday Night matchup against the Jets, Mayfield came in late second quarter and helped Browns mount the comeback and give the franchise its first win in 17 games. Browns had a great start to the season, mostly thanks to the defense which stifled Ben Roethlisberger in Week 1. Drew Brees also had a tough time playing against this defense. Browns started 0-1-1 in the first two weeks and entered week 3 as favorites for the first time in almost two seasons.     Tyrod Taylor apart from a couple of plays had a tough start to his Browns tenure. That bad form continued in week 3. The first half of that game was unwatchable with Tyrod under center. But, when Mayfield came into the game, the dynamics changed. Browns offense is fun to watch after a very long time, He made the plays that Tyrod Taylor would hesitate to do.     Mayfield brought the life back into the Browns fans. The stadium was lit during the Second Half. That Second Half started a new era in Cleveland Football History. Mayfield was named a starter for Week 4 and beyond as expected. On his first start though Mayfield came back to earth against the Oakland Raiders.     Mayfield threw for two touchdowns but also had four turnovers which resulted in 21 Raiders points. Mayfield showed off his athletic skills, but also showed it was premature to make him a HOF player after that amazing second half in week 3. It is going to be interesting to see how the Browns and Mayfield will continue the rest of the way in all of a sudden new look AFC North that has Steelers tied at the bottom of the table instead of the top. #5 Sam Darnold, New York Jets (1-3)      Darnold was the only rookie quarterback who was named the starting quarterback prior to week 1. He had to earn the job in a battle with Teddy Bridgewater. Both Darnold and Bridgewater had a good preseason leading the Jets to trade Bridgewater to Saints and announce Darnold as a starter. Unlike other rookies, Darnold had an impressive start to his career. He completed 76% of his passes for 198 yards, 2 TDs and a pick with an impressive 116.8 rating. But after that, he came back crashing to earth. He had 4 more INTs to only 2 TDs in the remaining three games.         Darnold had his first career game without any interception in week 4 against a very good Jacksonville Jaguars defense. That should be considered a minor victory for a rookie QB who is struggling after a strong start. Unlike other quarterbacks, Darnold isn't surrounded by high flying talent. His receivers and the running backs are well below league average. In order to succeed long-term, the Jets need to provide weapons around him as the Bears did with Mitchell Trubisky this year, which helped him go off in week 4. Quincy Enunwa and the receivers need to step up and help the rookie QB to have any shot this year. Patriots, who had a slow start are getting back their groove right in time with Julian Edelman returning from his suspension. Jets will be facing a tough Denver defense in week 5. if Darnold could escape that game without a Turnover, they could have a very good chance to escape with a W. He could take some pointer from his veteran backup and mentor Josh McCown.     #4 Alex Smith, Washington Redskins (2-1)  Alex Smith has been his typical self to start the 2018 season with his new team the Washington Redskins. He has a completed nearly 70% of his passes and scored 4 Touchdowns with a pick and a 2-1 record. That is a typical Alex Smith stat line. Smith had a good start for his redskins tenure against the Cardinals, where he threw for 255 yards and a couple of TDs. But, in week 2 against a mediocre Colts defense Smith couldn't find the endzone even though completing nearly 72% of his passes. He and the Redskins bounced back in week 3 against the Packers where he outplayed Rodgers to upset the Packers.     Smith success correlates with the success of the running game. in the two wins, the Redskins new running back, Adrian Peterson rushed for nearly hundred yards and has scored a TD at least once, in the loss against the Colts he rushed 11 times for just 20 yards. Smith is one of those QBs who needs all the dominoes around him should work efficiently to find the success. He does not commit any back-breaking mistakes but he does not even get you out of the gate if fallen behind. NFC East is vulnerable right now and Redskins sit on top of the division even with their bye on week 4. The one difference between the Chiefs and the Redskins is that they lack that dynamic pass catcher that could help a QB out. Jordan Reed had some success in the wins but Jamison Crowder has yet to find the rhythm. It will be interesting to see if Smith can help out the Redskins to remain on top of a very close NFC East race as he did with the Chiefs the past few Seasons.     #3 Case Keenum, Denver Broncos (2-2)  Case Keenum, an undrafted free agent out of the University of Houston, had one of the most unprecedented journeys to become the starting quarterback of Denver Broncos. After his amazing career year in 2017 with the Vikings, Keenum signed a 2 year 36 million dollar contract with the Broncos. But, so far Keenum was not able to replicate the kind of success he had last season. Keenum had a total of 7 INTs in 2017 season has already thrown for 6 so far in four games and just tossing three touchdowns. Keenum's decision making at times seem erratic. He is trying to do more than what the defenses are giving him.     Even with his erratic play Keenum found some early success in the first two weeks by having two clutch game winning drives, which Broncos did not have last season. He almost had a third game winning drive on the MNF, week 4 against the Chiefs. He overthrew a wide open Demaryius Thomas which could have resulted in a game winning TD. In the next play he did connect to the rookie Courtland Sutton in an old-school hook and ladder play call.         Keenum, just like Smith is a game manager who needs to have a better player all around him. He has a solid running game with the two rookies, Royce Freeman and Phillip Lindsay sharing the work load, but the receivers apart from Emmanuel Sanders haven't really stepped up. The reason for having Keenum just a tick above the Last year with Vikings Keenum had Thielen and Diggs who had some amazing catches that helped out Keenum. Keenum knows that Demaryius Thomas is no longer in that elite group and need to be more careful forcing the ball into the tight coverage. The reason I have Keenum a tick above Alex Smith is that of his Clutch performance in weeks 1 and 2 and his NFC Championship game appearance just a few months back. I still think that Keenum is an upgrade to what Denver had last season and could help them have a fighting chance to at least grab the Wildcard spot in the playoffs.     There is no panic yet in Denver, there is a lot of season left and with no viable back up option left this will be Keenum's Season. If he can clean up the turnovers, this Denver team could be in hunt for a playoff spot in December. #2 Kirk Cousins, Minnesota Vikings (1-2-1)  Kirk Cousins, signed a monster contract with the Minnesota Vikings this offseason. After reaching the NFC Championship game a year ago with Keenum under center, the expectations very sky high for the Vikings fans. Some even considered this a Superbowl or bust move.     If indeed it is a Superbowl or bust move, the Vikings are off to a terrible start. They opened the season with a W against the 49ers but tied it up in week 2 with the Packers thanks to some head-scratching roughing the passer penalties. But the real stunner cam in Week 3 when Vikings and Cousins looked almost clueless against a bad Buffalo Bills team who scored a combined 23 points in the remaining three games. Cousins was shutout for three quarters, he had a couple of strip sacks an INT and it was late in the 4Q that he tossed a TD almost in garbage time. Apart from that one week, Cousins was his usual self he completed nearly 70% of his passes, tossing 10 Touchdowns and just 2 picks. He has 1,387 yards in just 4 games and yet the record is 1-2-1 record.         Cousins tenure so far remained same like his Redskins tenure where he played very well when was not pressured too much. But, when pressured his performance goes down. In 2018 so far his rating when the pocket is clean was 112.2, but when he is pressured it dramatically drops down to 89.8. Cousins even brought his fumbling issue from Redskins to Vikings, in which he is second most to fumble the ball since 2015. The Vikings O-line performance has been masked by Keenum's athleticism last season of avoiding the sacks, which Cousins clearly lacks. If Vikings need to find success with Cousins under center they need to provide a clean pocket and give him time to make the plays that Keenum couldn't have done last season. The NFC North looks very interesting with Chicago Bears on Top with Packer right next to them. If the Vikings need to be in the Playoffs in a very tough NFC they need to keep teh pocket clean for Cousins.     #1 Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs (4-0)  Patrick Mahomes is not a new player that was signed or added this offseason but he is the new starter for the Kansas City Chiefs after they traded Alex Smith to the Redskins. Mahomes did start in week 17 of last season but still, this is the first season as a full-fledged starter and thought he should be in this conversation. After the kind of start he had, he certainly should be.     Mahomes had one of the best starts since the Peyton Manning's record-breaking 2013 season. Mahomes even broke the Manning's record of 12 total touchdowns by tossing 13 through weeks 1-3. During the first three weeks, Mahomes was off to fast starts putting up 20+ points to start the game and make the opposing offenses play catchup to the Chiefs. The real test for Mahomes came in week 4 against a very good Broncos defense in a very rowdy Denver environment in Monday Night Prime-time slot. He had a slow start where Denver's defense had his number during the first three quarters. But he remained calm and made some timely passes in the fourth quarter resulting in one of the most thrilling matches in 2018 season so far.         The most amazing fact about Mahomes' performance so far in 2018 is that he has yet to throw an interception. In his four starts this season he has 15 touchdowns and zero picks. This INT-less streak should be attributed to his redshirt year in 2017 under Alex Smith. There is no better player to learn from how to remain interception-free. Mahomes performance so far is a reminiscence of Deshaun Watson's performance for Houston Texans last season. Mahomes is bound to be regressed in coming weeks, which could happen very well in week 5 against a very strong Jaguars defense, who allowed only a total of 4 touchdowns. The sky is the limit for Mahomes and this Kansas City offense. All they could ask for is the defense to play some average level play who currently are last in passing yards allowed. If the defense is not improved, a very good offensive season could very well be ruined come January. Mahomes, distanced himself from others atop of the MVP race, not a bad way to kickoff your first full season as a starting NFL QB. Let's hope the football gods spare Mahomes that bit the likes of Wentz and Watson last season during their own MVP campaigns.

He was 4-11 as a starter with the Carolina Panthers in 2020 and 5-1 over two years with the New Orleans Saints.   He may not have had the best preseason performance, but head coach Vic Fangio saw something in him that Drew Lock didn\'t. Von Miller may have seen the same thing now.        Teddy Bridgewater with a big debut for the @Broncos! 👏 pic.twitter.com/bHkYb91IFg— theScore (@theScore) September 12, 2021           The former Defensive Player of the Year and eight-time Pro Bowl LB has seen his fair share of heartbreaking seasons and inconsistent QBs: Tim Tebow, Kyle Orton, Trevor Siemian, Brock Osweiler, Paxton Lynch, Case Keenum, Joe Flacco, Brandon Allen, Jeff Driskel, Brett Rypien, Brandon Allen and Drew Lock.  There was the era of Peyton Manning from 2012 to 2015 where Von Miller played two Super Bowls and won one. Since Manning retired, it has been a rough going for the Broncos. With Teddy Bridgewater, it seems like things were still going to be the same.     Against the New York Giants in Week 1, Teddy Bridgewater went 28/36 (77.78%) for 264 yards and two TDs. I would say that was better than most people expected him to play, and he showed great accuracy on his intermediate throws.

Von Miller and Teddy Bridgewater had an intimate moment that was caught on tape on the sideline during the game. Miller told Teddy that he hadn\'t felt that way in a long time, since back when ""18 was here"".      The reference of 18 was Peyton Manning. Miller praised Teddy Bridgewater for his pep talks, and said they go a long way. His pep talks obviously worked well enough to get the win in Week 1.  It\'s also a huge positive for Teddy, as his leadership skills shine along with his abilities on the field. Vic Fangio may have made the right call after all by going with Teddy over Drew Lock. Teddy Bridgewater with another clutch throw on 4th down. pic.twitter.com/X5hOm7mkvi— Joe Rowles (@JoRo_NFL) September 12, 2021 If Teddy Bridgewater is able to keep this pace and his locker room in check, the Denver Broncos seem to have the roster to make the NFL playoffs as a sneaky good wildcard team.  Teddy Bridgewater will need to avoid turnovers that cost the team the victory and stay accurate with his throws, though. Hell, those Aaron Rodgers rumors of him joining the Denver Broncos could be over by the trade deadline at this rate. That was especially after how bad Aaron Rodgers was in Week 1 and how good Teddy Bridgewater fared during the same week.     ', ""Is Zach Wilson playing tonight vs Colts in Week 9?  Zach Wilson versus Mike White is the newest development in the Jets' decades-long search for a quarterback. Coming off the heels of an upset against the Cincinnati Bengals, fans are wondering whether Wilson's injury will allow White to get another shot.   Here's a look at the state of the Jets' quarterback room as the team counts down to tonight's clash against the Indianapolis Colts.        Will Zach Wilson play tonight against the Colts?           According to CBS Sports, Zach Wilson's PCL injury in his knee will keep the quarterback out of the lineup for tonight's game against the Indianapolis Colts. But by Week 10, the quarterback is expected to be ready to play against the Buffalo Bills. Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterIt’s another Mike White Day.3:29 AM · Nov 4, 2021236961249It’s another Mike White Day. https://t.co/Kv8DuXEEU7 The implications of this game could alter the course of the Jets franchise. If Mike White repeats his performance against the Cincinnati Bengals, the Jets will have to take a long look in the mirror.      At that point, Mike White will have earned more wins than Zach Wilson in two starts. Wilson had six starts and earned one win. Shaq Lawson@Shaq_Lawson90Mike white a real dawg.5:01 AM · Oct 31, 2021148281Mike white a real dawg. The Jets' entire plan could be in jeopardy of a massive retooling if Mike White has a repeat performance. The Jets will have to choose between riding with White and hurting Wilson's development or actively ending a hot streak for the young quarterback.  The NFL is a win-now league, and with a win tonight, many fans fear the Jets will choose to win now over Wilson's development.     The Jets' situation is not unlike Case Keenum's breakout season in 2017. That year, Keenum came in and went on a run that went all the way to the NFC Championship.  Will the Jets open themselves up to the possibility or will they shut it down for the sake of Wilson?     Of course, to get to that point, the Jets have to win tonight against the Colts. Carson Wentz is coming off a late-game unraveling against the Tennessee Titans in which he threw two critical interceptions.      The Colts are a team down on their luck, and if Wentz starts Week 9 like he ended Week 8, the Jets have a shot at winning. Tennessee Titans v Indianapolis ColtsThe Jets were able to upset the Cincinnati Bengals. By that logic, they can defeat the Indianapolis Colts. If they defeat the Colts under Mike White, Wilson's future becomes murky. Put simply, as far as mid-season Thursday Night Football games between two teams under .500 go, it doesn't get much better than this.     ""]"
69,Jacoby Brissett,"[""The Browns still have a major Jacoby Brissett problem following a close Week 1 win  Jacoby Brissett and the Cleveland Browns did the impossible on Sunday. They won a Week 1 game for the first time since 2004. Truth be told, rookie kicker Cade York was the hero, drilling a nearly 60-yard field goal for the win.  A win is a win, and the Browns are 1-0 for the first time in nearly two decades. So why should fans be wary heading into Week 2?         Brissett's play is the reason, and it will be a glaring problem until Deshaun Watson returns in Week 13.           The Browns won the game, and the quarterback never turned the ball over, so it's hard to say he was a complete failure. It was more of a C- performance if he needs a grade. The final numbers were 18/34 for 147 yards and a touchdown pass. He also scrambled for 10 yards on four carries. The touchdown pass was a one-yard toss to Kareem Hunt. This came after a terrible act of pass interference by a Carolina Panthers defender that wiped out an easy interception.  Again, touchdowns all count the same, but it was surely a gift the Panthers wanted back and are likely still regretting.        The best part of Brissett's day came on the final drive when he completed a few key passes. This was taking a shot to the head to get the team in field goal position for the win. Again, it was not all bad. However, it was not anything special by any measure. A key stat comes with Amari Cooper's final line. He finished with three receptions on six targets for only 17 yards. This is the number one receiver, and he was able to get open on multiple occasions. The difference between a top starter and a backup is that split-second decision-making to connect with a player the moment they get open. This was something Baker Mayfield struggled with last season. This is a major reason why he is now gone. For Brissett, no one is claiming he is a top-tier starter. Instead, he is a starting quarterback out of necessity. To his credit, he does possess experience in the league.     But the separation in talent is clear when it comes to him and a perennial starting talent. The Browns employ a run-heavy offense, and teams better than Carolina may force Kevin Stefanski's offense to pass more than they want.     Jacoby Brissett did the bare minimum to win Cleveland Browns v Carolina Panthers     Brissett lacks good mobility, which is more important in today's NFL than ever before. That can be game planned around, but it does take away the dynamic, big-play ability from those quarterbacks who can run at will and make a thrilling play.The Browns never acted like Brissett was a long-term option. But they are still carrying postseason expectations, and the season will be a failure if he continues to play as he did Sunday. Yet for now, fans can ignore any negatives and celebrate a rare Week 1 win.     "", ""Deshaun Watson delivers another subpar performance as Browns waste another season  The Cleveland Browns made arguably the most polarizing move of 2022 this past offseason by trading for and signing Deshaun Watson to a fully-guaranteed $230 million deal. This was supposed to take the team into a new stratosphere, where they are perennial contenders.  Yet the 11-game suspension handed down to the quarterback put those plans in jeopardy for the 2022 season. Jacoby Brissett did play admirably, however, and Watson returned with the Browns at 4-7. If he could return a hero and win out, the season would not be a waste. Instead, he had another rough performance Sunday as another season appears to be down the drain in Cleveland.                   Deshaun Watson failed to step up in Cincinnati Caesars Sportsbook@CaesarsSportsAnother Deshaun Watson interception 2213Another Deshaun Watson interception https://t.co/6SJPKFYWWq Watson and the Browns tried to sweep Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. Yet again, Watson was shaky and a horrific interception summed up his day in the 23-10 defeat to drop the team to 5-8 and realistically out of the playoff race. 26/42 for 276 yards and a touchdown is not terrible, but he did nothing to take his offense to the next level as he was signed to do.     Patient Browns fans will claim this was always part of the plan. The quarterback would return and use the final six games of the season to prepare for 2023.  The problem is that time moves quickly in the NFL. Players like Myles Garrett, Nick Chubb, Denzel Ward, and many others will be another year older next season. Primes are potentially being wasted when such a project is not necessary for the franchise. The $230 million man should indeed return in 2023 much better than he is now, given he will have a normal offseason of preparation. But will this roster be this stacked? The team is already without a first-round pick, and free agents may want to avoid Cleveland if they believe a coaching change is on the horizon. Jordan Zirm@JordanZirmBates read Watson’s eyes the whole way61Bates read Watson’s eyes the whole way https://t.co/IGejob3WWs     Patience, as a concept, is fine. However, all NFL fans know that organizations are impatient. While the Browns focus on being patient, teams like the Buffalo Bills, Kansas City Chiefs, Miami Dolphins, Cincinnati Bengals, and several others continue to improve. And that's just in the AFC.The Browns are falling behind and anything other than a dominant start from Watson to open the 2023 season may signal major changes coming in Cleveland. History could repeat itself very soon if the quarterback keeps playing as he did on Sunday.     "", ""Jacoby Brissett contract: How much will the former Browns QB earn with Commanders?  The Washington Commanders announced on Wednesday that they are signing quarterback Jacoby Brissett to a one-year deal worth $10 million.  The team lost quarterback Taylor Heinicke to free agency as he signed with the Atlanta Falcons and released quarterback Carson Wentz after just one season. Getting Brissett on board allows the Commanders to not overspend at quarterback.        Brissett was one of the best QBs available in the market after a good season with the Cleveland Browns. Although the team could not produce good results, it still saw their quarterback have some good individual performances. This was before Deshaun Watson took over following an 11-game suspension.           With the NFC East having Jalen Hurts and Dak Prescott as top quarterbacks, and the Philadelphia Eagles looking strong, Commanders had to find a stable veteran option. They, meanwhile, continue to search for long-term options. The new contract given by the Commanders includes $8 million in guaranteed money. Why are the Commanders signing Jacoby Brissett? Jacoby Brissett     He was a good quarterback last year, although the win-loss record doesn't back it up. He had some good performances while the Cleveland Browns' roster was not prepared to win games. Also, it was admirable to see him perform well even though he knew his stint as the starter would end. Brissett is not the kind of quarterback that will take you to the Super Bowl, but the Commanders are not contending anyway. The roster still needs more tools, and he's a quarterback with a low interception rate. He has played in 76 games before and has never thrown more than seven interceptions in a single season. Washington's idea is just to get the position stabilized as they study the quarterback's prospects. Will they move up in the draft to leapfrog other contenders for the position? Who knows. But they have a true chance of winning games with their new signing.The Commanders are not a team that would be a contender anyway, so at least they're making sure they don't give up on the season. A veteran quarterback is always the best option when you don't have anything for the long term yet, even though they have a lot of faith in Sam Howell.     "", ""Should the Dolphins sign Cam Newton? – NFL Rumors  The era of Tua Tagovailoa may be going on hiatus for the Miami Dolphins after Tagovailoa suffered a rib injury and was carted off the field. In his place, Jacoby Brissett stepped up and put together a rough performance, throwing for 169 yards and an interception en route to a Week Two loss. The performance sets a dark tone for the near future.  The Dolphins, a win-now organization in 2021, could be looking to the market for anyone who can give the team a boost to weather the injury. Luckily for them, Cam Newton is available just weeks after being cut in New England. Would Cam Newton be a good fit with the Dolphins?        Dolphins diving deep for Cam Newton?           The Patriots and the Dolphins are sworn enemies but the modern-day Dolphins are heavily influenced by the team. Their head coach, Brian Flores, was a position coach under Bill Belichick. The Dolphins' roster is also sprinkled with ex-Patriots, including Jacoby Brissett, Eric Rowe and Jason McCourty. If the Patriots have already permeated the team, why not sign another ex-Patriot? ChuckModi@ChuckModi1Cam Newton went 15-1 w/Ted Ginn as #1 WR and after 4 uneventful yrs w/Bears made Greg Olsen the first TE in NFL history to have 3 straight 1000 yard seasons.

If Cam were surrounded with level of talent Kirk Cousins has had in his career, he’d have a couple SB rings. The special advantage of signing Cam Newton is getting an inside scoop on the team. Of course, the Dolphins defeated the Patriots in Week 1, but the win was largely a result of Mac Jones' first start. He may be much different by the next time the two teams play. Anything the Dolphins can do to stay ahead of the Patriots should be done.     As an added bonus, by signing Cam Newton, the Dolphins would be keeping the Patriots from re-signing the quarterback if they change their minds. If something were to happen to Mac Jones, the Patriots would have no choice but to lean on Brian Hoyer. This would keep the Patriots down while keeping the Dolphins up.     The Dolphins are serious about the playoffs this season, so it makes sense to sign a quarterback who has plenty of playoff experience. It may have been a while for Cam Newton, but he has already shown he can perform in the playoffs. He knows how to deal with the pressure of the moment and can provide advice to Tagovailoa if he makes the playoffs.     Cam Newton after Super Bowl 50 between Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos Lastly, if the Dolphins somehow make the Super Bowl with Newton, they would have a quarterback who could deal with that pressure. He's already been there and, having lost one, his level of focus could elevate to a higher level. Needless to say, if Newton were to find himself in the Super Bowl again, he would dive on the fumble.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 3 TV Schedule     "", ""Tua Tagovailoa injury: when will Dolphins QB return?  The Dolphins are in the midst of a make-or-break season with Tua Tagovailoa, their supposed quarterback of the future. The Dolphins' biggest goal is to establish whether they can rely on Tua Tagovailoa long-term or if they need to go back to the drawing board at quarterback. Unfortunately, Tagovailoa's chances took a ding today as the second-year quarterback will miss Sunday with fractured ribs.  Tua Tagovailoa out for Sunday: Jacoby Brissett expected to start        It is unclear how long the injury will keep the quarterback out. He was listed as day-to-day after last Sunday's shutout loss to the Buffalo Bills. In his place will be Jacoby Brissett, who has a wealth of experience and played in Sunday's game as well.

Some would say the shock of the situation gives Brissett an excuse for the below-average quarterback performance. This week, many expect Brissett to have a better day against the Las Vegas Raiders.     Indianapolis Colts vs New Orleans Saints In his career, Brissett has 31 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. The backup quarterback is 12-20 in 32 games. He spent time with the New England Patriots, Indianapolis Colts, and now the Miami Dolphins. He's been on the field at least once every season since 2016, when he made his debut after Tom Brady's suspension and Jimmy Garoppolo's subsequent injury. Most recently, Brissett started 15 games in 2019 after the last-second retirement of starting quarterback Andrew Luck. In those games, Brissett threw for 18 touchdowns and six interceptions en route to a 7-8 record. He completed 60.9 percent of his passes and nearly eclipsed 3000 yards. The Dolphins will be hoping that this version of Brissett shows up for Sunday's game.        Tagovailoa has a long and storied history of injuries throughout his college career. He underwent multiple surgeries and failed to finish the season in 2019. The Dolphins are hoping Tagovailoa's latest injury will not consume the season. However, should Tagovailoa's injury become a long-term ordeal, the Dolphins are hoping Brissett can keep the ship afloat until Tagovailoa is fully healed.     "", ""3 observations from Tua Tagovailoa's big day against the Atlanta Falcons  Tua Tagovailoa has started to look more comfortable in the Miami Dolphins offense during the preseason. The Dolphins bounced back after their Week 1 loss to the Chicago Bears with a dominant performance against the Atlanta Falcons. All three of the quarterbacks that played for the Dolphins threw touchdown passes.  Jacoby Brissett completed all eight of his passes that he threw for 99 yards and a touchdown. Reid Sinnett completed the two passes he threw for seven yards and a touchdown. However, the talk of the game was Dolphins' second-year quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.        Here are three observations from Tua Tagovailoa's massive performance against the Atlanta Falcons.              Miami Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa looked terrific during the Week 2 win #1 Tua Tagovailoa's performance should ease the trade talks The Miami Dolphins are one of the few teams that are still interested in trading for Deshaun Watson. That trade package would most likely include their second-year quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Watson is an exceptional talent, but Tua proved he has what it takes in their second preseason game.

Tagovailoa completed eight of his eleven passes for 99 yards and an interception. The former Alabama quarterback demolished his Week 1 performance against the Falcons on Saturday. The Miami Dolphins gave Tua Tagovailoa a good amount of reps during their second preseason game. Tua completed sixteen of his twenty-three passes for 183 yards and a touchdown. The Dolphins quarterback may have done enough to silence the trade talks for a couple of months.      #2 Tua Tagovailoa still has more to prove, even with his excellent performance Even though Tua Tagovailoa had a big game against the Atlanta Falcons, Tagovailoa started the game completing all eight of his passes, but most of his completions were short throws. There's still more that he needs to prove. .@Tua has the @MiamiDolphins knocking on the door again. #ATLvsMIA pic.twitter.com/EcnPXgSvfj— NFL (@NFL) August 21, 2021 The Dolphins are still easing Tua into things, and unfortunately, that's limiting his potential. Tua still needs to prove that he can clean up his accuracy. He still shows some inconsistencies on short passes.     It will take more than a big game against the Falcons in the preseason for the Dolphins to be 100% sold on Tagovailoa.  #3 Tua Tagovailoa will need to lead the Dolphins to the playoffs in 2021 The Miami Dolphins have the 27th ranked strength of schedule heading into the upcoming season. Miami has added more weapons for Tua Tagovailoa to throw the football to this season. The former Alabama quarterback will enter the 2021 season in the same situation as Giants quarterback Daniel Jones.Tua Tagovailoa will have a tough road through the AFC East, especially after the improvements made by the New England Patriots and the Buffalo Bills looking good as well. Having the 27th ranked strength of schedule will make the 2021 season a playoff or bust season for Tua Tagovailoa.     "", 'Deshaun Watson Fantasy Outlook: Is the Browns QB starting Week 13?  Deshaun Watson will make his first appearance of the 2022 campaign against his old team, the Houston Texans, after being reinstated by the Cleveland Browns. According to statistics, Watson has consistently ranked among the top fantasy quarterbacks in NFL history.  Deshaun Watson hasn\'t participated in a league game in almost two years.

Watson can go up the priority list if he is still available and you need a QB. After being officially cleared on Monday, Watson will make his first appearance this Sunday. Given the circumstances and the fact that he hasn\'t featured since 2020, optimists should keep their hopes in check for his first match back. But as the season progresses, Watson might offer marginal QB1 value for fantasy.  Deshaun Watson\'s fantasy potential Deshaun Watson was performing at a high level the last time he played, but it\'s difficult to predict how he\'ll slot in with the Browns. Experienced backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett filled in for the Browns during Watson\'s 11-game suspension, but his performance was pedestrian. He has a 64.1% completion rate, 12 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.     Watson should be added to fantasy football rosters. However, it would be wise to wait until after his performance in his first match back before using him in the starting lineup. This season, the Texans have surprised many by playing well against quarterbacks. Only the Philadelphia Eagles and Denver Broncos have given up fewer points to quarterbacks than the Texans.

The quarterback position allows managers to add massive point totals to their final weekly scores as they are often the highest-scoring players in Fantasy Football. It's important to capitalize on this position to optimize weekly lineups.  The best way to get the most out of the quarterback position is by analyzing direct matchups and recent performances. This will help managers decide on the best options to start each week of the Fantasy Football season.         Week 11 will present four fewer choices as four teams are currently in their bye weeks. This includes the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Miami Dolphins, and the Seattle Seahawks.               Tom Brady, Trevor Lawrence, Tua Tagovailoa, and Geno Smith will be unavailable this week as they are in their bye weeks. This will cause many Fantasy Football managers to seek replacements on their rosters. They may rely on these players as starters during most weeks but will need to strategize accordingly in Week 11.

Yet the 13-3 victory did not exactly feature a legendary performance from the quarterback. He finished 18/28 for 161 yards and threw for the only touchdown in the game. The defense was the reason the Browns cruised to victory, which is a rare fact to type out this season.        Cleveland is now 2-1 with Watson under center.

Yet the weather was freezing, and most importantly, he did not turn the ball over like he did in his first two games back. Just getting wins will endear him to the fanbase at this point. The problem is that below-average performances from him could mean another losing record if this carries over into 2023. Jacoby Brissett provided admirable quarterback play in the first 11 games of the year, and because of defensive woes, the team had a 4-7 record.     If the defense does not improve, Watson may have to play at a Pro Bowl level just to have the Browns in contention in the division. And that is assuming a return to that level of play is still possible for him after his long absence. The 11-game suspension meant the entire organization began focusing on 2023, with 2022 as an evaluation period for the entire roster.

It was an impressive display that raised the question of how often quarterbacks lead their teams to playoff wins in their debut seasons.  While many have led their teams to the playoffs, only a select few have managed to achieve the feat of winning a playoff game in their first season. Here is a list of 5 quarterbacks to have won a playoff game in their rookie season.                   #1. Ben Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh Steelers (2004 season)  AFC Wild Card Playoffs - Former Pittsburgh Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Ben Roethlisberger in the first round of the 2004 NFL draft. Initially, he was the third-choice quarterback on the team behind Tommy Maddox and Charlie Batch. However, due to an injury to Batch during the preseason (and poor performances) and an injury to Maddox in Week 3, Roethlisberger was given an opportunity.

He made his playoff debut in the Divisional round against the New York Jets and helped lead the team to victory in overtime with a game-winning field goal. The Steelers lost the AFC championship game to eventual Super Bowl champions the New England Patriots. #2. Joe Flacco, Baltimore Ravens (2008 season)  New York Jets Joe Flacco     The Baltimore Ravens selected Joe Flacco as the 18th overall pick in 2008 NFL draft. Flacco was meant to be the third-choice quarterback, but due to injuries to starter Kyle Boller and an illness to Tro Smit, Flacco was given the nod. Flacco finished his rookie season with a pass completion percentage of 60.0%, 2,971 yards, and 16 touchdowns. Flacco and the Ravens secured their place in the playoffs and defeated the Miami Dolphins 27-9 in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. Flacco became the first quarterback to win two consecutive playoff games in their rookie season after a 13-10 divisional-round victory over the Tennessee Titans. The Ravens lost the AFC championship game against the Steelers 14-23. #3. Mark Sanchez, New York Jets (2009 season)  Jacksonville Jaguars v New York Jets     Mark Sanchez was taken in the first round of the 2009 NFL draft. The New York Jets traded their first- and second-round selections, as well as three players, to the Cleveland Browns to take him fifth overall. The 2009 season began on a high note for Sanchez, winning three consecutive Pepsi Rookie of the Week awards in the first three weeks of the campaign.

In Week 4, Sanchez threw an interception that led to a 99-yard touchdown. In Week 6, he threw five interceptions in a 16-13 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Sanchez and the Jets rallied to finish the regular season with a 9-7 record, securing a spot in the playoffs. In the Wild Card round, they secured a 24-14 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. Sanchez and the team went on to win the Divisional round game against the San Diego Chargers 17-14. Sanchez became the second rookie quarterback in NFL history to win his first two consecutive playoff games following Joe Flacco in 2008. Despite their success, the Jets eventually lost their AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts with a score of 30-17, giving up an 11-point lead. #4. Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks (2012 season) Russell Wilson - St. Louis Rams v Seattle Seahawks, 2012     Russell Wilson was selected by the Seahawks as the 75th overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft. After competing for the starter position with veteran quarterback Matt Flynn and Tarvaris Jackson, Wilson was given the nod for the 2021 season. Wilson threw for 3,118 yards and 26 touchdowns in his rookie season, tying the record set by Peyton Manning for most touchdown passes by a rookie. Wilson's ability as a running quarterback contributed to 489 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. Led by Wilson, the Seahawks secured a playoff spot and went on to win their wild-card round game against the Washington Redskins by a score of 24-14. Wilson had a solid performance, throwing for 187 yards and rushing for 67 yards. They would eventually lose the divisional round game against the Atlanta Falcons by a field goal with 31 seconds left on the clock. #5.

After injuries to initial starters Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo, Purdy was given the nod to start in Week 13. To the amazement of many, Purdy put up impressive numbers, throwing for 1,374 yards and 14 total touchdowns in five games as the 49ers starting quarterback. The 49ers met the Seahawks in the Wild Card game of the playoffs and won 41-23.Purdy threw for 332 yards and three passing touchdowns, as well as scoring a rushing touchdown.

71,Trevor Siemian,"[""Who is Trevor Siemian? NFL star's electrifying performance for Bears in preseason gets fans talking  Trevor Siemian is the backup quarterback for the Chicago Bears. He was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the seventh round of the 2015 NFL Draft. He was the backup to Peyton Manning in SuperBowl 50, where they won by a score of 24-10 over the Carolina Panthers.  In his four years at Northwestern University, he totaled just 27 passing touchdowns with 24 interceptions and rushed for -23 yards. Siemian has mostly been a reliable backup option for teams around the league after the 2016 season in which he was the starter for the Broncos. In his three years at Denver, he played 26 games, throwing 30 touchdowns and 24 interceptions for 5,686 yards.        He played 11 games in the 2017 season, after which he was traded to the Minnesota Vikings to be the backup for Kirk Cousins. Since then, he has been on the roster for the New York Jets, Tennessee Titans and New Orleans Saints. In 2022 he signed a two-year contract with the Chicago Bears and played in the team's first preseason game.           He impressed the fans after a solid performance, delivering 7-of-13 for 89 yards with two touchdowns and a 115.1 passer rating. Here are some of the tweets praising the quarterback: Jarrett Payton@paytonsunTrevor Siemian showing the touch on the throw and a good understanding of this offense. #Bears1448Trevor Siemian showing the touch on the throw and a good understanding of this offense. #Bears     Herb Howard@HerbHoward411#Bears backup QB Trevor Siemian is a very accurate passer.205#Bears backup QB Trevor Siemian is a very accurate passer.

In 33 career games with them, he recorded 57 receptions for 598 yards and four touchdowns. He suffered several injuries during his first three years and was finally traded to the Bears in 2022.        On the first play of training camp, he suffered an ankle injury after a collision with linebacker Nicholas Marrow. He underwent surgery on Thursday, August 11 and is expected to be out for nearly eight weeks. In Chicago, he joined a receiving corps consisting of Darnell Mooney, Byron Pringle and Equanimeous St. Brown. Harry is an explosive player with a knack for catching the ball in traffic and making big plays. Upon returning to full health, he will undoubtedly be a huge boost for the team's offense.We will see Siemian in action throughout the preseason and Harry in the regular season once he has recovered from injury.

Some teams are facing difficult battles for one reason or another. Factoring in the situations that their teams are facing, these five players need to step up in Week 9 and have a big performance.          #1 - RB Aaron Jones, Green Bay Packers           Aaron Rodgers has officially been ruled out for the Green Bay Packers' Week 9 game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Jordan Love will make his first start.  An effective running game is going to be crucial to helping out the inexperienced quarterback, especially against a weak Chiefs defense.

This is a massive loss. They recently signed veteran Adrian Peterson to replace him, but Jeremy McNichols will get the start this week. He has an opportunity to prove his value and possibly even dictate the split of carries between him and Peterson moving forward.     #3 - WR Bryan Edwards, Las Vegas Raiders The Las Vegas Raiders released Henry Ruggs ahead of Week 9 after his reckless involvement in a car accident. Ruggs led the team in receiving yards while ranking third in both targets and receptions. Bryan Edwards has been solid with his limited touches this season. Now he is going to have to step up and play a larger role in Week 9. #4 - QB Trevor Siemian, New Orleans Saints The New Orleans Saints are on an active three-game winning streak, including an upset over their division rivals, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They will try to keep it rolling in Week 9 but will have to do so without quarterback Jameis Winston. Winston is out for the season with an injury, so Trevor Siemian will get an opportunity to start. A strong performance in Week 9 could win him the job moving forward.

"", 'Zach Wilson should never start again after Mike White leads the Jets to victory  The New York Jets looked ready to implode just a week ago after an embarrassing 10-3 loss against the New England Patriots. The team entered the day with a 6-3 record and was coming off a bye. Yet somehow, Zach Wilson looked worse than ever.  He finished with a subpar 9/22 for 77 yards. Things were so ugly that the coaching staff decided to bench him in favor of backup Mike White.        So how did that turn out? Well, it looks like White has earned the job for the remainder of the season. That is if the Jets are serious about making the postseason.            Mike White got the Jets back on track White and the Jets were given a break when the Chicago Bears ruled Justin Fields out with an injury. That left Trevor Siemian as the starter. But White still had to take it to the Chicago defense, which he did with ease. He finished 22/28 for 315 yards and three touchdowns. He carved up the Chicago defense and made it clear that this Jets team is capable of great things if they have competent play at quarterback. For reference, Wilson, a former No. 2 overall pick, has four passing touchdowns all season. NFL on CBS 🏈@NFLonCBSMike White has 3 Pass TD todayZach Wilson has NEVER thrown 3 Pass TD in a game in his career2724311Mike White has 3 Pass TD todayZach Wilson has NEVER thrown 3 Pass TD in a game in his career https://t.co/g2EMc6q0Fo     Fans in New York will remember that White has shown his abilities before, most notably in 2021 when he threw for 405 yards in a shocking win over the Cincinnati Bengals. Yet his chance ended a few weeks later when he tossed four interceptions against the Buffalo Bills. Any quarterback is capable of lighting it up one week, only to engineer an epic collapse the next. Yet one thing remains true: the team cannot go back to Wilson, even if that means inserting Joe Flacco if things go south for White. This is an awkward situation as the team drafted Wilson at No. 2 overall in 2021. But his performance against the Patriots was simply too demoralizing. White stepped in a week later and suddenly, the offense was thriving. Both Garrett Wilson and Elijah Moore looked like stars, combining for three touchdowns against the Bears. Richard Sherman@RSherman_25With Mike White everybody eats B! Elijah Moore welcome back!https://t.co/FYYlJy1ir1 twitter.com/i/web/status/1…56362With Mike White everybody eats B! Elijah Moore welcome back!https://t.co/FYYlJy1ir1 twitter.com/i/web/status/1…Wilson is far too limited, at least at this point in time, to lead a team into the postseason.

Although the chances are slim, there is still a possibility with three games remaining on their schedule.  The Dolphins will head to New Orleans on Monday night to face rookie quarterback Ian Book, who was drafted by the Saints out of Notre Dame this past spring.        The Saints have had their hands full this season with a revolving door of quarterback changes. After the retirement of quarterback Drew Brees, Jameis Winston was named the starter at the beginning of the 2021 NFL season.           Winston tore his ACL against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Halloween, which led to the Saints turning to Trevor Siemian. After his poor performance he was replaced by the Saints' Swiss Army knife in Taysom Hill, who had just come back from a foot injury. As with the entire sports world, COVID-19 has taken a hit on the Saints, especially within their quarterback room. It has now left the Saints with a rookie to start for them. The Saints are 7-7 this season, and with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers clinching the NFC South on Sunday, their only chance at making the playoffs is through a Wild Card spot.

The Carolina Panthers are taking on the Denver Broncos, but what you might notice is that Baker Mayfield isn't the starting quarterback. The former Cleveland Browns QB has had an up-and-down start to his life with the Panthers and it hasn't taken long for him to be benched.  Many thought Mayfield's acquisition would present a change in fortunes for the NFC franchise, but it hasn't worked out that may. The 27-year-old is a poor 1-5 on the season, forcing interim head coach Steve Wilks' hand to give Sam Darnold a start over Mayfield.

But Panthers fans probably don't see it that way. Likely, they just just to win.  Panthers begin life without Baker Mayfield against the Broncos Sam Darnold - Carolina Panthers v Baltimore Ravens     Both the Panthers and the Broncos come into the Week 12 clash with only three wins each. It is not exactly the way they were hoping their season was going to go. For the Panthers, they simply can't get settled at the quarterback position. P.J. Walker Jacob Eason and Mayfield have all tried their hand, but have had zero success.    Now it's Darnold's turn to try and salvage something from the season. Carolina only averages 18 points a game (ranks 25th in the league) while they give up 23 points per game on average (ranks 19th).     The Panthers could only manage three points against the Baltimore Ravens last Sunday and that proved to be the final straw as Darnold was handed his first start of the season. Josh Graham@JoshGrahamRadioI’ll give Baker Mayfield this: he’s not just standing around on the sideline as a backup.He’s been engaged behind the bench — likely watching some all-22 video of the last offensive drive — and been in Sam Darnold’s ear helping him out.#KeepPounding5I’ll give Baker Mayfield this: he’s not just standing around on the sideline as a backup.He’s been engaged behind the bench — likely watching some all-22 video of the last offensive drive — and been in Sam Darnold’s ear helping him out.#KeepPounding https://t.co/Kzv7fqhGSW Whether or not the quarterback change will translate into a better offensive production is not yet known. However, the Panthers have had enough of what is currently being produced.If Darnold can put his best foot forward, then perhaps the starting job will be his for the foreeseeable future. In a game where he really is playing for his NFL career, it will be interesting to see how he gets on. All Baker Mayfield can do is watch from the sidelines.     "", 'Russell Wilson trade rumors: NFL analyst drops massive trade hint\xa0  Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks\' 2021-22 season is not going the way they expected at the start of the campaign. In fact, this is the first time the Seahawks will finish with a losing record in Wilson’s storied 10-year career in Seattle. The Seahawks suffered a 20-10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams on Tuesday in what was a below-par performance from Seattle\'s offense.  The defeat to the Rams dropped the Seahawks to 5-9 and ended their hopes of making it to the NFL playoffs this season. A finger injury forced him to miss three games but many felt the quarterback rushed his return, resulting in below-par performances. Per multiple reports over the last two weeks, the 33-year-old quarterback is expected to make a move to a Super Bowl contender in 2022.                   Russell Wilson trade on the cards in 2022 Wilson was reportedly open to a trade last offseason, but he later denied the claims and stayed in Seattle. He said: ""There was a lot of people, there was a whole thing saying I requested a trade, and that\'s just not true. I didn\'t request a trade. Everything kind of started from there. Obviously, tons of teams were calling and I think that the reality was I didn\'t want to go anywhere else, I wanted to play in Seattle. But if I had to go somewhere, these are the teams I would go to or consider. At the end of the day I have a no-trade clause, right?""

In the latest episode of ESPN\'s Get Up, NFL analyst Mike Tannenbaum revealed the one NFC team that will suit Wilson best next year. He explained: ""It\'s the New Orleans Saints and the day he walks in that building. They are instant Super Bowl contenders. And here\'s why. They\'re going to get back Michael Thomas. They have Alvin Kamara. We\'ve already seen Greeny over the last two years. They have a championship defense. Just go ask Tom Brady. So you bring in Russell Wilson with that nucleus. They are in the Super Bowl conversation. ""        The deal could work wonders for both the Saints and Seahawks. New Orleans eye a considerable upgrade at quarterback, while the Seahawks are in desperate need of some first-round draft picks. To get the most value for Wilson, the Seahawks will look to trade him with a few years remaining on his deal rather than next offseason as his contract runs through 2023.

It is a notoriously difficult place to fill at the best of times, but it is especially difficult when someone is trying to replace an all-time great like Peyton Manning.  We take a look at every starter who has played for the Denver Broncos in that position since Peyton Manning's retirement. As this has been such an unstable position for the franchise after Peyton Manning, in most seasons, they have had multiple starters in the given position. So, for the purposes of clarity, only those who started most games are listed at the top and others who played in those seasons are mentioned separately.                       Denver Broncos quarterbacks since Peyton Manning retired 2016 and 2017 - Trevor Siemian Right after Peyton Manning retired, Brock Osweiler, who had started some of the games the previous year with Peyton Manning in their Super Bowl-winning season, left for the Houston Texans to become their starter. That opened up the field for third-choice Trevor Siemian to compete with rookie Paxton Lynch and veteran Mark Sanchez, and Siemian eventually became the starter.     James Palmer@JamesPalmerTVTrevor Siemian is the only QB with a winning record for the #Broncos since Peyton Manning retired entering the 2016 seasonTrevor Siemian (13-11), Case Keenum (6-10), Paxton Lynch (1-3), Joe Flacco (0-4) and Brock Osweiler (0-4)35588Trevor Siemian is the only QB with a winning record for the #Broncos since Peyton Manning retired entering the 2016 seasonTrevor Siemian (13-11), Case Keenum (6-10), Paxton Lynch (1-3), Joe Flacco (0-4) and Brock Osweiler (0-4) In 2016, he played 14 of 16 games for the Denver Broncos (the last two weeks were quarterbacked by Paxton Lynch) and established himself as the first choice. Even though the Broncos missed the playoffs, he finished with a passer rating of 84.6 that was higher than Peyton Manning and Brock Osweiler from the previous season. Over the last six weeks of his season from Weeks 8 to 14, he averaged more than 300 yards, behind only Tom Brady and Kirk Cousins. He was named a Pro Bowl alternate but did not accept the invitation due to the shoulder surgery he went ahead with after Week 14.        In 2017, now firmly established as a starter but under new coach Vance Joseph, he began the season strongly, and the high point was a game against the Dallas Cowboys where he threw four touchdowns. In Week 6, he suffered a shoulder injury. Then, over the next few weeks, his production declined. He was benched in favor of the returning Brock Osweiler in Week 9, who was himself then relieved by Paxton Lynch in Week 12. After Lynch was injured in that game, Siemian got another chance to lead the Broncos. But another shoulder injury in Week 15 spelled the end of his career with the Broncos as Brock Osweiler relieved him in that game and started in Week 16.     2018 - Case Keenum After the upheaval of the previous season, when the Broncos had three quarterbacks trading places, head coach Vance Joseph chose to reunite with former Houston Texans quarterback Case Keenum, who they traded from the Minnesota Vikings. They stuck with him throughout the season and he started all 16 games as the Broncos went 6-10.    He threw for 3,890 yards with a 62.3 completion rate. He had 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, with a 81.2 passer rating. He was traded to the Washington Redskins for a seventh-round pick in 2019.     2019 - Joe Flacco In 2019, the Denver Broncos decided to go with Joe Flacco, who had won one Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens. There were eerie parallels with Peyton Manning as they plumped for a veteran quarterback and former Super Bowl MVP. He was named the starter and had the job until he faced a neck injury in Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts. In those eight games that he started, he had 1,822 passing yards, six touchdowns, five interceptions, and an 85.1 passer rating. He was subsequently released by the Broncos and went on to sign with the New York Jets, where he still is currently.        After Joe Flacco was injured, he was replaced by Brandon Allen for three games before Drew Lock stepped in for the final five games of the season. The rookie quarterback finished with 1,020 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions in those five games and equalled John Elway's franchise record for most wins by a rookie in Broncos history. His four wins came in just five games compared to the 10 taken by Elway. Peter Baugh@Peter_BaughDrew Lock's rookie year stats for the #Broncos: •5 games played •1,020 yards (204 a game)•7 TD•3 interceptions •4-1 record776Drew Lock's rookie year stats for the #Broncos: •5 games played •1,020 yards (204 a game)•7 TD•3 interceptions •4-1 record 2020 - Drew Lock For his performances the previous season, Lock was named the starter for 2020. In Week 2, he injured his shoulder and would not return until Week 6. During that period, Jeff Driskel and Brett Rypien started one game each. In Week 12, due to a COVID outbreak among the quarterback corps, running back Phillip Lindsay started under center.     Lock's performances in his second season were not up to standard. Case in point, he had 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. This was the joint highest in the league , tied with Carson Wentz, despite Lock only playing 13 matches. His 57.3 completion rate was the lowest among all quarterbacks with, at least, 150 passing attempts that season.    2021 - Teddy Bridgewater In 2021, Teddy Bridgewater, the 2015 Pro Bowler, joined the team from the Carolina Panthers. He beat out Drew Lock to become the starter, though Lock started three games in each of which Bridgewater was out injured. In the 13 games that he started, he threw for 3,052 yards, 18 touchdowns, and seven interceptions for a passer rating of 94.9 with a 66.9 completion percentage. At the end of the season, he was traded to the Miami Dolphins as the Denver Broncos acquired Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks.     2022 - Russell Wilson   Russell Wilson joined from the Seattle Seahawks. In a deal that sent Drew Lock to Seattle, along with other players and draft picks, the future hall-of-famer joined the Denver Broncos for a five-year, $245 million deal. The Broncos will hope to replicate the success they had with Peyton Manning when they last had a future hall-of-famer as their quarterback.     ""]"
72,Jeff Driskel,"[""Who is Jeff Driskel? All about the Texans' QB  Jeff Driskel is an American football player that plays the quarterback position for the Houston Texans. Since joining the league as the 207th pick of the 2018 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, Driskel has been a backup QB.  He has appeared for four franchises: the Cincinnati Bengals, Detroit Lions, Denver Broncos, and the Houston Texans. Driskel has proven to be a reliable option when called upon. He usually comes up when needed by his coaches, especially during garbage time or in the case of an injury to the starting QB.        The Los Angeles Tech alum has earned plaudits amongst coaches for being a consummate professional, even when he doesn't start games. That attitude has served him well, as he has played in 18 regular-season games since being drafted and has put up decent stats in the process.                   View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post  What is Jeff Driskel's role in the NFL? The 2022 NFL season began with Jeff Driskel signing a contract as the backup quarterback for the Houston Texans. The Texans have a Deshaun Watson-sized hole at QB; one that surely isn't going to be filled by a sixth-round quarterback with no playoff experience. As such, Driskel has been made to be content with the backup role.     Driskel took to the Gridiron for only the third time this season when he completed four of his six passes for 38 yards and a touchdown in a close 27-23 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. That touchdown pass was his first of the year, and it sees him keep up his record of throwing at least one touchdown pass a year since being drafted.  How is Jeff Driskel performing this season? This season, Driskel has put up a stat line of 38 passing yards, one touchdown, and zero interceptions in three games off the bench. However, it is worth mentioning that if Driskel wants to play for minutes in a good NFL franchise, he has a long way to go in Houston or on another team.At 29 years old, he has the experience and is still just young enough to work his way up and establish a reputation as a Jimmy Garoppolo-type backup QB.     "", 'Von Miller praises Teddy Bridgewater for leadership after Week 1 win  Many were wary about Teddy Bridgewater being named the starting QB for the Denver Broncos this season. He was 4-11 as a starter with the Carolina Panthers in 2020 and 5-1 over two years with the New Orleans Saints.   He may not have had the best preseason performance, but head coach Vic Fangio saw something in him that Drew Lock didn\'t. Von Miller may have seen the same thing now.

There was the era of Peyton Manning from 2012 to 2015 where Von Miller played two Super Bowls and won one. Since Manning retired, it has been a rough going for the Broncos. With Teddy Bridgewater, it seems like things were still going to be the same.     Against the New York Giants in Week 1, Teddy Bridgewater went 28/36 (77.78%) for 264 yards and two TDs. I would say that was better than most people expected him to play, and he showed great accuracy on his intermediate throws.

Von Miller and Teddy Bridgewater had an intimate moment that was caught on tape on the sideline during the game. Miller told Teddy that he hadn\'t felt that way in a long time, since back when ""18 was here"".      The reference of 18 was Peyton Manning. Miller praised Teddy Bridgewater for his pep talks, and said they go a long way. His pep talks obviously worked well enough to get the win in Week 1.  It\'s also a huge positive for Teddy, as his leadership skills shine along with his abilities on the field. Vic Fangio may have made the right call after all by going with Teddy over Drew Lock.

Teddy Bridgewater will need to avoid turnovers that cost the team the victory and stay accurate with his throws, though. Hell, those Aaron Rodgers rumors of him joining the Denver Broncos could be over by the trade deadline at this rate. That was especially after how bad Aaron Rodgers was in Week 1 and how good Teddy Bridgewater fared during the same week.     ', ""3 observations from the Houston Texans-Dallas Cowboys preseason matchup  The Dallas Cowboys are still searching for their first win of the preseason after a disappointing loss to the Houston Texans Saturday night. Jerry Jones' boys have one more shot against the Jacksonville Jaguars next week, and that game has now become more critical.  Unlike the Cowboys, the Houston Texans are heading into their preseason finale undefeated. With everything the Texans have gone through this offseason, finishing their preseason undefeated will be a massive win. The Texans may not be a dumpster fire after all.        Here are three observations from the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans' Week 2 preseason matchup.            Houston Texans rookie QB Davis Mills has shined during the preseason #1 Houston Texans starting QB job looks to belong to Davis Mills The Houston Texans entered their offseason with a massive question mark next to their quarterback position. One thing that was for sure in Houston was that Deshaun Watson wouldn't be playing. That left the Houston Texans with Davis Mills, Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel.     All three of Davis Mills' longest completions tonight are play-action strikes. pic.twitter.com/OpTTA9LAeo— Rivers McCown (@riversmccown) August 22, 2021 Davis Mills has outperformed both Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel over the last two preseason games. Mills completed 11 of his 22 passes for 112 yards and an interception against the Packers in Week 1. He followed that above-average performance by completing ten of his sixteen passes for 115 yards against the Cowboys. It looks like Davis Mills will head into Week 1 of the regular season as the starting quarterback in Houston. That's if a miracle doesn't happen and Deshaun Watson suddenly changes his mind.      #2 Dallas Cowboys are still searching for Dak Prescott's backup The Dallas Cowboys headed into their preseason matchup with the Houston Texans with three quarterbacks battling for one job. That job is backing up their franchise quarterback Dak Prescott. Garrett Gilbert, Cooper Rush and Ben DiNucci are all fighting for the backup role. COWBOYS GAME REPLAY 🎬: Cooper Rush connects with Cedrick Wilson for the go ahead TD! ✭ #dallascowboys pic.twitter.com/Sb0K4UbAuG— The Cowboys Network (@TheCowboysNet) August 22, 2021 After the Hall of Fame Game, it looked like Garrett Gilbert would run away with the job. Cooper Rush bounced back against the Cardinals to prove he's not out of the race just yet. Ben DiNucci led the Cowboys in passing yards against the Texans, but he threw three interceptions.     With the Cowboys' preseason finale approaching quickly, Josh Rosen is starting to look even better. All three quarterbacks have had good and bad performances, making the Cowboys' backup quarterback spot an open race heading into their finale against Jacksonville.  #3 Dallas Cowboys haven't scored a rushing touchdown during the preseason The Dallas Cowboys fan base has been focused on the quarterback position and their defense. That has taken the attention away from their rushing attack. Dallas hasn't recorded a rushing touchdown in its three preseason games. Ezekiel Elliott hasn't appeared in any of the Cowboys' preseason games, but that doesn't take away their struggles. The Cowboys need their run game if they want Dak to have a successful season. With one preseason game left, the Cowboys will need their run game to find the end zone to build momentum heading into the upcoming season.Also Check Out: Complete Dallas Cowboys NFL Preseason Schedule 2021     "", 'Stafford\'s start streak to end at 136 games due to back injury    Matthew Stafford will miss an NFL game for the first time since 2010, with a back injury ruling him out of the Detroit Lions\' clash with the Chicago Bears.        Lions quarterback Stafford had started the previous 136 games, which was longest active streak among players at his position. Multiple reports said Stafford will not play against the Bears at Chicago\'s Soldier Field due to broken bones in his back, with Jeff Driskel set to start in his place. Stafford\'s wife, Kelly, confirmed his absence on her Instagram story. She wrote: ""[Heartbroken emoji] for this as well.

""I\'m incredibly proud to be his wife, he\'s the toughest SOB... but I\'m happy his body will get a little healing time.""Stafford has been enjoying an excellent season, throwing for 2,499 yards and 19 touchdowns with just five interceptions.His performances have not translated into consistent results for the Lions, however. Detroit head into the game with Chicago 3-4-1, with their hopes of reaching the playoffs in a hugely competitive NFC looking slim.

The Patriots (2-2) saw several key players test positive for COVID-19 in recent weeks, including starting quarterback Cam Newton and star cornerback Stephon Gilmore, a.k.a. the former league MVP and reigning Defensive Player of the Year.        Earlier this week, the Broncos (1-3) suffered a potential setback when starting running back Melvin Gordon was cited for driving under the influence (DUI).

Denver Broncos vs New England Patriots Head to Head The Denver Broncos and New England Patriots have met each other 53 times in the past. Denver currently has a big lead in the series with a 30-23 record. The teams last faced each other in 2017, when the Patriots won at Denver in easy fashion, 41-16. But that was, of course, during the Tom Brady era. Despite the familiar face of coach Bill Belichick on the New England sideline, this is a very different Patriots team.

While they currently sit at second place in the AFC East, the team clearly did not perform well with Newton sidelined. Numbers may not do justice for what Newton has been doing, considering he has been out of football for quite some time prior. The fact that several teams passed on Newton in the offseason also must be fueling his hunger to perform well. Having another hurdle thrown his way due to COVID must be further pushing him to light the Broncos defense on fire.     As for the Broncos, they are already hurting severely on both sides of the ball. While Rypien played alright with the time he had, the Broncos still have to see if Lock is the future of this team. For now, the organization is behind Lock until further notice.Prediction: Patriots win in an effort led by Newton.Also Check Out: Cam Newton’s Best Outfits     "", '3 reasons why NFL teams should sign Colin Kaepernick after Michigan spring game display  Can Colin Kaepernick help a franchise win?  As the 2022 NFL season approaches, this question, which comes with plenty of strings attached, keeps re-emerging.        Of course, given his status as a former second-round draft pick that later took over the reigns from Alex Smith in his second season and helped lead the San Franscisco 49ers to Super Bowl XLVII, the question isn\'t solely about talent.           On the road to Super Bowl XLVII, Colin Kaepernick outdueled Aaron Rodgers in the 2012 postseason and then helped lead a late comeback in the NFC Championship game against an Atlanta Falcons squad that had a 396-yard passing performance from Matt Ryan.        Colin Kaepernick later eclipsed 4,000 total yards in 2014 with his arm and his feet. Talent isn\'t the issue. Everything related to his off-field spat with the former President of the United States and his kneeling-for-the-flag stance has been seen as such, though. Keep in mind, though, that was 2016. In the years that have followed, Colin Kaepernick suffered from his controversial viewpoints. That still shouldn\'t be the case in 2022.  Why NFL teams should sign Colin Kaepernick after Michigan spring game display  #1 - Colin Kaepernick still has a strong arm Anyone saying that Colin Kaepernick didn\'t look impressive in his limited time throwing the ball in front of scouts probably had their minds made up before he made a single throw. Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterColin Kaepernick’s final pass today today at Michigan’s Maize and Blue Spring Game. @BigTenNetwork3:44 AM · Apr 2, 2022383932965Colin Kaepernick’s final pass today today at Michigan’s Maize and Blue Spring Game.📹 @BigTenNetwork https://t.co/y9pvu3iGZC     While, yes, there were no defenders pursuing him and he didn\'t have any pads or helmet on, Colin Kaepernick showed that he can still air it out with accuracy at ""The Big House"" in Ann Arbor. If his lateral speed hasn\'t waned in the years since he last suited up for an NFL team, Kaepernick could still be a lethal threat, both in the pocket and scrambling out of it.    Clearly, time away from the field has not made him any less of a deep-threat in the passing game.     #2 - There are not 32 better backups out there When Colin Kaepernick wanted to start for an NFL team, it was more understandable why he wasn\'t being employed. His 2016 stats (his last active season) were far from terrible. With that said, 18 touchdowns and 17 turnovers wasn\'t exactly starter material at the time. It certainly makes it even more difficult to stomach considering five NFL seasons have been completed since and not one of them saw Kaepernick step foot on the field. But since that stance has changed this time around, it\'s getting tough to justify not giving him a flyer. B/R Gridiron@brgridironColin Kaepernick is open to accepting a back up QB role, per @JosinaAnderson6:30 AM · Apr 1, 202216014862Colin Kaepernick is open to accepting a back up QB role, per @JosinaAnderson https://t.co/Ekf1f8Q0JV     Colin Kaepernick understands that there may not be a coach out there willing to take a steep leap of faith in handing him the starting job. That hasn\'t stopped him from still working to earn one, though, should he ever receive his shot with a team as a free agent.  “I can help make you a better team,” Kaepernick said. “I can help you win games. I know right now the situation likely won’t allow me to step into a starting role. I know I’ll be able to work my way to that, though.” And it shouldn\'t. There are not 32 better backup signal-callers across the country that deserve more of an opportunity than someone who has engineered an NFC Championship run in the last decade. #3 - Colin Kaepernick deserves a chance to right his wrongs     To some, Colin Kaepernick never did anything worth keeping him out of the league for. To others, he didn\'t get a punishment steep enough for actions deemed offensive and disrespectful. No matter where you land on this spectrum, you have to think that five years is a long enough time for someone to understand what they might have done wrong. Kaepernick deserves to move on from his past and have a chance to provide for his family while playing the sport he loved enough to become a professional at. trey wingo@wingozWill anything come of this Colin Kaepernick workout? No idea. But don’t let anyone use the bs “ distraction” argument. Just reply with 2 words: DeShaun Watson… and then carry on with your day.1:24 AM · Apr 2, 20221618170Will anything come of this Colin Kaepernick workout? No idea. But don’t let anyone use the bs “ distraction” argument. Just reply with 2 words: DeShaun Watson… and then carry on with your day.     As Trey Wingo pointed out, Deshaun Watson is not considered the same level of ""distraction"" as Kaepernick, despite having several open cases regarding potential sexual misconduct with numerous accusers. That\'s not to condemn Watson either, as Kaepernick has had charges brought up (and later dropped) in his own past. In 2014, he was accused of assault in a Miami hotel room, but nothing ever came of it. The point is this: Kaepernick never did anything worthy of being blackballed by the NFL besides saying things that those running the show don\'t agree with. It\'s high time Kaepernick is, at least, given a chance as a backup QB, especially considering the likes of Jeff Driskel, Matt Moore, Jalen McClendon, Logan Woodside, and Sean Mannion (to name a few) have been signed since.If he continues to go unsigned, those that are advocating for his return to the league and claiming that the fix is in will have a legitimate argument.     ', 'Previewing the 2019 NFL division title games  Obviously, there are no actual division title games in an isolated fashion the way we have them in college, but instead, things just fell into place for these rivals to potentially play for the divisional crown in their head-to-head matchup over these last two weeks of the regular season.  At this point, all of those teams have played their rivals already once, so it will be interesting to look back at those prior meetings, but we also want to take a look at how everybody has fared throughout the rest of the year and how they will match up schematically as well as personnel-wise.        There are three of those games in Week 16 and another two in Week 17, with one matchup for each week that will also need some other things to happen in the additional week to be decisive in that matter.            Buffalo Bills @ New England Patriots - Week 16  The situation We have reached Week 16 and the Patriots haven’t even clinched their division yet? What a crazy world we are living in. Buffalo now stands at 10-4, which is the first time they have reached double-digit wins since the turn of the millennium, and they still have an outside shot at winning the AFC East as well as earning a first-round bye.     Since New England already won their first meeting at Orchard Park, the Bills would obviously have to win this game as well as beat the Jets in the season finale, while also needing some help from the Dolphins when they travel to Foxborough. It took me a while to figure this out, since I thought the Bills would actually own the tie-breaker in case these two teams were to tie the season series at one apiece, with Buffalo having a better win-loss percentage in conference play. In fact, it is the Pats, however, who would have a better record in common games, which overrules conference play. Regardless, this could still be a determining game and at least is crucial to the final seedings in the AFC, especially with Kansas City hoping for an upset and a chance to steal that number two seed from New England.  Introducing both teams After the Patriots won their first eight games of the season, they have now gone 3-3 since then. Their offense has been really sputtering for most of that stretch and there is no help in sight when it comes to pass-catchers.     Tom Brady has been frustrated with the young corp of receivers and he has had plenty of misfires himself. The defense has put up some historical numbers and really bailed these guys out, combined with a few blocked punts and other special teams play. With that being said, they have not been able to slow down the elite quarterbacks in the AFC and they just allowed the Bengals to go right down the field on them on their opening possession, while Joe Mixon went for over 100 yards in the first half alone. At the same time, they are still in line for a first-round bye in the playoffs and now have seen every division leader in their conference, meaning you are pretty much assured that Belichick will put together a game-plan to keep whoever travels to New England off balance with unscouted looks and little wrinkles. On offense, they are clearly trying to work rookie receiver N’Keal Harry into the mix, when you look at how his snaps and touches have gone up. While their rushing attack hasn’t been the same without their starting tight-end and fullback from a year ago, they are starting to use all their backs in different ways.     Sean McDermott and Brandon Beane have truly put something special together up in the Buffalo, with the roster they have constructed and the culture they have established around the organization. Offensively, they have completely changed their identity from a downhill run team with multiple tight-ends and backs to running 11 personnel more than almost anybody in the league and using a more up-tempo approach under Brian Daboll. Josh Allen has looked more comfortable that way and played like a top ten QB because of it. Rookie Devin Singletary has really come along for them as a dual-threat back, which made LeSean McCoy expendable before the year started. Cole Beasley has been great for them working in the middle of the field and John Brown has earned their trust as the go-to target. Defensively, they have allowed an average of 14.3 points per game over the second half of their season and really hit their stride over the last month.     Their pass rush is coming to life more and more as the year moves along, their young linebackers are flying around and Tre’Davious White has played at an All-Pro level, for a team that is outstanding at game-planning on the back-end. The two real concerns I have with the Bills are a missing big-bodied wideout to make plays individually and defending teams who can bash them in the power run game. The Xs and Os Looking at the strengths of these two teams, you can probably expect something similar to that 16-10 game in Buffalo back in week four. Both squads came into that matchup at 3-0 with little competition up to that point. Tom Brady and Josh Allen struggled mightily in that meeting, as neither one of them even completed half of their passes or threw a touchdown and combined for four interceptions. However, while Brady has heard more doubters as the year has gone along, Allen is now at a different stage of his development, leading an offense that fits him a lot better. Three of those picks were on the Bills QB and he left the game at the start of the fourth quarter. The Pats also blocked a punt and still, there was the hometeam at the three-yard line a few minutes later and attempting three more drives down six points.     When you look at how both teams have been trending since then, Buffalo is probably the more dangerous squad because of the evolvement of the offense and the rise of their pass rush. With that being said, Belichick’s troops rarely lose at home in general and they have a huge advantage when it comes to all those DBs crowding that undersized Bills’ receiving corp, with some zone sprinkled in to fool the opposition. The real question will be if the Pats can move the ball enough themselves or get some cheap points off a trick-play. Dallas Cowboys @ Philadelphia Eagles - Week 16 Dallas Cowboys     The situation It has felt like this would be the only game that really matters in an NFC East race for the last month or so now – even if the two contenders have been moving at the speed of snails for most of it. Compared to some other of these late-season finishes, where some teams have gotten really hot later on, the Cowboys and Eagles have trumped each with lowlights. Dallas got embarrassed at home on Thanksgiving only for Philly to lose at Miami a few days later. Then the Cowboys followed that up by making Mitch Trubisky look like an MVP candidate on Thursday night, while it took the Eagles until overtime to grab their first lead over the Eli-Manning Giants, who were losers of nine straight at that point. This last weekend both teams got back to their winning ways, but in every different fashion – the Eagles struggled with the Redskins until the final seconds of that game, while the Cowboys finally beat their first opponent with a winning record all year in a 44-21 beatdown of the Rams. The Cowboys would clinch the division with a win this weekend, while the Eagles would also have to win at MetLife the following week.     Introducing both teams The Cowboys have given us plenty of ammunition to make fun of their fans for years now, but when you think about their 2019 season, you almost have to feel annoyed for them. They come out of the gate looking like a juggernaut against some bad teams and then lose to all six teams with a winning record, before pulling out a dominant performance against the surging Rams, where they finally look like the ultra-talented team we thought they were before the year kicked off. Their speaking captains not even knowing the general language on a coin toss was the climax for a badly coached team. I like some of the things OC Kellen Moore has done with motions and different formations to scheme open receivers, but this defense has given up 82 combined points to Sam Darnold, Jeff Driskel and Mitch Trubisky and some of their situational decisions and awareness have been mind-boggling.     With that being said, the O-line looked like the best in the league with Zeke going off for 160 yards and two TDs while producing twice as many sacks defensively as they surrender and coming up with a couple more turnovers. For the Eagles, this has been a very underwhelming season altogether. They have given their fans hope with a Thursday Night win at Lambeau Field and dominant showings against the Jets and Bills, but had no chance in their first meeting with the Cowboys, looked lifeless against the Seahawks and messed up that trip to South Beach. What I thought was one of the more talented rosters in the league has been hampered by injuries and they simply haven’t played a complete game in a couple of months now. Only six teams have dropped more passes than their guys, only rookie Daniel Jones has fumbled the ball more than Carson Wentz and the defense has allowed a touchdown of more than 40 yards in each of the last four weeks.     Last Sunday, former Houston quarterback Greg Ward was the only receiver to catch a pass for the Eagles. The one guy that has really flashed recently is running Miles Sanders, who I said one of the top candidates for Offensive Rookie of the Year before the season kicked off. Outside of him, Carson Wentz has been dragging his team to wins these last two weeks despite no dependable receivers and Jim Schwartz surrendering easy touchdowns by calling cover-zero blitzes on third & long. The Xs and Os Looking at how these two teams match up, the Cowboys have a clear advantage with their offensive skill positions against that Philly secondary. For a team that struggled to slow down Washington last week, facing Dallas’ number one ranked total offense, which already put up 37 points against them in their first meeting, is scary. The biggest gamebreakers will be those two explosive backs on either side, who both looked as good as they have done all year this past Sunday. However, to me what will decide this game will be the battle at the line of scrimmage and the turnover race. The Cowboys O-line looked amazing against the Rams, but Fletcher Cox has given them some trouble through the years and their starting left guard is now on IR.     The Eagles front, on the other hand, has been hit quite a bit and will face a pretty strong Dallas pass rush, but those guys have disappeared in a lot of their big games. Lincoln Financial Field and the Eagles health could the X-factors here. We know that the Philly fans don’t shy away from booing anybody – including their home team – but if things go right for their home team, that atmosphere can have an effect on the opposition. Moreover, Jordan Howard, Lane Johnson, and Nelson Agholor could all return this week and if they are on the edge, there is really nothing they should save themselves for. Based on the starters on either side of the ball, the Cowboys should clearly be the favorites, but we have seen both Dallas come up short in the prime matchups and Philly shock people as underdogs. Green Bay Packers @ Minnesota Vikings - Week 16      The situation Once again, for this matchup to decide who will win the NFC North, Week 17 has to be taken into account as well, but let’s look at these teams coming into Sunday first. The 11-3 Packers are traveling to Minneapolis with a spot in the playoff secured already, while the Vikings are far from their goal of playing in January at 10-4. If the home team wins this divisional battle, they would book a ticket to the postseason and could still hope for the Pack to lose at Detroit in the season finale, while winning their week 17 matchup against the Bears, in order to win the North. However, the Vikes could also still fall out of the postseason race altogether with home losses to the Packers and Bears, if the Rams win their final two games.     The Packers have the upper hand here due to their win-loss percentage in common games, but the Rams also have the tie-breaker over them thanks to a better in-conference record. So Minnesota still has everything to win as well as everything to lose, while Green Bay is looking to secure the division early and keep that number two seed, thanks to a strong record in conference play. Introducing both teams Having watched every single game the Packers have played all year, it is crazy to think they are 11-3 as the two seed right now. Versus the Bears alone a bad Mitch Trubisky throw into the end-zone and a pitch not being made for a walk-in touchdown on the final play of the game have given them two wins. They were also gifted a couple of hands to the face calls to beat Detroit, a different spot for Christian McCaffrey could have sent that game to overtime and when they traveled to San Francisco, they got absolutely blown out.     With that being said, I liked Green Bay before the season started and there is still reason to. Matt LaFleur’s offense has been at least some upgrade, Aaron Jones is continuing to emerge as one of the more dynamic two-way backs in the game and Aaron Rodgers is second behind only Jameis Winston with 35 passes of 25+ yards while having thrown 22 interceptions less. Defensively, this group looked a lot different at the start of the year, when they held the Bears, Vikings, and Broncos to a combined 45 points. I still like Mitte Pettine’s creative blitzes and the way he puts his two great pass rushers in one-on-one situations, but they struggle with teams that combo-block their interior defenders in the run game and they are susceptible to some big plays through the air. The Vikings, on the other hand, are looking like one of the more complete teams in football. Now with Adam Thielen back in the lineup, they have two legitimate playmakers at receiver, Kyle Rudolph has been used more as a blocker this year but has also come up clutch for them on several occasions and Kirk Cousins has been playing as well as he has ever done, pushing the ball down the field for big plays while also taking care it.     The key to Minnesota’s offense, however, is superstar running back Dalvin Cook and we will have to monitor his status closely after banging up that shoulder once again. The way they utilize him in the zone run game and put the ball in his hands on screen passes can dictate game-scripts. Defensively, their corner play has taken a big dip from the years prior, especially with Xavier Rhoades looking like a shell of himself. However, Eric Kendricks has become one of the premier middle linebackers in the game and that defensive line has shown the ability to take over some games. Last Sunday, it looked like the Vikings would go into halftime down 13-12 when the Chargers easily were in field goal range already, but a strip-sack directly led to a touchdown the other way and the defense dominated the second half. Six more turnovers and a shutout led to a final score of 39-10.     The Xs and Os When these two teams step on the field on Monday night, I truly believe the Vikings are the more complete group. Their defense is so disciplined that they won’t give away anything easy. Whether that maybe their defensive ends peeling off with guys on the backside of bootlegs or their layered pass rush that makes it tough for Rodgers to extend plays. At the same time, we have seen the great offensive play-callers take advantage of some of the limited coverage variations by making it tough for the defenders to pass on assignments and I don’t think Minnesota has anybody who can cover Davante Adams. On the other side of the ball, the Packers will have a tough time slowing down that Viking attack. This is a situation where the biggest strength for Minnesota – the run game – faces the biggest weakness for Green Bay – their interior rush defense. The status of Dalvin Cook – and his back-up rookie Alexander Mattison for that matter – will be a huge factor because of that.     In theory, Jaire Alexander and Kevin King should match up pretty well against that receiving duo for the Vikes, but we have seen those guys get loose against the Pack plenty of times, especially when they have a lot of field to work with on post-routes and such as off play-action. Tennessee Titans @ Houston Texans - Week 17  The situation With the Texans’ 24-21 win in Nashville last Sunday, it took a little bit out of this week 17 rematch, but the AFC South and Wild-Card situation is far from being decided. Houston is traveling to Tampa Bay this Saturday for the early-window game to face a smoking hot Bucs squad. The Titans, on the other hand, face one of the NFL elites in the Saints, but at the least, they get them at home.     If Houston wins this weekend, they would already clinch the division thanks to a better record within the South. If they were to lose and the Titans pull off another improbable victory at home, this matchup would once again decide who gets to wear the crown at ten wins. Let’s say they both win their week 16 games – at that point, Houston wouldn’t really have much to play for, depending on what the three AFC teams in front of them do, and could actually sit some of their starters, which would open up a path to a Wildcard spot for Tennessee. They would then hope for the Steelers to lose at least one of their last two games – at the Jets and at the Ravens. And as crazy as it sounds – if the Texans lose out while the Steelers win out, they would be out of the playoffs entirely. Introducing both teams     Prior to last Sunday, you could have easily argued that the Titans were the hottest team in the entire league not named Baltimore. They had won six of their last seven games, including an upset over the Chiefs, a clutch win in Indianapolis and beatdowns of the Jaguars and Raiders. That run was allowed by Derrick Henry running over defenses every week and sparked by some brilliant plays by Ryan Tannehill once he was inserted into the starting lineup. Another guy who has been on fire is rookie receiver A.J. Brown, whose 267 receiving yards and three touchdowns over the last two games lead all NFL players. Defensively, they allow just under 20 points, have forced 22 turnovers and hadn’t allowed a 100-yard rusher outside of Christian McCaffrey all year long. I have been a fan of defensive coordinator Dean Pees for a long time now because of the way he mixes up coverages and really keeps offenses on their heels with where he brings pressure from in combination with who he drops out. With Tennessee, it is about all three faces of the game, however, as their special teams have actually changed games. They blocked a potential game-tying field goal versus Kansas City and they took another blocked kick back for a touchdown in a 17-17 game at Indy.     While their own field goal kicker situation has been a mess, they easily lead the league with six blocks themselves and Brett Kern is number on with 37 punts downed inside the opposing 20. The Texans, on the other hand, have been one of the more frustrating teams to watch this year, simply because they have been so up-and-down on a weekly basis. One week the Panthers hold them to 16 points, the next they explode for 53 against the Falcons. They win at Arrowhead and build some momentum, but come out of their bye week completely flat in an embarrassing 41-7 loss at Baltimore. And in December alone they finally got a win over the Patriots only to find themselves in a 38-3 hole against the Broncos the next week. With that win over the Titans they have taken control of their destiny, but am I supposed to trust them again an explosive Bucs team this week already again?     A lot of people might think Houston has one of the best defenses in the league because of what they see against New England in primetime, but they have been highly questionable for pretty much the entire year. The only two teams that haven’t scored at least 20 points on them this year have been the Jaguars and Panthers. They have major issues in the secondary – outside of Justin Reid – and they have allowed a league-worst 48 percent of opposing third downs to be converted. The Texans’ success is all because of Deshaun Watson putting together some magic. When he is on, he can get as hot as anybody outside of Patrick Mahomes, but they need that full receiving crew to really kick into gear.  The Xs and Os Unlike the other games we are discussing here, we have just seen this matchup play out and have a pretty good understanding of what could happen in week 17. However, the Titans were without their best corner Adoree Jackson and Derrick Henry was clearly not 100 percent with a bad hamstring, after not having practiced all week.     Having those two back all full strength potentially could be big and it’s a weekly guessing game for the Texans if speedster Will Fuller will be available. Without him, they are 2-2 this season and they scored almost five points less per game, which would be even more if they didn’t put up some points against Denver in garbage time. Outside of that, the Titans could easily have the heads-up in this matchup already. In a three-point game, they had a field goal blocked on their opening series, a pass at the goal-line come out of the receiver’s arms and pop right into the ones of Whitney Mercilus to set up a Texans touchdown and a great pass by their punter be denied only by an even better play by the corner. The Texans got quite a big break heading to Tampa Bay, as the Bucs will likely be without their two star receivers, while Tennessee hosts the Saints, but if this rematch ends up deciding the division winner, this will be another close, probably more high-scoring game.     San Francisco 49ers @ Seattle Seahawks - Week 17  The situation And then there’s the biggest game left over these last two weeks of the regular season. It is not just a huge matchup because two heavyweights square off against each other for what will decide the NFC West, but also the implications it will have on the rest of the playoffs. The 49ers started the season 8-0 but now have gone 3-3 since. Of course, their losses came to Seattle in an overtime thriller, in Baltimore on a last-second field goal and now again in dramatic fashion against the Falcons, when they were missing half of their starters on defense. So let’s not act this is not a great team still. Seattle, on the other hand, hasn’t won a game by more than one possession since week four, while also losing two games by multiple scores since then.     With the ‘Hawks having won the first matchup between the two, they are ahead for now, but no matter what happens in week 16, this game will decide the division champion – San Francisco would at least hold the tie-breaker on common opponents and Seattle would have swept the season series if they won. Both these teams could still be the one or the six seed and almost anything in-between, outside of that fourth spot which is reserved for the worst division in the NFL. (For the football nerds: Moreover, the Vikings could still jump whoever comes short of winning the West, although they would only be ahead of the Niners at the same record. The craziest scenario for me would be Seattle losing to the Cardinals before beating San Fran, while Green Bay wins out and New Orleans loses one of their final two games – which would make the Packers the number one seed, the Saints second and the Seahawks third. Also, somehow the Vikings are still alive for a first-round bye if the Seahawks, Saints, and Packers all were to lose out.)     Introducing both teams I really don’t think this loss to Atlanta should concern 49ers fans too much when it comes to the quality of their team, even though it obviously influences their final seeding in the NFC. It took review on a play where the game’s best receiver just crossed the goal-line in the final seconds to lose that game, despite San Francisco being without five defensive starters and coming off a huge win in New Orleans. One of the replacements was the guy I thought was responsible for that go-ahead touchdown. This is still one of the elite groups in the league as far as I’m concerned. Kyle Shanahan is the best offensive play-caller in the game today for my money, because of the way he designs his run game out of different personnel packages and all those bootlegs, throwback screens, etc. off it. With 20 drops on the season, there are some concerns around this receiving corp as George Kittle at one point was targeted 11 straight times on Sunday, but they have had a few guys come up with big plays for them. San Francisco also has a nice mix of skill-sets with their three backs and none of them should be too tired as we approach Christmas.     Their defense – when healthy – might be the best in the entire league, with the combination of depth and talent on the D-line, Fred Warner emerging as a playmaker at middle linebacker and underrated pieces in the secondary. They have shown that they can play in multiple ways. The Seahawks, on the other hand, might be coming off a victory and own the number one overall seed in the conference at this moment, but they have certainly given me more reason for concern. These are mostly due to a defense that is perceived differently than what it should be. Seattle is 29th in passing yards allowed and they have given up under 20 points just twice – against the Cardinals and Eagles. Obviously, Bobby Wagner, K.J. Wright and those guys are great, but this season they have struggled to put games away because of that unit and they have allowed huge days to the great receivers in this league. This team’s success really is mostly due to their MVP candidate Russell Wilson.     If Baltimore wraps up the number one seed and he doesn’t have two horrific games all of a sudden, Lamar Jackson will win the award, but I certainly believe Russ would be a worthy candidate as well. The Seahawks want to win with a bruising ground game and they are fourth in the league in rushing yards, but whenever they have needed their quarterback to step up and make big plays, he has come through for them. This group has won as much as they have because they have been on the right side of shootouts. However, the losses of Rashaad Penny and Josh Gordon for very different reasons are huge hits. The Xs and Os Looking at the first meeting between these two teams, the final score is very deceiving when you think of how the game actually went. The San Francisco defense was pretty much dominating the game when it was 10-0 with about three minutes left in the first half when Jarran Reed strip-sacked Jimmy G and Jadeveon Clowney scooped it up for a touchdown.     Then it was a slightly overthrown ball to Kendrick Bourne around midfield that set up a short field for Seattle and another strip-sack by Clowney that had the Niners down 21-10 all of a sudden. The 49ers defense countered with their own strip-and-scoop to get back into the game and push it to overtime, where their undrafted rookie kicker missed a potential game-winning field goal. So not only was this a much more defensive-oriented battle than the final score of 27-24 indicates, but the 49ers could have easily won that game as well. What is different this time around is the fact that they will play up in Seattle in front of the 12th man and the stakes couldn’t be higher, since this will feel like a playoff game already and the loser will have an actual road playoff game the following week, while the other team can likely rest their guys for a week. I will be watching if the Seahawks can stay ahead of the sticks because we already saw what that vaunted Niners pass rush can do against the Hawks O-line in the dropback game. At the same time, we could see Clowney dominate San Francisco’s left tackle again, because it may not be Justin Skule filling in anymore, but Joe Staley has looked pretty bad since returning from injury.

It is a notoriously difficult place to fill at the best of times, but it is especially difficult when someone is trying to replace an all-time great like Peyton Manning.  We take a look at every starter who has played for the Denver Broncos in that position since Peyton Manning's retirement. As this has been such an unstable position for the franchise after Peyton Manning, in most seasons, they have had multiple starters in the given position. So, for the purposes of clarity, only those who started most games are listed at the top and others who played in those seasons are mentioned separately.                       Denver Broncos quarterbacks since Peyton Manning retired 2016 and 2017 - Trevor Siemian Right after Peyton Manning retired, Brock Osweiler, who had started some of the games the previous year with Peyton Manning in their Super Bowl-winning season, left for the Houston Texans to become their starter. That opened up the field for third-choice Trevor Siemian to compete with rookie Paxton Lynch and veteran Mark Sanchez, and Siemian eventually became the starter.     James Palmer@JamesPalmerTVTrevor Siemian is the only QB with a winning record for the #Broncos since Peyton Manning retired entering the 2016 seasonTrevor Siemian (13-11), Case Keenum (6-10), Paxton Lynch (1-3), Joe Flacco (0-4) and Brock Osweiler (0-4)35588Trevor Siemian is the only QB with a winning record for the #Broncos since Peyton Manning retired entering the 2016 seasonTrevor Siemian (13-11), Case Keenum (6-10), Paxton Lynch (1-3), Joe Flacco (0-4) and Brock Osweiler (0-4) In 2016, he played 14 of 16 games for the Denver Broncos (the last two weeks were quarterbacked by Paxton Lynch) and established himself as the first choice. Even though the Broncos missed the playoffs, he finished with a passer rating of 84.6 that was higher than Peyton Manning and Brock Osweiler from the previous season. Over the last six weeks of his season from Weeks 8 to 14, he averaged more than 300 yards, behind only Tom Brady and Kirk Cousins. He was named a Pro Bowl alternate but did not accept the invitation due to the shoulder surgery he went ahead with after Week 14.        In 2017, now firmly established as a starter but under new coach Vance Joseph, he began the season strongly, and the high point was a game against the Dallas Cowboys where he threw four touchdowns. In Week 6, he suffered a shoulder injury. Then, over the next few weeks, his production declined. He was benched in favor of the returning Brock Osweiler in Week 9, who was himself then relieved by Paxton Lynch in Week 12. After Lynch was injured in that game, Siemian got another chance to lead the Broncos. But another shoulder injury in Week 15 spelled the end of his career with the Broncos as Brock Osweiler relieved him in that game and started in Week 16.     2018 - Case Keenum After the upheaval of the previous season, when the Broncos had three quarterbacks trading places, head coach Vance Joseph chose to reunite with former Houston Texans quarterback Case Keenum, who they traded from the Minnesota Vikings. They stuck with him throughout the season and he started all 16 games as the Broncos went 6-10.    He threw for 3,890 yards with a 62.3 completion rate. He had 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, with a 81.2 passer rating. He was traded to the Washington Redskins for a seventh-round pick in 2019.     2019 - Joe Flacco In 2019, the Denver Broncos decided to go with Joe Flacco, who had won one Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens. There were eerie parallels with Peyton Manning as they plumped for a veteran quarterback and former Super Bowl MVP. He was named the starter and had the job until he faced a neck injury in Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts. In those eight games that he started, he had 1,822 passing yards, six touchdowns, five interceptions, and an 85.1 passer rating. He was subsequently released by the Broncos and went on to sign with the New York Jets, where he still is currently.        After Joe Flacco was injured, he was replaced by Brandon Allen for three games before Drew Lock stepped in for the final five games of the season. The rookie quarterback finished with 1,020 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions in those five games and equalled John Elway's franchise record for most wins by a rookie in Broncos history. His four wins came in just five games compared to the 10 taken by Elway. Peter Baugh@Peter_BaughDrew Lock's rookie year stats for the #Broncos: •5 games played •1,020 yards (204 a game)•7 TD•3 interceptions •4-1 record776Drew Lock's rookie year stats for the #Broncos: •5 games played •1,020 yards (204 a game)•7 TD•3 interceptions •4-1 record 2020 - Drew Lock For his performances the previous season, Lock was named the starter for 2020. In Week 2, he injured his shoulder and would not return until Week 6. During that period, Jeff Driskel and Brett Rypien started one game each. In Week 12, due to a COVID outbreak among the quarterback corps, running back Phillip Lindsay started under center.     Lock's performances in his second season were not up to standard. Case in point, he had 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. This was the joint highest in the league , tied with Carson Wentz, despite Lock only playing 13 matches. His 57.3 completion rate was the lowest among all quarterbacks with, at least, 150 passing attempts that season.    2021 - Teddy Bridgewater In 2021, Teddy Bridgewater, the 2015 Pro Bowler, joined the team from the Carolina Panthers. He beat out Drew Lock to become the starter, though Lock started three games in each of which Bridgewater was out injured. In the 13 games that he started, he threw for 3,052 yards, 18 touchdowns, and seven interceptions for a passer rating of 94.9 with a 66.9 completion percentage. At the end of the season, he was traded to the Miami Dolphins as the Denver Broncos acquired Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks.     2022 - Russell Wilson   Russell Wilson joined from the Seattle Seahawks. In a deal that sent Drew Lock to Seattle, along with other players and draft picks, the future hall-of-famer joined the Denver Broncos for a five-year, $245 million deal. The Broncos will hope to replicate the success they had with Peyton Manning when they last had a future hall-of-famer as their quarterback.     ""]"
73,Drew Brees,"[""Was 2010 really Drew Brees’ peak? Revisiting former Saints QB’s Super Bowl MVP-winning season  Drew Brees retired as the quarterback with the most passing yards and touchdowns. Although Tom Brady has now overtaken most of his records, in terms of yards per game, Brees is still higher than everyone on the list. To reach such a level, you need to be consistently good and not just be good for a couple of seasons.  What would be a good starting point if we wanted to determine Brees' peak? Brees never won the league MVP award, which was an outlier in an otherwise fantastic career. But he did win a Super Bowl in 2010 and took home the Super Bowl MVP award as well. The question is whether that can be considered his peak.        From a personal achievement standpoint, there can be nothing greater for an NFL player than lifting the Lombardi Trophy and getting that ring. But as we all know, quarterbacks alone cannot win the Super Bowl. To judge Drew Brees' peak, we have to look at the stats.           Drew Brees' stats: when did he reach peak performance? Drew Brees played very well compared to most other quarterbacks in the league in 2010, the season he won the Super Bowl. He threw for 4,620 yards but only for 33 touchdowns, one fewer than a year prior. He also threw 22 interceptions, the highest of his career. His passer rating was just 90.9. Between that season and until his retirement, he never had a worse passer rating in any season. So, quite clearly, 2010 did not see Drew Brees at his best. His peak must instead lie between 2011 and 2016, because in those six seasons, he crossed more than 300 passing yards per game. But even from there, there is one season that stands out.     Right after winning the Super Bowl, Brees embarked on the most productive season of his career in 2011. He threw for 5,476 yards and for 46 touchdowns (both career highs). His 14 interceptions were far fewer than they were a season earlier. He ended up with a quarterback rating of 110.6. If indeed Drew Brees reached a peak, it was in this year. However, he was defeated in the MVP stakes by one Aaron Rodgers, who set the NFL record with a passer rating of 122.5 that season. The right way to talk about Drew Brees is not so much a peak as an extremely high valley. Between 2011 and 2016, he threw for more than 5,000 yards in four of those six seasons. In the two years he did not reach that mark, he still had more than 4,800 yards. He also threw for more than 40 touchdowns in consecutive seasons in 2011 and 2012. For those who swear by passer ratings, they could point out that his peak came later on beginning in 2015. Since that year and until his retirement, his passer rating never fell below 100. His touchdown output dropped as he aged, but he became more mature as well, throwing far fewer interceptions. If anyone wanted to consider both the passer rating and his yardage, 2015 and 2016 were probably the sweet spots.

Drew Brees 2017 -- 72.0%*Through 11 games Ultimately, it shows just how good Drew Brees was over such a long period that it is extremely difficult to point out one season of greatness. He was just consistently high-performing and remains the most explosive passer in NFL history. He might never have won the NFL MVP award, but there were very few players who were as fun to watch as Drew Brees.     "", ""NFL Rumor: Is Drew Brees retiring?  As the clock hit zeros and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers began to celebrate every New Orleans Saints fan started to think about life after Drew Brees. It had been a big topic all week in the NFL if Drew Brees was going to retire after the 2021 NFL Playoffs. Looking at his demeanor and his reaction it is safe to say that Drew Brees may have played his last game behind center for the Saints.  If Drew Brees were to come back to the Saints in the 2021 NFL Season it would be because of the way he lost on Sunday. Brees would put out his worst performance of the 2020-2021 NFL Season against the Buccaneers. Drew Brees would only throw for 134 yards and one touchdown.        The stat that will haunt him is the three interceptions that he threw on Sunday against the Bucs. This is the most he has thrown all season and almost matched the total he threw all season in 2019.            New Orleans Saints fans will be sitting on the edge of their seats waiting to hear if Drew Brees will stay or walk away.  Why Drew Brees will retire this off-season Let's not forget that the 20 year veteran suffered a horrific injury that caused him to collapse his lung. Brees is 42 years old and the injuries now take longer to heal. He has done everything and more in his NFL career and will be in the Hall of Fame. EMOTIONAL PHOTOS: Saints Quarterback Drew Brees did the only thing he knew to do after a loss like that against the Bucs last night...spend two hours with his family after the game in the endzone. ⚜️ pic.twitter.com/yOg9s4MU7X— wdsu (@wdsu) January 18, 2021     Brees has won a Super Bowl and has been successful his entire NFL career. The questions that he will ask himself this off-season. What else can I do? Am I 100% okay with never playing another snap? What are the benefits of me coming back?These are all questions that Brees will have to answer within himself. Drew Brees is a family man and has a wife and children that will have a say in what he decides to do with his decision. With the injury and all the success he has had it would make sense for him to walk away. No one can blame him for wanting to retire. He gave the NFL 20 great years. As Tom Brady and Drew Brees hug and say goodbye after a long talk on the field, Brady throws a touchdown pass to Brees’ son.

All NFL fans want to say is Thank you for 20 years of great football. Thank you for showing that size doesn't matter at the quarterback position. Finally, thank you for playing for the love of football.     "", 'NFL: Top 5 moments of Drew Brees\' career  The New Orleans Saints franchise quarterback, Drew Brees, announced his retirement on Sunday, March 14, 2021. That comes after a 20-year NFL career, x1 Super Bowl win, 80,358-yards passing (1st all-time), 571 TD passes (second all time) and a highlight reel of accurate passing that aspiring QBs will be watching forever.  The one shining light (besides an impeccable career, of course), the Purdue University graduate will join up with NBC Sports to work as an analyst. That means Saints fans will still get to see plenty of him once the 2021 NFL season gets underway.        Welcome to the team, @drewbrees!

He will be forever revered for the outstanding work he has done in the community, too. After extensive efforts to help rebuild the homes and communities of New Orleans residents post-hurricane Katrina in 2006, Drew Brees, along with former teammate LaDainian Tomlinson, were selected as the co-recipients of the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award. That was in recognition of both players\' voluntary and charity work. Though it might not be that second Super Bowl ring everyone wanted to see, the Walter Payton Man of the Year award is one of the most prestigious honors in football. It\'s a true testament to the character of Drew Brees as a man that he was so quick to get involved in New Orleans\' recovery from the disaster.     Not every player puts community outreach at the top of their agenda when they agree to join a new team. But hats off to \'Breesus,\' the Brees family, Tomlinson and the rest of the Saints family for all the work they did back in 2005-o6 and beyond. Player performances on and off the field are often cited as a key part of a city\'s rebuild. Drew Brees certainly played his part.  #4 2011 Offensive Player of the Year (should have been MVP) I was today years old when Drew Brees led the Saints through a remixed ""Throwed Off"" in a pre-game huddle in 2011. pic.twitter.com/zjRaAqO82c— Ben Baby (@Ben_Baby) March 15, 2021     Back in 2011, Drew Brees shattered Dan Marino\'s all-time single-season passing record by notching up 5,476 yards. In most years, that kind of record-breaking total would have meant MVP honors. Unfortunately for Drew Brees, though, QB Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers was also in fine fettle and, to the utter disbelief of most Louisiana natives, Rodgers stole in on the MVP vote. That meant Drew Brees had to make do with the Offensive Player of the Year award. Considering Drew Brees also led the NFL in completion percentage and passing TDs (46) in 2011, it\'s easy to see why many football fans -- and not just in New Orleans -- felt number #9 was snubbed that year. I personally believe he was, too. In 2011, Drew Brees was the best football player on the planet. Hence this achievement makes the list at number four.

Drew Brees put on one of the best QB displays of all time, throwing for 371 yards and five touchdowns, while registering a perfect passer rating of 158.3, as the Saints routed the Patriots 38-17. Drew Brees has had a lot of brilliant performances in black and gold, but, for me, this one was the best of them all.      #2 Drew Brees becomes the NFL\'s all-time leading passer in 2018 Former Purdue QB Drew Brees becomes the NFL’s all-time leader in passing yards. pic.twitter.com/r1brnPxcAc— CFB Kings (@CFBKings) October 9, 2018 In Week 5 of the 2018 NFL season, Drew Brees found Tre\'Quan Smith with a beautiful lofted pass that the Saints\' receiver took all the way to the crib for a 62-yard TD. Connecting on that TD pass to Smith, Brees broke Peyton Manning\'s record for most passing yards in the NFL, a record which at that point stood at 71,940 yards. The celebrations were a joy to watch (if you haven\'t already).      Sure, Tom Brady (79,204 yards) will surpass Drew Brees\'s record of 80,358 yards by about Week 4 or 5 of the 2021 NFL season, but you can\'t take the record-breaking moment away from Drew Brees. Passing any record set by the great Peyton Manning has to rank highly on Drew Brees\'s personal list of accolades. That\'s why it creeps in at number two here.  #1 Winning the Super Bowl with New Orleans in 2009-10 Congrats to @drewbrees on a wonderful career.

As a child, I would always watch \'grid-iron, but I never picked a team to support. It was hard work staying up for the late-night games with school in the morning. Also, the highlight shows on Channel 4 always made every team look great, so it was impossible to pick just one. Depressed about the Patriots\' early 2000s dominance and the lack of affordable TV coverage of the NFL in the UK, I did the unthinkable: I stopped watching the NFL for a few years. Aged 18, I moved in with a friend, and we purchased SKY TV, and the NFL was back on. The reason I became a Saints fan is that my friend and I just so happened to turn on the TV in time to watch the build-up and televised broadcast of Super Bowl XLlV on February 7, 2010.     Before the game, everybody was talking about this guy, Drew Brees, who\'d had a great year, done a ton of work for the community and had bounced back from a tough time in San Diego to become one of the NFL\'s elite QBs. I thought to myself, I like this dude -- he seems like a stand-up guy! And so I decided to back the underdog in that game. It was Brees\'s Saints (underdogs) against Manning\'s Colts (favorites). The Saints came back to win 31-17. Drew Brees tied the Super Bowl record of 32 pass completions and won the MVP Award, throwing for 288 yards and two touchdowns. I\'ve supported the Saints ever since, never missing a game on TV, patiently hoping coach Payton and Brees would lead us back to another Super Bowl, forever optimistic. As a fan, it\'s truly a punch in the gut to think that Drew Brees won\'t be the Saints signal-caller next season and that we won\'t now get to see him in action in his second Super Bowl -- I really think he deserved another ring.     But, boy, am I glad I got to see his greatest ever moment a mere three hours into my obsession.It will stay with me forever.Thank you, Drew! Also Read: What is Drew Brees’ current contract?     ', 'Stephen A. Smith calls Rodgers\' performance ""shameful"" after Packers\' blowout loss against Saints  Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers suffered a 38-3 blowout loss against the New Orleans Saints in Week 1 of the 2021 season. No one saw this defeat coming.  Rodgers has perhaps already had his worst game of the year in Week 1. He went 15/28 for only 133 yards and two interceptions as the offense never got going.        Jameis Winston, on the other hand, was stellar, throwing for five touchdowns and 148 passing yards on the way to routing the Packers.           Stephen A. Smith tears Rodgers apart It was indeed a challenging game to watch for Packers fans and one of the team\'s most famous fans, Stephen A. Smith, gave a damning verdict on the reigning MVP\'s performance. Smith called it ""the most shameful performance of Aaron Rodgers\' career"" and even went as far as saying the quarterback didn\'t care about the game or the outcome. Smith did not stop there. He added that the performance was ""atrocious"" and ""embarrassing"" for Rodgers. ""That was the most atrocious performance of [Aaron Rodgers\'] career. He was so awful that embarrassing doesn\'t even begin to describe it.""@stephenasmith calls Sunday\'s game against the Saints the ""most shameful performance of Aaron Rodgers\' career."" 😶 pic.twitter.com/J72NWKlhI8— First Take (@FirstTake) September 13, 2021     Smith not only ripped into Rodgers but also went after head coach Matt LaFleur. Smith said that LeFluer did not have the team prepared adequately, and given it was the opening game of the year, that should not be happening. Even though the Packers are still well and truly in the running to win the division, this type of loss could have long-lasting effects on the team. Rodgers played so poorly on Sunday that the much-maligned Jordan Love was given snaps after the former MVP was benched. Now, this is more likely to do with the fact that the scoreline was already out of hand, and the Packers didn\'t have much to lose. Then there are the Saints. Clearly, without Drew Brees, they will not be the offensive powerhouse they have been in the past few years, but they can still pack a punch with wideout Michael Thomas. Jameis Winston looked as good as ever, but most are still unsure exactly where the Saints sit in the NFC race, unlike the Packers, who many believe will be there come the postseason. However, after a result like this, questions have to be asked, and the fact that a performance like this happened in Week 1 is troubling.     Despite the poor outing, it is only one game, and the Packers will look to get back on the winners\' list next week when they face the Detroit Lions.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 2 TV Schedule     ', ""New Orleans Saints stop Tom Brady in defensive performance  Tom Brady has had an epic career, as well as an epic start to the 2021-2022 NFL season. But that all came to a crashing halt during last night's jaw-dropping shutout loss to the New Orleans Saints by a score of 9-0.  Although the Saints' offense was also limited by an offense quarterbacked by Taysom Hill and without head coach Sean Payton, out because of testing positive for COVID, their defense did what it typically does against Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which baffles them beyond epic proportions.

Tom Brady was held in check against the Saints in a performance not replicated in 15 years New Orleans Saints v Tampa Bay Buccaneers     On Sunday Night Football, the New Orleans Saints did the unthinkable: limit Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers offense to zero points for the entire game. This feat has not been done to Tom Brady in 15 years, since the Miami Dolphins shut out Brady's New England Patriots by a score of 21-0. As an aside, the head coach of those 2006 Miami Dolphins was none other than Nick Saban, the current head coach and conductor of the University of Alabama's college football dynasty. Saban is also a disciple of Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, so perhaps it's not that much of a surprise that it was that team that last shut out Brady. The record for a quarterback not being shut out in an NFL game currently sits at 255 games and is held by former New Orleans Saints quarterback and current NBC Sunday Night Football analyst Drew Brees. Ironically, it was Brees's former team that did a number on Brady and the Buccaneers' offense. The front four constantly sent pressure and collapsed the pocket around Brady, which is universally known as kryptonite for the seven-time Super Bowl champion.     And not to take away from a great defensive game from the Saints' defense, but during the course of the game, the Buccaneers also lost receivers Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and running back Leonard Fournette.

The outlook for the Buccaneers may appear bleak after shooting blanks against the Saints. But they hope to have Godwin back for the playoffs and also look forward to the return of Antonio Brown, who has been suspended for the past three games for misrepresenting his COVID vaccination status by allegedly using a fake vaccination card.

Not such good news for Roquan Smith though: the talented and hard-hitting linebacker is struggling with an elbow injury and might not be healed in time to lace up the cleats on Sunday (then again it\'s the playoffs, so I wouldn\'t count him totally out at this stage either!).

During the overtime of that November contest, a great defensive effort from Chicago forced New Orleans to punt the pigskin back to Matt Nagy\'s team. Chicago had the W on a plate... but, when it mattered most, the Bears\' offense could only manage a puny 8-yards on 3 downs, and had to hoof it straight back to their gleeful opponents, who went on to win with an FG the very next drive.     The victory had been there for the taking, and Chicago blew it. Sure, that was with Foles in the pocket, and things have been a LOT better since Trubisky returned to action, but moments like that suggest the Bears don\'t quite have enough on offense to outscore the Saints; especially now that wideouts, Michael Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders will be out there for Drew Brees (both missed that Saints win in wk-8). Ranked 23/32 in the NFL for points scored (23pts per game), the Bears just don\'t quite have enough firepower to beat the Saints on their home turf.Prediction: New Orleans Saints 34, Chicago Bears 23     ', ""How many times did Drew Brees throw for 5,000 yards?

Throughout their history, they have seen many talented players come and go, including explosive quarterbacks, dominant defensive players, and dynamic playmakers.  However, when it comes to the greatest New Orleans Saints player ever, one name stands out: Drew Brees.        New Orleans Saints v Carolina Panthers           Brees is a name that will forever be etched in the history of the New Orleans Saints. His 15 seasons with the team were filled with record-breaking performances, clutch moments, and unforgettable victories. Brees' impact on the franchise goes beyond the field, as he became a beloved figure in the city of New Orleans for his leadership, philanthropy, and unwavering commitment to his team and its fans. During his time in the NFL, Brees was one of the most prolific quarterbacks. He broke numerous passing records, including the one for passing yards (Tom Brady has since broken this record), and has the most 5,000-yard seasons ever. He also led the league in passing yards seven times.     Brees was selected to 13 Pro Bowls, named All-Pro five times, and won the Super Bowl with the Saints in 2009, earning Super Bowl MVP honors in the process.

His foundation has raised millions of dollars for charitable causes, and Brees has been recognized for his philanthropy with numerous awards.

74,Tom Savage,"[""NFL 2018: Fantasy Football: 5 Players That are Currently Being Overvalued  With the Fantasy Football season really hotting up, all players Average Draft Positions (ADP) are constantly fluctuating. With reports coming out about injuries and good/bad performances in preseason games, some players are moving up, whilst others are moving down. Here I take a look at 5 players who's ADP is currently too high for my liking.          #5 Deshaun Watson           The hype this offseason for Deshaun Watson has been off the charts, since his spectacular introduction into the league. Watson replaced Tom Savage at halftime in week 1 and went on to play 7 games until an ACL tear in practice ruined his season. Now don’t get me wrong, Watson was incredible in those 7 games. He threw 19 TDs, as well as adding a couple on the ground. He had an immediate rapport with his receivers, DeAndre Hopkins and Will Fuller.  Who knows how many TDs and yards he would have thrown for if injury hadn’t struck. The problem for me is where he is being drafted. Watson’s current ADP is 4.04 and the second QB off of the board. THAT IS INSANE! He is going ahead of last years top scoring QB Russell Wilson, as well as the crafty veterans Tom Brady and Drew Brees.  Yes, Watson has huge upside, but if you’re drafting him in the 4th round, you’re drafting him at his ceiling. I’m not calling for Watson to be a failure this year, but I very much doubt he finishes as the second highest scoring QB.      #4 Derrick Henry Jacksonville Jaguars v Tennessee Titans Henry is a beast. There is no doubting that. He’s a huge man who has exceptional speed for his size. This offseason it looked like he would have the chance to step out of Demarco Murray’s shadow and make the RB1 position his own. That was until the Titans signed Dion Lewis for big money. Lewis had a superb second half to last season. He finished as the RB13, as the Patriots made yet another SuperBowl.      Despite the Titans adding Lewis, Henry is still being drafted at the 3.01 position. That is a big investment for a player who may not even be the lead back for his team by the end of the year. Lewis will surely take the bulk of the passing down work, after catching 32 passes in 2017, compared to Henry’s 11.  Lewis also outproduced Henry on the ground last year. You would imagine that Henry will get the first crack at the early down and goal line work, but if he fails to produce good performances early, then keep an eye on Lewis to overtake him on the depth chart. Before Henry truthers jump on my back about hating on him, I’m not knocking Henry as a player.  If they hadn’t had recruited Lewis then Henry would have the potential to be a top 10 back in this league. But Lewis being there really does hamper Henry’s production. With Henry going 3.01 and Lewis going 5.12, I know who I’d rather take.     #3 Josh Gordon Green Bay Packers v Cleveland Browns Josh Gordon is an athletic freak, who has shown he can be a top receiver in this league. His current ADP is the 4.11 spot, which for me is a little too high. The problem is that Gordon is not currently practicing with the team. He is staying away from the Browns due to a personal reason. It’s rumored that he doesn’t want to be involved in the Browns ‘Hard Knocks’ tapings and is taking care of his mental state away from the cameras. This is great, as players health has to come first.      It does, however, mean he is missing vital time with the team in camp and preseason matches. He isn’t getting the chance to build that rapport with the new QBs in Cleveland, Tyrod Taylor and Baker Mayfield, whereas Jarvis Landry and Antonio Callaway are profiting from Gordon’s absence. The talk is that Gordon will be back with the Browns by the start of the regular season, but drafting him in the 4th round comes with a huge risk.  He is currently being drafted ahead of safer options such as Landry and Marvin Jones. If he is back and with the team soon then he will start to climb my rankings again. Until then, I see him as too big of a risk in the 4th round. #2 Jimmy Graham Arizona Cardinals v Seattle Seahawks     Jimmy Graham hit gold this offseason by signing a 3 year $30 million contract with the Green Bay Packers. Whilst Graham is still a great threat in the end zone, he is nowhere near as effective in other areas of the field.  In 2017, Graham recorded his lowest catch total in a 16 game season since his rookie year. His YPC also dropped dramatically to 9.1 compared to 14.2 in 2017. This shows that Graham isn’t getting downfield much nowadays, and is, therefore, more of a short pass target than in previous years. He is playing with one of the best QBs of all time in Aaron Rodgers, so he will have some fantasy value as he’s likely to score 10 TDs. The problem I have with him is where he is being drafted. Graham’s current ADP is at 5.03 and the 4th TE off of the board. For me, this is way too high.  I have him ranked below Greg Olsen, Kyle Rudolph and Delanie Walker. I would much rather select a younger, more athletic talent in the 5th, such as Jarvis Landry, Marvin Jones or Ronald Jones. Graham will be fantasy relevant this season with the Packers. I just don’t like where he is currently being taken.     #1 Jacksonville D Wild Card Round - Buffalo Bills v Jacksonville Jaguars This Jacksonville defense is one of the most talented defenses the league has seen. It is full of young players at the top of their game. Last season they were far and away the highest scoring defense in the league.  They scored 36 more fantasy points than the second placed defense, the Baltimore Ravens. But the hype with this unit has gone a bit too far for me. Yes, I am projecting them to be the top scoring D/ST again, but there is no way I am taking them at their current ADP. They are currently being taken with the 8.09 pick, which is absolute madness.  That’s ahead of players such as Cooper Kupp, Jamison Crowder, Trey Burton and Robert Woods. Taking them this early means you’re missing out on valuable PPR options such a those previously mentioned.

However, the highest amount of interest is generated by the possible performance of rookies as to see if they can handle the pressure at the pro level.  Here are five of NFL's best offensive rookies as of Week 11!                   #5 Deshaun Watson(QB, Houston Texans) 10,168 passing yards, 90 touchdowns, 151.1 passer rating, CFP national champion, Heisman trophy nominee, Best Male College Athlete ESPY Award winner -- these are few of Deshaun Watson's achievements in his three years as a college football player. Considered by many as scouts as an NFL-ready quarterback, Watson declared for the NFL draft on November 16, 2016. Watson was the No.1 QB prospect coming into the draft and was expected to be the first QB off the board but Mitchell Trubisky beat him in that race. He was picked by the Houston Texans with the 12th pick in the first round. Expected to slot in behind three-year veteran Tom Savage, Watson was surprisingly handed his debut in Texan's season opener against Jacksonville Jaguars at halftime, he threw 102 yards for a touchdown in that game. Watson started the next 6 games for the Texans, throwing 1,597 yards for 19 touchdowns which includes two 5-touchdown games against the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tennessee Titans.     He threw 16 touchdowns in October, setting a record of most touchdowns thrown by a rookie QB in a calendar year. His over-the-top performances won him the AFC offensive player of the month and NFL offensive rookie of the month award in October. #4 Kareem Hunt (RB, Kansas City Chiefs)  Kareem Hunt Part of a non-power 5 conference football program, Kareem Hunt was an undervalued RB all his career and it was the same case coming into the 2017 NFL draft. Picked up by the Kansas City Chiefs with the 86th pick in the draft. He was the 6th RB off the board. Hunt was considered to be backup for Chiefs starting back Spencer Ware but a season-ending knee injury to Ware, in a preseason game forced Andy Reid to start Hunt against the Patriots in the NFL season opener. Against the defending champion, away from home, Hunt put in one of the most memorable performances ever by a rookie on his debut by rushing for 246 yards with 3 touchdowns. In the next two games, he amassed 253 rushing yards while making it to the end-zone 3 times.     As of now he sits safely in the top 3 of NFL's most rushing yards in the season list with 873 yards in 10 games with 6 touchdowns #3 Leonard Fournette (RB, Jacksonville Jaguars) Leonard Fournette A battering ram with the ability to run like the 'Flash', Leonard Fournette is an athletic beast. Picked by a team with one of the best defences but a below-par offence, Fournette has turned the team's fortunes and now they are division leaders. Fournette joined LSU in 2014 to play college football and represented The Tigers for 3 seasons. Winning the 2015 Texas Bowl and 2016 Citrus Bowl during his time LSU, he also won the 2015 NCAA Rushing award for his impressive 1,953 rushing yards which included 3 games for 200 yards or more rushing yards.     In December of 2016, Fournette announced his intention to enter the 2017 NFL Draft. He was the 4th pick in the 2017 Draft selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars. Fournette was immediately included in the offence as the premier running back and in his first game as a Jaguar he rushed for 100 yards and scored a touchdown. Fournette has continued his performances from college level to the pro level with 740 yards in 8 games with 6 touchdowns and is in top-10 of players with most rushing yards this season. #2 JuJu Smith-Schuster (WR, Pittsburgh Steelers) JuJu Smith-Schuster(19)     Playing in a team boasting the likes of Le'Veon Bell, Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant, chances of anybody else receiving the ball are far and wide but former USC wide-receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster has managed to do the unimaginable by becoming Rothlisberger's secondary receiver behind Brown replacing Bryant. JuJu was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the 62nd pick in the 2nd round of the 2017 NFL Draft. He is the youngest player in the NFL right now at 20 years of age. Considering he was the 3rd receiving option at the start of the season, JuJu failed to register any yards in Steelers season opener against Cleveland. In Week 2, he managed 16 yards on 3 receptions with 1 touchdown, becoming NFL's youngest player to score a touchdown. JuJu's breakout game came in week 8 against the Detroit Lions where he recorded 193 yards on 7 receptions which included a 97-yard touchdown run. As of week 12, JuJu has 568 yards with 5 touchdowns in 10 games at an average of 56.8 yards per game.     #1 Evan Engram (TE, New York Giants) Evan Engram(88) This tight end out of Ole Miss is currently the only bright spot on a team bereft of its best receiver and currently sitting at the bottom of the league table with 2 wins in 10 games. A consensus first-team All-SEC selection with 2,320 yards and 15 touchdowns in his 4 years at Ole Miss, Engram was drafted by the New York Giants with the 23rd pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. Since his introduction into the lineup, Engram has become one of Eli Manning's favourite throwing option averaging 7.8 targets per game. He has responded well to Eli's trust with 5 touchdowns at 4.1 receptions and 56.2 yards per game. Engram has the most touchdowns (5), total yards (452) and receptions (41) among rookie tight ends right now.

The spot has not been in a better situation than 2018 in a long time. The quarterback climate has a perfect mix of veterans and new blood.  The ranking for the quarterback room has taken into account the starter, backup quarterback, scout team QB, supporting cast, offensive system and teams' expected run-to-pass ratio along with past performance and history of injury.        The article ranks the teams by scoring each quarterback and taking the cumulative score as a marker. The third quarterback is only taken into account if they are a viable trade bait or hold any chance to start during the regular season.           #32 Jacksonville Jaguars Starter - Blake Bortles, Backup - Cody Kessler Blake Bortles will try to not let his defense down It is one of the very few quarterback-proof rosters in the NFL. The team will look to lean on the run game in the offense this season. Blake Bortles has to improve his mechanics to move out the bottom of the list and Kessler will need to shake off his winless season with the Browns.     #31 Carolina Panthers Starter - Cam Newton, Backup - Taylor Heinicke Newton will have to become the Superman from 2015 Cam has to be the Superman again under new ownership. Panthers have Taylor Heinicke as their backup. If you are thinking who that person is, you are not alone. #30 Kansas City Chiefs Starter - Pat Mahomes, Backup - Chad Henne Mahomes will have to be the present and future of the squad     Pat Mahomes has not started a relevant game in the NFL. He has potential but Texas Tech's air raid offense is not the best to go by. Chad Henne couldn't beat out Blake Bortles at his worst, which is not the best news for Chiefs faithful. #29 Miami Dolphins Starter - Ryan Tannehill, Backup - Brock Osweiler Tannehill will be playing for his job Brock Osweiler can't be described as the best backup policy for Tannehill, who is coming back from a knee injury last season. The coaching staff is in the hot seat and sharing the division with Patriots does not help.     #28 Washington Redskins Starter - Alex Smith, Backup - Colt McCoy Alex Smith will have to bring his MVP season from Kansas City Alex Smith might live up to his MVPesque season from last time but McCoy would live on as a below average backup QB forever. Alex Smith ain't the worst option after Kirk Cousins left. #27 Houston Texans Starter - Deshaun Watson. Backup - Brandon Weeden Deshaun Watson will have to be the player he was before the injury     Houston has Weeden as their backup to their sophomore superstar coming off an ACL injury, O'Brien would hope for a better option than that. The team hopes to stay fit next season and do some damage in AFC. #26 Dallas Cowboys Starter - Dak Prescott, Backup - Mike White, Cooper Rush Prescott will get his sidekick in Ezekial Elliott back for the season Dak and Zeke form a formidable offense but the Cowboys quarterback room could do better than Mike White and Rush. Jason Garrett must be hoping for Kellen Moore (probably not).     #25 Cincinnati Bengals Starter - Andy Dalton, Backup - Matt Barkley Dalton will have to bemoreconsistent upcoming season Cincinnati Bengals have changes looming in front of them, the coaching staff is in the hot seat and the QB room ain't helping. Andy Dalton has been used to define the term 'average' all over the NFL dictionary and Barkley never lived up to his high school potential. #24 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Starter - Winston, Backup - Ryan Fitzpatrick Tampa Bay will not have Winston for the first 3 weeks per suspension     Winston will serve his ban and Ryan Fitzpatrick will be QB-1 in the depth chart, sounds depressing, probably is. #23 Baltimore Ravens Starter/ Backup - Joe Flacco, Lamar Jackson. The QB competition is in full swing at Ravens camp Ravens' coaching has been immensely impressed with rookie Lamar Jackson. The reports from preseason indicate that Joe Flacco has been showing more initiation as well. Ravens will be looking to capitalize on a soft AFC. #22 Chicago Bears Starter - Mitchell Trubisky, Backup - Chase Daniels Trubisky can lead Bears to playoffs and become the greatest franchise QB     Bears have a new offensive system and Chase Daniel as the backup, who has come from the Chiefs system that Matt Nagy will be running. Trubisky needs to live up to his draft pedigree and Bears can easily jump to the next tier. #21 Buffalo Bills Starter - AJ McCarron, Backup - Josh Allen, Nathan Peterman The team will hope for Josh Allen to win the starting job Bills brought in McCarron from Bengals as an insurance policy to their Rookie, Josh Allen. Bills have an average starter, one raw rookie, and a backup with starting capabilities in Peterman. No one should be surprised if everyone gets a start in Buffalo.     #20 Denver Broncos Starter - Case Keenum, Backup - Paxton Lynch, Chad Kelly Keenum will hop to fill the big shoes of Peyton Manning Case Keenum had a career year last season but he won't have the similar support cast as Minnesota. Paxton Lynch has bust written all over him and won't even command a conditional pick in return. #19 Tennessee Titans Starter - Marcus Mariota, Backup - Blaine Gabbert Mariota needs to bounce back from a dreadful last season     Titans have been a run first team but Mariota needs to improve his play for them to compete against Houston in the division. Gabbert can be a great backup in the correct system with his cannon arm and great mobility. #18 New York Giants Starter - Eli Manning, Backup - Davis Webb/ Kyle Lauletta Eli Manning will have to deliver with the run game to support Eli Manning has lost way too many steps to be a top tier QB but his stellar offensive sidekicks should take him to the belief land. Davis Webb has been making a lot of noise this offseason along with Kyle Lauletta at the backup position.     #17 Oakland Raiders Starter - Derek Carr, Backup - Connor Cooks Derek Carr will have to gel into Gruden's offense sooner than later Derek Carr underachieved last season. Cook and Carr will soon realize that life under Gruden is not as rosy as Gruden Camp. The team has Jeff Fisher vibes of finishing 8-8. #16 Detroit Lions Starter - Matthew Stafford, Backup - Matt Cassel Stafford can rise up to the next level     Stafford has one of the best arm seen in the sport but he needs a better support cast. How does Matt Cassel still have a job in NFL, even though it is as a backup? #15 Atlanta Falcons Starter - Matt Ryan, Backup - Matt Schaub Matt Ryan can bring the Falcons to the top Matt Ryan has had a legendary career till now, without winning the big one. The bad news is that they have Matt Schaub as the backup. #14 New Orleans Saints Starter - Drew Brees, Backup - Tom Savage     Drew Brees will look to take Saints further than last time Saints are moving on to a more run-heavy offense which might help the longevity of Brees. Saints are one of the big boys of NFC and Brees would love to make one last run before father time gets him. Tom Savage is not what you dream of as a backup but Saints don't have an option. Hill is the scout team QB who is turning heads at camp. #13 Seattle Seahawks Starter - Russell Wilson, Backup - Austin Davis     Russell Wilson will look for some help from the run offense Russell Wilson is a one-man offense for Seahawks with zero run game, no O-line help and below par receiving core. Russell Wilson does it all but sadly Austin Davis can't. The diminishing quality of Seahawks defense makes their chances of playoff dim. #12 Los Angeles Rams LA Rams - Starter - Jared Goff, Backup - Sean Mannion Goff will look to improve on his stellar performance last season     Jared Goff took a big leap last season. Sean McVay has been a godsend to Rams offense. Sean Mannion is not the best backup option but he has been in the system and a good subordinate to the young future of Los Angeles. Goff is a sneaky MVP candidate with Gurley by the sides. #11 Pittsburgh Steelers Starter - Roethlisberger, Backup - Mason Rudolph/ Landry Jones Roethlisberger will look to capitalize on Bell's last year in Pittsburgh Steelers have a complete offense led by Big Ben. His two quarterback understudies are raw and with minimal arm talent. Roethlisberger has been injured in bits and pieces over the last few seasons and the weak backup situation doesn't help the Steelers.     #10 Los Angeles Chargers Starter - Rivers, Backup - Geno Smith/ Cardale Jones Rivers will be looking for some luck and support from the fans Rivers is a great starter with a competent backup in Geno Smith. The run game led by Melvin Gordon with the receiving talent of Keenan Allen would be a handful for any defense. If the team stays fit, they can be a challenger for the AFC title. #09 San Francisco 49ers Starter - Jimmy Garoppolo, Backup - CJ Bethard Jimmy G will look to become Jimmy GQ     Garoppolo ended the 49ers season last year with 5 wins. The only way for the 49ers is up. Kyle Shanahan has one of the most sophisticated offenses in the league. CJ Bethard as the backup is a little suspect. Bay area is waiting for Jimmy G to become Jimmy Jesus. #8 Cleveland Browns Starter - Tyrod Taylor, Backup - Baker Mayfield/ Drew Stanton Baker and Tyrod will look to bring back the glory at Cleveland Browns were the worst team in Football but they have added to every position on the pitch. Taylor is a dependable QB, who can give you 5 wins on his worst day. Baker is the future with great football ethics and Drew Stanton will be a great third QB while developing a rookie. Browns look like a sneaky break out team for the upcoming season.     #07 Green Bay Packers Starter - Aaron Rodgers, Backup - DeShone Kizer Rodgers will be without his favorite wide receiver next season Rodgers has been known to hide most of the blemishes of his team. Packers traded for Kizer to be the backup, who was the QB of a 16 loss team. The addition of Jimmy Graham at tight end position will come as a great help after Nelson left. #06 New England Patriots Starter - Tom Brady, Backup - Brian Hoyer/ Danny Etling Brady will look to defy father time for one more season     Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time. Brian Hoyer is definitely not the greatest backup quarterback of all time. Brady's age is a sign of trouble but he is the reigning MVP of the league. Patriots have drafted Danny Etling in the late rounds who could turn up to be a great option for the future. #05 Indianapolis Colts Starter - Andrew Luck, Backup - Jacoby Brissett Luck finally looks set to be back alongside promising backup in Brissett If Andrew Luck wasn't coming back from injury, Colts could have been the top team in this exercise. Brissett has been a great trade by Colts. Luck has started training again and the revamped offensive line won't hurt either. The future looks bright for the franchise.     #04 New York Jets Starter/ Backup - Darnold, Josh McCown, Bridgewater Jets will have one of the most balanced quarterback room No one expected Jets to end up this high on the list but they have a great experienced starter and teacher in Josh McCown. They arguably got the best quarterback from the recent draft in Sam Darnold and they signed Teddy Bridgewater for free in the offseason. Bridgewater is the biggest trade asset in the league and front-runner for the comeback player of the year. Jets have stability at the position for the first time in a long time.     #03 Minnesota Vikings Starter - Kirk Cousins, Backup - Trevor Siemian Cousins will be expected to live up to his price tag The future looks bright for the franchise. Kirk Cousins is underrated even after being the costliest player in football and Siemian is as good a backup as any. Vikings will try to make the run in a loaded NFC. #02 Arizona Cardinals Starter - Sam Bradford, Backup - Josh Rosen/ Mike Glennon Rosen will look to earn the starts while Bradford needs to stay fit     The Cardinals have one of the most polished QB coming out of College in Rosen. Sam Bradford can be a top 15 quarterback when fit. The quarterback room compliments each other, unlike any other team. Cardinals can shock a lot of people next season. #01 Philadelphia Eagles Starter - Carson Wentz, Backup - Nick Foles Eagles would love another Philly special, with Wentz this time Nick Foles just won Philly the Superbowl, while the future MVP of the league (Wentz) was sidelined with an injury. Eagles have things sorted till Foles gets traded for too many draft picks. The Eagles QB room might just help them reach the mountaintop again. The in-depth look into every quarterback room made me realize that Matt Cassel, Matt Schaub, and Landry Jones will keep having backup jobs in 2096 and no one will ever notice. In conclusion. my biggest fear is that Blake Bortles will end up winning the Superbowl and make this article as irrelevant as his throwing motion.

75,Mike Glennon,"['5 best landing spots for Gardner Minshew\xa0  Gardner Minshew was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the sixth round of the 2019 NFL Draft. At the time, he was considered the future quarterback of the franchise, but it seems that time has come and gone.  In 2019, Gardner Minshew became the starting quarterback after Nick Foles was injured in Week 1 of the season. Minshew went on to appear in 14 games, starting 12, throwing for 3,271 yards and 21 touchdowns.        Before the 2020 season, Foles was traded, making Gardner Minshew the starting quarterback for the Jaguars. After Minshew sustained injuries, Mike Glennon and Jake Luton received opportunities to start. When Gardner Minshew returned, the Jaguars weren\'t happy with his performance and replaced him in Week 15 with Mike Glennon.           The Jaguars have now drafted their new starting quarterback,Trevor Lawrence. The team signed former San Francisco 49ers backup C.J. Beathard as the backup, while Jake Luton would be third in the depth chart. That puts Gardner Minshew the odd man out, and the Jacksonville Jaguars are interested in trading him. On that note, let\'s have a look at five NFL teams that could be a good fit for Minshew. Frangie Show: Gardner Minshew was not at #Jaguars voluntary OTAs today. Urban Meyer said he expects him back Monday.""Urban has praised him publicly, but feels like in all likelihood, he\'s not going to be here this year."" - @HaysCarlyon pic.twitter.com/uVcC0i4bHt— 1010 XL / 92.5 FM (@1010XL) June 3, 2021      #1 Tennesse Titans The Tennessee Titans recently traded for wide receiver Julio Jones and have a solid offense that includes quarterback Ryan Tannehill. While Tannehill is the obvious starter in Tennessee, the depth behind him doesn\'t have a lot of experience. DeShone Kizer and Logan Woodside are the current backups to Tannehill. If either were to start in place of Tannehill, their offense might not be able to utilize all of their offensive weapons. So trading for Gardner Minshew would allow the Titans to have a solid, reliable backup quarterback, one who has a big arm and could use his legs if the need be.  #2 Carolina Panthers This off-season, the Carolina Panthers traded Teddy Bridgewater with the Denver Broncos and acquired Sam Darnold from the New York Jets. The Panthers believe offensive coordinator Joe Brady would fix any issues Darnold has had so far in his career. Darnold\'s current backup is PJ Walker, who was not only a solid Temple quarterback but also an XFL one with the Houston Roughnecks. Acquiring Gardner Minshew could be good for the Panthers because if Darnold\'s issues don\'t get resolved, the former could end up becoming their starting quarterback.     REPORT: The Jaguars might accept a 5th or 6th round pick for QB Gardner Minshew. pic.twitter.com/wPeLzhdlLA— JPA Football 🏈 (@jpafootball) June 11, 2021   #3 Indianapolis Colts The Colts traded for Carson Wentz. While they probably won\'t be trading for a backup quarterback, too, especially in their own division, it might be a good idea. Wentz has struggled to stay on the field his entire career because of injuries. The Colts\' current backup quarterback options are Jacob Eason and 2021 draft pick Sam Ehlinger. Both are young and without experience, so if Wentz were to have injury issues again, the Colts would be in a tough bind.      #4 Houston Texans Deshaun Watson\'s situation hasn\'t had any updates lately, so it is not known if or when the quarterback would start the 2021 season. The Texans drafted Davis Mills out of Stanford in this year\'s draft. The Texans also signed Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel as backup options. But with the type of offense the Texans run, Gardner Minshew might be better suited than the above options if Watson is no longer one.#5 Washington Football TeamThe Washington Football Team has added a few key pieces to their offense this off-season. Veteran journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick signed with Washington after spending two seasons with the Miami Dolphins. Fitzpatrick won\'t be the starting quarterback in the long term, so Washington will need another option soon. Gardner Minshew could be that one.     ', ""5 NFL coaches Cardinals could've considered for HC instead of Jonathan Gannon\xa0  The Arizona Cardinals have a new head coach, Jonathan Gannon. The former Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator took on the job just days after taking his team to the Super Bowl. After working in a variety of positions on defense, he now takes his first head coaching job.  It might be a good fit, but he was not the only option available. There were reports that Arizona were trying to get Sean Payton before he chose the Denver Broncos. They interviewed other candidates as well who might have taken this job.        While we wish Gannon all the best, there are a couple of issues that stand out. An example being that the Eagles gave up 38 points in the Super Bowl and suffered some lapses in concentration during the final games of the regular season. Furthermore, with Kyler Murray's situation, maybe an offensive coach might have been better.           Considering such factors, we look at some other candidates the Cardinals could have chosen. Who else would have made sense for the Cardinals? #1 - Dan Quinn, DC, Dallas Cowboys NFC Divisional Playoffs - Dallas Cowboys v San Francisco 49ers     If the Cardinals wanted a defensive-minded coach like Jonathan Gannon, they could have looked at Dan Quinn instead. While Philadelphia allowed fewer yards per game, their points allowed was not as good as that of the Dallas Cowboys. While the difference was marginal (with the Eagles defense allowing 20.2 points per game compared to 20.1 for Dallas), Philadelphia was playing with Jalen Hurts, who did not turn the ball over with the frequency of Dak Prescott. That could have been a convincing argument to hire Quinn. However, he also has a head coaching pedigree, something Gannon does not. He took the Atlanta Falcons to the Super Bowl. At the time, he ensured that even though he came from a defensive standpoint, the offense flourished with Matt Ryan being named league MVP that season. Considering the situation in Arizona, where they need a coach who can develop Kyler Murray, this might have been a very good fit.     #2 - Eric Bienemy, OC, Kansas City Chiefs If one was looking for an offensive play-caller who has the resume to beat anybody else, it would have to be Eric Bienemy at the moment. He has been with the Kansas City Chiefs since 2018 and has won two Super Bowls. Bienemy has worked magic with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce and ensured that their offense flourishes even without Tyreek Hill this season.

The veteran coach gets credit for the play calls. However, considering that the Cardinals desperately need to figure out how best to use Kyler Murray, an offensive-minded coach like him could have been an asset.     #3 - Brian Flores, DC, Minnesota Vikings Pittsburgh Steelers v Miami Dolphins Brian Flores is the newly minted defensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings. He spent a year in Pittsburgh after his departure from the Miami Dolphins, but he now has a position in Minnesota. He was reported to have been interviewed for the job in Arizona. While Jonathan Gannon has done an amazing job this season, he does not have head coaching experience. That is something Flores had with Miami. He also had the job of handling a young quarterback there, who he had to mentor and help grow. He has been in that situation before as a head coach and might have risen to the occasion with the Cardinals.     #4 - Mike Kafka, OC, New York Giants In this year's NFL honors, the Coach of the Year award went to Brian Daboll. Not many would argue with it given where the New York Giants were a year ago compared to them making it to the Divisional round this season. One of the main reasons for their improvement was the increased maturity shown by quarterback Daniel Jones. Much of that credit should go to Mike Kafka, who oversees the offense there. felix 🇵🇷@FootballPapiNews coming through as I'm at work: Jonthan Gannon getting the Cardinals job means that #Giants OC Mike Kafka returns and gets another year with Daniel Jones. Exciting news that the NFL Coach of the Year gets to retain two of his biggest staff members. #TogetherBlue DJ gets… twitter.com/i/web/status/1…News coming through as I'm at work: Jonthan Gannon getting the Cardinals job means that #Giants OC Mike Kafka returns and gets another year with Daniel Jones. Exciting news that the NFL Coach of the Year gets to retain two of his biggest staff members. #TogetherBlue DJ gets… twitter.com/i/web/status/1…     He has experience mentoring Patrick Mahomes in his initial years and has now turned Daniel Jones from being a near-bust to a good quarterback. This is someone who could have been just the right person to take Kyler Murray's development to the next stage. #5 - Steve Wilks, DC, San Francisco 49ers Denver Broncos v Carolina Panthers One can see why the Cardinals went with a defensive coach like Gannon. Despite needing someone to cajole the best performance out of Kyler Murray, another worry was their defense. They shipped 26.2 points per game, the second-worst in the league behind the Chicago Bears.     When confronted with this dual problem, the best person based on current record should have been Steve Wilks. He was the interim head coach of the Carolina Panthers and turned around a team that had looked hopeless all season. He suddenly got Sam Darnold looking like a real quarterback. He also tightened the defense and improved the run game. He showed his all-round caliber. The obvious issue with this choice would have been his previous history with the Cardinals, where he finished 3-13 in the 2018 season. However, that was before Kyler Murray was drafted and he had to manage with Mike Glennon and Josh Rosen.Considering his familiarity with the Cardinals and given both he and the team were in a different situation then, this could have been a possible, albeit unusual, option.     "", '3 unlikely MVP candidates for the 2022 NFL season feat. Mac Jones  As we approach the 2022 NFL season, the preseason hype is building for the usual MVP candidates such as the two-time defending winner Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes.  Hype is also there for unusual names. Several surprising names could be due for a massive NFL season in 2022, challenging our prexisiting perception of who can win the award. So, here are three unlikely MVP candidates for the 2022 NFL season                   Matt Ryan could have all the pieces around him needed to excel in 2022 Matt Ryan After suffering unfathomable heartbreak practically handing away the Lombardi Trophy with the Atlanta Falcons during Super Bowl LI, Matt Ryan is making his way to Indianapolis with plenty of unfinished business. The Colts moved on from Carson Wentz after a tenuous fit last season. But with Ryan, a once proud franchise may have found the missing piece to lift a talented core of skill position players on offense over the top.        NFL.com\'s Adam Schein sees Ryan as the answer for Indy and listed him as one of his dark horse sleeper candidates for MVP. Ryan has more talent around him than he\'s had in many years, if ever. The 2016 NFL MVP has a chance to get back to that level in a new home that\'s far more conducive to winning than his old home ever was.  Will Kirk Cousins finally prove worthy of his gaudy salary? Kirk Cousins Could 2022 finally be the year Kirk Cousins puts forth a performance under center that is worthy of the enormous payday he receives year in and year out for the Minnesota Vikings?     It\'s possible, with former GM Rick Spielman and head coach Mike Zimmer, a defensive-minded game manager, fired and replaced with Kevin O’Connell in the Twin Cities.

Mike Glennon Cousins is entering his fifth year with the Vikings, and things have been going in the wrong direction the last few NFL seasons. This feels like a turning point season for the 33-year-old.  Mac Jones is a popular dark horse candidate in 2022     Mac Jones Mac Jones\' improved physique has many seeing the Nick Saban-coached Alabama product heading into his second NFL season as the starting signal-caller in New England. Jones had a surprisingly effective rookie season. He led the Patriots to the post-season for the first time in the post-Tom Brady era, completing 67.6 percent of his passes for 3,801 yards, 22 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions. ESPN analyst Mike Tannenbaum, former New York Jets GM from 2006 to 2012, sung Jones\' and the Patriots\' praises during an appearance on Get Up! ""This is a team with two great running backs, two great tight ends, a really good offensive line and, in my opinion, a slightly underrated wide receiver corps. ""So, I think the CEO of Bill Belichick will manage his team, they\'ll have a great kicking game like always, and I think they have a young superstar at the quarterback position, who led the team last year to the playoffs, and they scored more points than the Patriots did with Tom Brady the year before.""     Mike Reiss@MikeReissMike T all-in on Mac Jones (via @GetUpESPN).90570Mike T all-in on Mac Jones (via @GetUpESPN). https://t.co/je9mIvQzab With a proven HC in Bill Belichick capable of coaching a QB built for his system - Cam Newton was the wrong guy at the wrong time in 2020 - Mac Jones is in one of the most ready-made systems for his talents, just like he was at Alabama.It was always a safe bet that Jones would improve in 2022 as he got more reps in at the pro level. But his work on his body is what could be the impetus to MVP-level improvement.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Get Up! and H/T Sportskeeda     ', ""Giants' Kadarius Toney ejected for throwing punch\xa0  The NFC East's most talented team put on a show in Week 5 as the Dallas Cowboys humbled the New York Giants 44-20 at AT&T Stadium. Dak Prescott had an efficient game, throwing for 302 yards and three touchdowns with just one interception.  On the other hand, the Giants suffered more than just a defeat. The team also saw some of their key players pick up significant injuries.        Giants quarterback Daniel Jones suffered a concussion as he was attempting to cross the goal-line. Saquan Barkley was also carted off with a severe ankle injury. Even first-year Giants receiver Kenny Golladay suffered a knee injury and may miss time.           To add insult to injury, Giants rookie wide receiver Kadarius Toney was ejected for punching Cowboys safety Damontae Kazee. Bobby Skinner@BobbySkinner_Kadarius Toney swinging on dudes 😂7:09 AM · Oct 10, 20211834223Kadarius Toney swinging on dudes 😂 https://t.co/s3NI8r7ZvG Giants' Kadarius Toney gets ejected for punching Cowboys safety     The play occurred after Toney caught a 13-yard pass and fought for more yardage when Kazee finished the play by tossing Toney to the ground. It was clear that Toney took offense to it and the Cowboys and Giants tried to come between the two players to diffuse the situation. As Kazee and New York Giants tight end Evan Engram were engulfed in what appeared to be a shouting match, Kadrius Toney decided to take a swing at Kazee's helmet and connected. The referee immediately threw a penalty flag and ejected Toney. Can the Giants save their season? Toney's ejection overshadowed his excellent performance on the night, where he broke former Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr.'s rookie receiving record of 185 yards. Toney finished the game with 189 receiver yards. This will have to be the silver lining in a Giants season that appears to be derailing at a frantic pace. The Giants' franchise running back and best player, Saquon Barkley, is now facing another injury as he was still working his way back from a torn ACL.     Front Man@Notufatjesus_#Giants7:39 AM · Oct 10, 202132#Giants https://t.co/Z5vohZL7NwWith the loss of Barkley, Daniel Jones and Kenny Golladay, the Giants will now turn to backup quarterback Mike Glennon and Kadarius Toney to try and save the season.     "", ""NFL teams with negative passing yards in a game: Giants finish with -10 passing yards vs. Bears  The New York Giants finished Sunday's game against the Chicago Bears with negative passing yards. New York had arguably one of the worst games during the day's NFL action.   Things couldn't have gone any worse as they were completely dismantled by Chicago. The final score was 29-3, and the Bears had their way with the Giants in every aspect of the game.         One of the most embarrassing stats for the Giants was that the Giants ended the contest with -10 passing yards. Oddly enough, this is not the first time a team has ended up with negative passing yards in a game.           Here are five NFL games in which a team ended up with negative passing yards. Which NFL game had the most negative passing yards? #5 - Houston Texans vs. Oakland Raiders (Texans, -5 passing yards) The Houston Texans and the Oakland Raiders battled it out in the 2006 season. Although the game would ultimately be won by the Texans, they ended the game with -5 passing yards. David Carr went 7/14 for 32 yards, which ultimately led to a -5 passing yard situation for the team. The Texans rode the prowess with their two defensive touchdowns and a strong rushing performance from Ron Dayne to secure a 23-14 win.     #4 - New England Patriots vs. Tennessee Titans (Titans, -7 passing yards) There should be little surprise here as the New England Patriots were dominant nearly every season when Tom Brady was running things. The game in 2009 saw the Patriots take on the Tennessee Titans and completely dominate them with a final score of 59-0. Bernd Buchmasser@BerndBuchmasserThe Titans were the last team to gain negative passing yards: they had -7 while getting blown out 59-0 by the Patriots in 2009. twitter.com/SBNation/statu…SB Nation@SBNationYou had more passing yards today than the New York Giants1:22 AM · Jan 2, 202273You had more passing yards today than the New York Giants https://t.co/j2EpVjNCXwThe Titans were the last team to gain negative passing yards: they had -7 while getting blown out 59-0 by the Patriots in 2009. twitter.com/SBNation/statu… The Patriots did all of this without logging a single sack. Vince Young went 0/2 on the day and Kerry Collins went 2/12 for -7 passing yards. An embarrassing day for the Titans.     #3 - Cleveland Browns vs. Jacksonville Jaguars (Browns, -9 passing yards) The Cleveland Browns were once the worst organization in the entire league. They proved that in 2000 when they were completely humbled by the Jacksonville Jaguars. The final score was 48-0 in favor of the Jaguars. The Browns quarterback situation was as messy as it could get. Spergon Wynn, Doug Pederson and Kevin Thompson all attempted passing situations that ultimately led to a -9 passing yards stat line for the team. #2 - New York Giants vs. Chicago Bears - (Giants, -10 passing yards) Sunday's game between the New York Giants and the Chicago Bears saw the Giants suffer embarrassment from the defensive prowess of their rivals. The first play of the game resulted in a fumble from Mike Glennon. The next series ended up being an interception. SB Nation@SBNationYou had more passing yards today than the New York Giants1:20 AM · Jan 2, 20222805487You had more passing yards today than the New York Giants https://t.co/j2EpVjNCXw     Glennon had an incredibly tough day resulting in a -10 passing yards situation that now lands New York on a list they never wanted to be a part of. #1 - San Deigo Chargers vs. Kansas City Chiefs (Chargers, -19 passing yards) Divisional games are always tough for one of the teams involved. Back when the Chargers were still in San Diego, they were destroyed by divisional rival Kansas City Chiefs. The game happened in the 1998 season, and the final score was 23-7, in favor of the Chiefs.Ryan Leaf was never a hugely accepted candidate at quarterback for the Chargers, and his 1/15 and four-yard performance didn't help matters at all. The final passing yard stat would be -19 passing yards. That is one of the worst cases of negative passing yards to ever happen.     "", ""NFL trade rumours: 5 players unlikely to return to the NY Giants for the 2021-22 season  It's a high-pressure year for the New York Giants, and the message to Dave Gettleman is clear: playoffs or unemployment. The fact that Gettleman wasn't fired after the 2020 season was a surprise, but there's no longer any excuse for him if the Giants don't make the playoffs this year.  The team invested heavily in free agency to give Daniel Jones potent weapons to work some magic and the Giants now need to turn their attention towards the salary cap. Some well-known players could be on their way out in the next few weeks.        Five New York Giants players likely on their way out           #1 - Nate Solder, OT Nate Solder is one of the Giants' biggest recent mistakes, signing in 2018 to become the NFL's highest-paid offensive lineman. Since signing on the dotted line, Solder's performance has fallen way short of expectations and his opt-out because of the pandemic in 2020 has hindered the Giants from shipping out his contract. Solder will not be cut. There's a $13.5 million dead cap on the remaining two years on his contract and the Giants can't take such a big loss. But Andrew Thomas and Matt Peart are two options able to protect the ends of the offensive line, which means Solder is a trade candidate right now. #2 - Kelvin Benjamin, WR/TE Nobody knows what Kelvin Benjamin is right now. He worked as a tight end during minicamp, but the Giants have him listed as a wide receiver. Whatever his official designation, it doesn't look like he'll be on the team for long.     Not even his proximity to Dave Gettleman, who drafted him for the Carolina Panthers, can help Benjamin revive his NFL career. He'll be one of the cuts for the Giants to close the 53-man roster. TD on Kelvin Benjamin being the biggest What If in Carolina: 1/ “He was the guy that could’ve totally rewritten the record books if he would’ve fully committed himself to being in shape all the time, making sure that he was a true professional.— BobbiHatesThings (@notwhiskeybobbi) July 11, 2021 #3 - John Ross, WR John Ross caught the eye even before he was picked in the draft by breaking the record for the fastest 40-yard dash in combine history. Since then, his career has taken a nosedive: Ross was almost always injured during his Cincinnati Bengals days and has failed to live up to the expectations of being a top-10 pick.     With more established names at the top of the rotation, his spot is up for grabs along with Dante Pettis, who has also failed to make a name for himself. The difference between the two is that while Pettis isn't as fast as Ross, he's had less trouble staying healthy in his career and can play on special teams. Ross probably won't survive the cuts. Sam Beal couldn't stay healthy during his Giants career  #4 - Sam Beal, CB Since we're talking about players who can't stay healthy, Sam Beal is another name whose job is in jeopardy. Picked in the supplemental draft in 2018, Beal didn't play as a rookie due to injuries or in 2020 because he opted out.     Some notables who practiced and weren’t around for voluntary OTAs were Sam Beal, Logan Ryan, Xavier McKinney, Jabrill Peppers and some others.— Jordan Raanan (@JordanRaanan) June 8, 2021 In the only year he played in the NFL, 2019, he also went through the injury reserve for a hamstring injury. Most likely, the Giants will admit they made a mistake and let him go, especially after he ran into some legal issues last month. #5 - Clayton Thorson, QB Thorson, a former Northwestern star, failed to make his NFL career take off. After stints with the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys, he found some stability on the Giants' practice squad in 2020.With Daniel Jones and Mike Glennon securing their places on the team, Thorson will likely not survive the cuts to the 53-man roster. He could, however, find a spot on the practice squad. Unsure about a trade offer?

The franchise finished rock bottom in the NFC East and often looked out of sorts. In their final 10 games, the offense could only muster 26 points as they were soundly beaten far too often.    With Daniel Jones suffering a neck injury in Week 12, Mike Glennon was thrust into the starting job, and his performance was severely underwhelming. With the organization not picking up Jones\' fifth-year option, he is now in the final year of his rookie deal with his future murky at best.     As for Slayton, the receiver played 13 games, but only started five and fell well short of his receiving yards totals from his first two seasons. The 25-year-old ended 2021 with just 26 receptions for only 339 yards and two touchdowns.   With so many unknowns heading into the offseason for New York, one thing is for certain, if they want to avoid another disastrous year, they need to solve their quarterback problems.     ', '5 best Rich Eisen rants about the New York Jets  Rich Eisen often says, ‘You can’t spell fanatic without fan.’ He himself has been guilty of letting his emotions out on his broadcasts, particularly when ranting about his beloved New York Jets.  Eisen is a consummate broadcaster, but get him talking about New York sports and you’re in for a treat.        His passion comes through in abundance, as does his subject knowledge. What makes his rants so remarkable is both the rarity in which they occur and the emotion they are delivered with. In an era of sports talk shows being judged on who can shout the loudest, Eisen’s meltdowns are relatable and make sense.           He isn’t looking for a clip to go viral, he simply can’t contain his New York Jets-based distress. Whilst the Jets are gradually improving in areas away from the quarterback position, success still eludes the franchise. Much to his frustration, he often has to talk about these near-misses or complete fiascos. But which of Rich Eisen’s 5 most infamous New York Jets rants are the best?  #5 New York Jets slip to 0-13 New York Jets hiring Adam Gase wasn\'t a popular move     The 2020 season wasn’t a good one for the New York Jets, and Rich Eisen felt every second of the pain that came with a 0-13 start to the campaign. Adam Gase was a coach that the media personality never got on board with. However, even Eisen wasn’t even prepared for the disastrous result against the Seattle Seahawks that left the Jets 0-13. To put this rant into context, Jamal Adams was Eisen’s favorite player, but was traded to Seattle earlier in the season. “I’m a 51-year-old man and I’ve been rooting for the Jets for as long as I can remember, I don’t recall anything worse than Sunday,” Eisen despaired on the Rich Eisen Show. “Just to rub salt in the wound, let’s put Geno Smith in there to finish it up. The Jets are that casino handing out chips to everybody. I could not handle it.     “I sat there, I was literally looking for a poop sandwich right around me, because that’s what I was eating. It was dreadful, it was terrible, it was unacceptable.”  Unfortunately for Eisen, the 2020 NFL season would provide him further pain… but more on that later.  #4 Jets lose 54-13 to the New England Patriots Robert Saleh has quickly grown used to Jets\' pain Robert Saleh’s arrival in the Big Apple was supposed to usher in an era of defensive solidity for the New York Jets.     Yet, in his first season, the Jets suffered a shocking 54-13 defeat to their fiercest rivals, the New England Patriots. Zach Wilson suffered an injury in the second quarter whilst Mac Jones completed a season sweep over the Jets as a rookie. Speaking after the game, Rich Eisen said: “It gives me no pleasure to come on a national telecast like this and tell the team that means so much to me that… you stink. The team stinks right now and I feel for all my fellow Jet fans, especially the ones who year-in year-out renew their excitement and faith.  “I always hope for the best. I will not allow myself to get run away with excitement, but even a part of me thought that when the Jets drafted Zach Wilson and the Patriots drafted Mac Jones, a part of me thought that this would be the time it finally turns.”     He emphatically concluded: “The Jets are back at square zero and its infuriating.”  #3 Gregg Williams’ defensive disaster The phrase \'zero-blitz\' sends shivers down the spine of Jets fans Rich Eisen loves the New York Jets, but there is only so much incompetence he can handle. Jim Maisano@JimMaisanoEvery Jets fan should watch this Rich Eisen video. It\'s classic and on point. You can share his pain. We are a franchise with many pathetic moments and we can add last night\'s joke of performance to list. twitter.com/MMehtaSports/s…Manish Mehta@MMehtaSportsLifelong Jets fan Rich Eisen: “The Broncos were like, ‘Let’s get the hell off the field, because these people are LUNATICS!’”A fantastic recap and worth your time:31Lifelong Jets fan Rich Eisen: “The Broncos were like, ‘Let’s get the hell off the field, because these people are LUNATICS!’”A fantastic recap and worth your time: https://t.co/lgMpa0to9EEvery Jets fan should watch this Rich Eisen video. It\'s classic and on point. You can share his pain. We are a franchise with many pathetic moments and we can add last night\'s joke of performance to list. twitter.com/MMehtaSports/s…     He took a striking dislike to defensive coordinator Gregg Williams. This culminated in an astonishing rant once the coach presided over what has since been labeled as the ""worst defensive play of all time"" back in 2020. Eisen\'s rant came after Williams called for a Cover Zero in a game against the Las Vegas Raiders, with the Jets leading by four points with 15 seconds to go. Raiders wide receiver Henry Ruggs went onto record a game-winning 46-yard score. After the game, Eisen said: “I’m a total mess, I’m rooting for Mike Glennon and Derek Carr at the same time. What is happening? Then Gregg Williams to the rescue. Normally when you’re preventing a Hail Mary you put everyone in the endzone, it’s basic. This is the time to do it… but the Jets decide to blitz.      “Gregg Williams sent eight men at the quarterback. You have this lunatic running your defense in Gregg Williams. He’s absolutely going to call the worst defense imaginable.”  #2 Jets lose to the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2022 Zach Wilson was Rich Eisen’s great hope for the New York Jets, but by the end of his second season with the team, fans are ready to move on. from him Wilson was booed to the bench in a disastrous 19-3 defeat to the Jacksonville Jaguars which virtually condemned the Jets to another year without the playoffs. Putting up just three points at home against Trevor Lawrence and the Jags was was especially painful for the host of the Rich Eisen Show. He said: “All year long I try to say it’s not the same old Jets. They have a bunch of lionhearted kids on the team, but it’s so difficult to watch a four-game losing streak materialize when the season looked so promising.     “Once again this is a New York Jets season we can do a post-mortem on.  “It’s way too steep a climb. What do the Jets do with Zach Wilson? How do you discard a #2 selection after just 21 starts? How do you admit you want to cut your losses? These are all questions that the Jets are going to face. I have my own answers to those questions, obviously.”  #1 Jets miss out on Trevor Lawrence Hey Siri... show me New York Jets pain     Rich Eisen spoke for every single NFL fan when he agonized over his beloved New York Jets failing to ensure Trevor Lawrence joined them. Eisen previously described Lawrence as the best quarterback to emerge since Andrew Luck. He then watched as his Jets recorded defeat after defeat to put themselves in a great position to end up with the first-overall pick in the 2021 draft.

Yet they somehow defeated the high-flying Los Angeles Rams for their first win of the season.     This win should have been greeted with joy, but it virtually meant that New York wouldn’t be getting Lawrence… and it was perhaps too hard a blow for Eisen. “DO NOT GET ME STARTED. This now leaves the Jets on the outside looking in. “It was the most Jet thing of all. I need therapy. My child yesterday, aged nine, asks me if I’m so so so upset that the Jets won today? I said to him, yes, I am.”Rich Eisen had several such moments over the course of that season. However, this was one New York Jets fiasco too far and he provided us with one of the greatest televised rants in sports history.     ', ""Ranking all the starting QBs in USFL 2022 season  The USFL is relaunching in 2022 and the action kicks off this weekend with one game on Saturday night and a trio of games on Sunday. All USFL games will be played in Birmingham, Alabama, though there are eight teams from eight different cities (including Birmingham).  We've taken a look at the coaching picture for this new league and, in this article, we'll be examining each quarterback situation across the new (and hopefully permanent) pro football spring league. Here are all eight USFL QBs for the 2022 season, ranked.                   Jordan Ta'amu actually replaced USFL QB Shea Patterson at Ole Miss #8 - De'Andre Johnson, New Jersey Generals The New Jersey Generals are behind the 8-ball during the 2022 season with an uninspiring De'Andre Johnson under center. He's by far the worst USFL QB of the eight. Johnson has never stuck anywhere he's gone, and twice had to transfer to a lower prestige conference during his NCAA career. His experience in 'The Spring League' didn't amount to much, and that was the last time we saw the QB injury replacement on the field.      #7 - Bryan Scott, Philadelphia Stars Coming from the Division III level, Bryan Scott has always had to fight perception during his NFL career. Scott has been able to carve out a journeyman career that has helped him see the country. His issue is getting to see time on the field. Besides 'The Spring League', Scott has played in the CFL, but a true opportunity to shine has never materialized. After fighting to get a seat at a table dominated by the Power Five conferences, Occidental's own has a chance to change the narrative once again of what a D3 QB can accomplish.  #6 - Jordan Ta'amu, Tampa Bay Bandits Jordan Ta'amu was set to star in the XFL before the entire operation was shut down in 2020 due to measures put in place to combat COVID-19. While the league is returning next season, Ta'amu hopes to be on an NFL roster after stints with five different teams.     Fun fact: Jordan Ta'amu replaced fellow USFL QB Shea Patterson of the Michigan Panthers at Ole Miss for QB1 in 2017. Kyle Lauletta made the FCS to NFL jump before becoming a USFL QB #5 - Kyle Lauletta, Pittsburgh Maulers Kyle Lauletta almost instanteously blew his NFL opportunity by being charged with the following laundry list of missteps: eluding the police, a third-degree crime, obstructing administration of law, and resisting arrest. But that's not all! He also faced motor vehicle charges for reckless driving, disregarding an officer's directions, an improper turn in a marked traffic lane, and failure to remain in a marked lane.     He went on to play with the New York Giants for two years despite all this happening before he played in his first NFL game. Finding NFL work has never been hard for Lauletta despite his reckless behavior. He could clinch future NFL journeyman backup QB status by showing he can dominate USFL competition.  #4 - Kyle Soter, New Orleans Breakers Kyle Soter is the QB for those that never give up on a dream. From white-collar worker to NFL QB in the blink of an eye, Soter decided to stick with the pig-skin instead of pursuing a career in finance and see where it'd take him. It's taken him to several different NFL franchises, but stability hasn't been found just quite yet. Like all other QBs joining the relaunched USFL, a springboard to a more consistent opportunity is the goal.  #3 - Clayton Thorson, Houston Gamblers     Clayton Thorson Just last season, Clayton Thorson was on the New York Giants roster. But he never seriously threatened Daniel Jones or Mike Glennon for any snaps under center. The Northwestern product isn't a big-time playmaker, but he is a beacon of consistency. Twice, the Wildcats won 10 games in the Big Ten, and they went 3-1 in bowl games during his time in Evanston.  #2 - Alex McGough, Birmingham Stallions Alex McGough was a stud at Florida International, earning himself an NFL contract and seventh-round draft selection from the Seahawks. He was the first QB drafted by Seattle since Russell Wilson and is the only QB since.     McGough, like Thorson, was a four-year starter. Unlike Thorson, McGough had to help turn around a program that was cellar-dwelling in the Conference USA before he got there.  #1 - Paxton Lynch, Michigan Panthers Paxton Lynch has by far the highest pedigree of any USFL QB in the 2022 season, and it isn't particularly close. Lynch was a starter for the Denver Broncos and was a first-round NFL Draft pick in 2016. His star has fallen since his time in the NFL, last playing for the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriders but never appearing in a game. The USFL can legitimately propel Lynch higher than the rest of his QB camrades.    Poll : Will you be watching the USFL in 2022?

76,DeShone Kizer,"['Ranking the 10 Worst NFL QBs of the 2010s  Quarterback is the most important position in the NFL and that won’t change for as long as the sport is played.  Over the past decade, we’ve seen some simply stupendous players throw the ball in the NFL, keeping fans astounded on a weekly basis. They impressed one and all with their feats of magic with the ball in their hands.        Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson have all but revolutionised their positions since being drafted, yet not every player can have such a positive impact. As is impossible to avoid, for every success story in the NFL, there is an equally negative outcome for another individual.           The 2010s saw some quite awful quarterback play from a number of guilty parties. Some were so bad that an infamous play is now named after them, whilst others failed to live up to expectations due to an out-of-control off-field life.  Who were the 10 worst NFL quarterbacks of the 2010s? #10 Geno Smith Baltimore Ravens v New York Jets     Geno Smith had talent at the quarterback position, but describing his career in the NFL as a negative snowball would be an understatement. However, it\'s not entirely his fault that he arrived at a poor New York Jets team that was bereft of leadership and veteran presence who were used to winning. After being drafted in the second round of the 2013 NFL Draft, Smith would hugely struggle with interceptions in his first two years, throwing a grand total of 34. He didn’t inspire any confidence within the locker room either. This ultimately culminated in an unfortunate incident. His own teammate, IK Enemkpali, broke his jaw with a right hook that left Smith out injured for most of the 2015 season. He never regained his place, and has since gone onto become a backup option with the Giants, Chargers and Seahawks. But in terms of quarterback production, Smith stands as one of the worst of the 2010s.      #9 Blaine Gabbert Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Jacksonville Jaguars Thrown into the dumpster fire that has been Jacksonville football for the best part of a decade, Blaine Gabbert has had a forgetful NFL career. It is worth nothing, however, that he is classed as a Super Bowl winner. Gabbert rode Tom Brady’s coattails to a championship in Tampa Bay, throwing a grand total of 27 passes in three years. But he remains one of the most disappointing picks of the previous decade. Picked 10th overall in the 2011 NFL Draft, Gabbert had a below average rookie year where he threw just 12 touchdown passes, as well as 11 interceptions. He was also sacked 40 times and fumbled the ball on 14 occasions.     It was a setback that he never recovered from, with the Jacksonville Jaguars never really having patience with him as a long-term starter again.  #8 Mark Sanchez New England Patriots v New York Jets Picked up by the New York Jets with the fifth overall pick in 2009, Mark Sanchez was supposed to save NFL football in the Big Apple. Instead, he is somehow remembered the most for his ""butt-fumble."" Ironically, the four years he had as a starter in New York were four of the better years the Jets have had for a long time. They had a strong roster that just needed a better quarterback. Sanchez made too many mistakes, some at the costliest moments, and that became his legacy.     He never finished a season with the Jets without at least nine fumbles. The butt-fumble was the worst of the lot. Not only did Sanchez misread what the play was supposed to be, but he didn’t have the awareness to know where his own O-Line were positioned. While attempting to slide to safety to avoid Vince Wilfork, he slid into the backside of one of the O-Line members, fumbling the ball in the process. Tobey MaCrier@shaneysmalls@BarstoolPhilly The Sanchez Butt Fumble@BarstoolPhilly The Sanchez Butt Fumble https://t.co/I9DqLmnCEW New York soon lost patience and Sanchez was out, with a specific QB training session called ""The Sanchez Program"" to eliminate QB fumbles being created.      #7 Jake Locker Tennessee Titans v Houston Texans The 2011 NFL Draft saw another QB taken earlier, with Jake Locker going to the Tennessee Titans at #8. When an NFL career lasts four seasons, with a player being a nailed-on starter in just one of them, that tells you everything you need to know. Locker was a backup in his rookie year and was then chosen to lead the Titans in his second year. In 11 starts, he threw for more interceptions than touchdowns and fumbled the ball four times.     Injuries followed, but Locker couldn’t escape the poor performances when he was on the field. He retired in 2015 citing a loss of passion for the sport, cementing his place as one of the biggest busts of the 2010s.  #6 Brandon Weeden Cleveland Browns v Denver Broncos Another name on the lengthy list of Cleveland Browns QB failures, Brandon Weeden arrived in 2012 as the 22nd pick at 28 years of age. His professional MLB career began with the New York Yankees in 2002, yet just a decade later he was in the NFL.     You have to commend the work ethic, but his career in professional football went exactly as you’d expect. He started 15 games as a rookie, throwing 14 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. These stats are alarming, but nowhere near as bad as some on this list. However, he just lacked the pop needed to survive in the NFL. His passes were simply not accurate enough and he was never going to take the team to the next level. Weeden\'s poor displays saw him constantly benched throughout his second year in Cleveland, and he was released at the end of the 2012 season.  #5 Christian Ponder Minnesota Vikings v Green Bay Packers     The sample size of Christian Ponder as an NFL quarterback is admittedly much larger than that of others on this list. But that just purely gives us more evidence to understand how bad he was. Given the starting job in Minnesota for three seasons after being drafted 12th overall in 2011, Ponder’s returns were woeful. His entire career with the Vikings ended with 38 touchdowns and 36 interceptions, as well as 20 fumbles. Ponder struggled to read defenses, even three years into life in the NFL, and he panicked as soon as any defender got near the pocket. He was one of those players who simply didn’t have the makeup to be an NFL quarterback.  #4 Josh Rosen Arizona Cardinals v Seattle Seahawks     Josh Rosen arrived into the NFL with a lot of hype as part of one of the most stacked QB draft classes in years. He was selected 10th overall by the Arizona Cardinals in 2018, but doubts were raised about his abilities and fit immediately. He would start just 13 games in his one and only year in Arizona, throwing 14 interceptions to 11 touchdowns. Rosen was sacked 45 times and fumbled the ball on 10 occasions to boot. It was a historically bad year for the Cardinals QB, and ironically one which helped the franchise out immensely. They were able to pick first overall in 2019 and got Kyler Murray, the replacement for Rosen. The latter was traded immediately to Miami, where he would start just three games, losing all of them whilst throwing just one touchdown and five interceptions. Rosen didn’t play at all in 2020 with the San Francisco 49ers, whilst in 2021, he threw just 11 passes all season, two of which were interceptions.     It’s hard to fathom the 10th overall pick being bounced between four teams in as many years. As a free agent in 2022, his NFL career is essentially over, and it is one of the most forgettable in living memory.  #3 DeShone Kizer Green Bay Packers v Baltimore Ravens Cleveland features heavily on this list, unsurprisingly, and DeShone Kizer was another name they drafted and spat out after years of disappointing performances. Hue Jackson wanted Colin Kaepernick signed, but received Kizer and oversaw the latter play his part in the 0-16 season.     Kizer started a full 15 games in the 2017 NFL season, but his performances were appalling. He completed just 53.6% of his passes, threw double the number of interceptions to touchdowns with 22 and 11 respectively, and fumbled the ball nine times. The fact that he led an NFL team to only the second ever 0-16 season is telling, and he never got to be a starter again. Kizer was traded to Green Bay after his rookie year, where he would throw 42 passes, no touchdowns and two interceptions. He has not played an NFL snap since and is unlikely to ever do so again.  #2 Johnny Manziel Cleveland Browns v Buffalo Bills     The only thing stopping Manziel from reaching the top spot on this list is that he had some natural talent as a quarterback. It’s almost entirely his own fault that he had such an abysmal career in the NFL. Selected by the Browns, every quarterback’s favourite franchise, Johnny Football entered the NFL as a celebrity before he had achieved anything at the pro-level. A rookie QB being fined for a hand-gesture made towards opposing fans in a pre-season loss is almost unheard of. Yet Manziel made it a reality. He would be judged accurately by the Browns’ coaching staff, who started Manziel in just two NFL games in 2014. He threw two interceptions and no touchdowns. Many expected 2015 to be the comeback year for Johnny Football. He was settled in Cleveland, but that proved to be his undoing as he appeared to party constantly. That year, he started six games and threw seven touchdowns to five interceptions, but his play was nothing more than below average by quite some distance.     A domestic violence incident was the last straw for the Browns. They were so desperate to get rid of Manziel, theyeven released a statement suggesting his future would be addressed ""as soon as permitted by league rules."" He never played in the NFL again.  #1 Paxton Lynch Atlanta Falcons v Denver Broncos Paxton Lynch was never a first-round calibre quarterback. He was then thrown into an awful situation created by the Denver Broncos and their mismanagement of Peyton Manning’s retirement. Once in the NFL, Lynch was just awful.     He would never do enough to convince the Broncos that he was starting QB material. Lynch played for the defending Super Bowl champions and threw just two touchdowns in his rookie season. His second season was no better, as he struggled to even get time on the field. The Broncos knew he was a bust and the rest of the watching world did too. Josh Kellem@JoshuaKellem#Broncos traded up for Paxton Lynch during 2016 #NFLDraft he\'s now getting outplayed by Case Cookus(?) in the #USFL if patient, team could\'ve drafted Dak Prescott on Day 2. crazy Lbroncoswire.usatoday.com/2022/06/07/usf…1#Broncos traded up for Paxton Lynch during 2016 #NFLDraft he\'s now getting outplayed by Case Cookus(?) in the #USFL if patient, team could\'ve drafted Dak Prescott on Day 2. crazy Lbroncoswire.usatoday.com/2022/06/07/usf… He threw 128 passes in the NFL with four being touchdowns and four being interceptions. For a first-round selection, that is a dreadful return on investment.     Lynch then had spells on the practice squads of Seattle and Pittsburgh, never doing enough to earn a deal. His NFL career was as short as it was dismal as a result.He was most recently picked in the 12th round of the United States Football League draft after playing as a third-string QB in the Canadian Football League.     ', ""NFL Training Camp: 5 Titans players on the roster bubble heading into training camp  The Tennessee Titans are once again focused on making the Super Bowl this season. They enter this season as the reigning AFC South champions and look set to challenge for the AFC championship.  Tennessee were active this off-season, trading for star wide receiver Julio Jones to add to their stacked offense led by QB Ryan Tannehill, RB Derrick Henry and WR AJ Brown.        Roster spots will be hotly contested during the Titans' training camp, with several starting roles up for grabs.                    View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Tennessee Titans (@titans) Tennessee Titans players who need big training-camp performances #1 Logan Woodside There will be a fierce battle for the backup quarterback role during this season's Titans' training camp. Logan Woodside was the backup last year, but he faces competition from DeShone Kizer. The 26-year-old Woodside will get his opportunity to show the Titans coaching staff that he deserves to be Ryan Tannehill's backup for the 2021 NFL season.      #2 Cameron Batson Third-year wide receiver Cameron Batson could be the odd man out in the Titans' receiving depth chart after the moves the team made this off-season. Tennessee traded for former Falcons star Julio Jones, signed veteran Josh Reynolds and drafted Dez Fitzpatrick in the fourth round. Batson does have the versatility to feature in special teams as a punt and kick-off return man, which may help keep him in the roster.  #3 Jeremy McNichols Well-traveled running back Jeremy McNichols took advantage of his opportunity with Tennessee last season. He registered career highs in games played, rush attempts and rushing yards. McNichols faces tough competition from veteran running back Brian Hill and second-year pro, Darrynton Evans, this pre-season, though.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Tennessee Titans (@titans)      #4 Derick Roberson The 25-year-old linebacker, Derick Roberson, will be fighting for his roster spot this training camp. The undrafted free agent has been with the Titans since 2019. Roberson has appeared in 11 games over the last two seasons. He has some stiff competition for the outside linebacker backup role with rookie fourth-rounder Rashad Weaver and free-agent signing, Ola Adeniyi.  #5 Chris Jackson The Titans reshuffled the deck at cornerback this off-season after cutting veterans Malcolm Butler and Adoree’ Jackson. They signed veteran Janoris Jenkins and added Caleb Farley and Elijah Molden in this year's NFL Draft.Second-year CB Chris Jackson is under pressure to stay on the active roster. The 23-year-old will need a strong performance during training camp to secure his spot among the Titans' cornerbacks this season.     "", ""NFL 2018 Squad Preview: Green Bay Packers  The Green Bay Packers are used to being serious contenders in the NFC, but the 2017 season did not go as planned. The Packers franchise Quarterback Aaron Rodgers went down with a broken collarbone in week 6, causing him to miss the majority of the rest of the season.  With Rodgers missing, the Packers failed in their quest to make the playoffs. Furthermore, with their star QB out of action, the weaknesses in the Green Bay squad were clear to see. Without Rodgers putting consistent points on the board, more pressure was put on a depleted defense, with backup QB Brett Hundley unable to keep up with the opponents' scoring. There were a lot of holes in this team that needed to be addressed this offseason.        The Packers have strengthened some of their weaknesses through the Draft and a somewhat busier Free Agency, under the direction of new General Manager Brian Gutekunst.           Green Bay Packers Here, I break down the Packers roster to determine their strengths and weaknesses by position. Quarterback - STRENGTH The Quarterback position is obviously a strong one for the Packers. Aaron Rodgers is one of the best QBs that the league has ever seen. He is fully recovered from his collarbone injury that derailed his 2017 season. He is expected to once again be in the MVP talk come the end of this coming season.     Behind him, Brett Hundley showed he can play in the NFL, but nowhere near the standard the Green Bay faithful have become accustomed to over the last 25 years. Hundley’s play last year obviously made the Green Bay hierarchy think twice about the backup situation. So much so, the Packers traded their best CB from last year, Damarious Randall, to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for their starting QB Deshone Kizer. Kizer was thrown into the deep end in his rookie season. He struggled in a poor team, failing to get a win during the whole season. Kizer did flash potential though, and the Packers obviously think he can progress his game sitting behind Rodgers for a few years. It will be interesting to see who comes out on top if Rodgers suffers another injury. Offensive Line - STRENGTH NFL: DEC 31 Packers at Lions     The Packers had an injury-hit 2017 season at Offensive Line. The only player to play all 16 games was Center, Corey Linsley. Linsley had a decent season as the linchpin of the Packers OL, giving up just one sack on the year. The Packers showed they have good strength in depth as they used a number of different combinations of players, including David Bakhtiari, Jahri Evans, Lane Taylor, Justin McCray, Jason Spriggs, Kyle Murphy and Bryan Bulaga. This year, the Packers will hope that their line can stay healthy and string together games without having to change up players positions. Pro Football Focus had Green Bay’s OL ranked at number 13 in the league which is impressive considering how many changes had to be made. Going into 2018 training camps, The Packers depth chart currently reads: LT – David Bakhtiari LG – Lane Taylor C – Corey Linsley RG – Justin McCray RT – Bryan Bulaga. Bakhtiari is arguably one of the best Left Tackles in the game when he’s healthy, excelling in pass protection and improving his run blocking. He is vital for the Packers as the leader of the OL. Linsley earned himself a new contract in the offseason, after his displays in 2017.     Bryan Bulaga will be welcomed back after injury. Bulaga has regularly played at a Pro Bowl level when on the field, but injuries have really hampered his career, playing 16 games in just 2 of his 7 seasons in the league. When healthy, Bulaga and Bakhtiari form an imposing pair of tackles for opposition defenders to try and get around. Justin McCray has earned himself a shot at the Right Guard position following the 2017 season, where he was asked to fill in all across the Offensive Line. His play convinced the Packers to not re-sign veteran Jahri Evans. I expect the Packers Offensive Line to be amongst the Top 10 OLs this season if they can keep their core players healthy. Running Back - STRENGTH Jamaal Williams celebrating his touchdown run     This year, the Packers possess one of the strongest Running Back Corps in the NFL. At the same time last offseason, there were concerns about the Packers backfield as it comprised of 2 rookies and a converted Wide Receiver. A year on and there is a lot more optimism due to their impressive displays in 2017. Ty Montgomery started as the lead back last year until an injury derailed his season. He was a true workhorse in the opening couple of games, being on the field for over 90% of snaps. Even though he impressed when called upon, the former Wide Receiver is entering this training camp as the RB3 in the Packers Offense. This is due to the impressive form shown by both Jamaal Williams and Aaron Jones. Williams was second on the depth chart to start the year and took over from Montgomery when he got injured. The injury bug once again struck as Williams was the next to go down. Aaron Jones showed that he can lead the backfield with an impressive run of performances. All in all, the Packers have 3 very capable Running Backs on their roster.     There has been talk and speculation all offseason about who will be atop the depth chart come September 9th. Much to the frustration of fantasy owners everywhere, the latest from the Green Bay camp is that it’ll be a ‘committee approach’ at running back this year. Unless someone goes down with injury in the early weeks, expect a 3 headed monster at RB for the Packers this season. Wide Receiver – WEAKNESS Adams and Allison The Wide Receiver position is usually one of strength for the Green Bay Packers. However, this season it is different, as the departure of Jordy Nelson has left a huge hole at outside receiver. Nelson was Rodgers favourite target, and his telepathic relationship with his QB will no doubt be missed.     The WR1 spot will be strong as Davante Adams has the chance to be a true elite WR in this league. Adams has the most TDs in the league over the past two seasons, and has also shown he can get it done with either Rodgers or Brett Hundley throwing to him. Adams will continue to be Rodgers favorite Red Zone target. Behind Adams, Randall Cobb has to step up. Cobb, who will play the majority of snaps out of the slot, will see an increase in targets with Nelson gone. He will hope to rekindle his 2014 form where he scored 12 TDs and caught 91 passes for over 1200 yards. Opposite Adams on the outside, Geronimo Allison is the de facto WR2. Allison has shown he can produce decent performances when called upon in the past. It will be interesting to see if he can make that jump in productivity and keep a starting slot.     Behind him, The Packers drafted 3 Receivers in the 2018 draft. J’Mon Moore, Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Equanimeous St Brown will battle it out at training camp to determine their position on the depth chart. Moore is being projected to nudge Allison out of his WR2 spot come the end of the season. Tight End – STRENGTH NFL: MAY 31 Packers OTA The Tight End position has been somewhat problematic for the Packers over the past few seasons. Many have tried and failed to produce on a consistent basis. Last year's Free Agency acquisition Martellus Bennett didn’t work out, Richard Rodgers was released after a few poor years and Jared Cook was free to go to Oakland after the 2016 season.     However, the Packers dipped their feet into the Free Agency market again, signing Jimmy Graham to a 3 year $30 million contract. Graham will be a vital component of this offense, providing a big weapon for Rodgers in the Red Zone. Graham has lost a step in recent years, but he still had double-digit TDs last season. The Packers also signed Marcedes Lewis, who wasn’t re-signed in Jacksonville. While the signing of Lewis won’t excite many fans around the league, he could be a lot more valuable than most people realise. Last season Lewis was ranked as the best run blocking Tight End in the league per Pro Football Focus. He also chipped in with 6 TDs for the Jaguars. He won’t be used too much in the passing game this season, but he could be vital for the offense and their Running Back committee. Lance Kendricks is the TE3 on the depth chart this season. He will also be used primarily as a blocker.     Defensive Line – STRENGTH Seattle Seahawks v Green Bay Packers - Mike Daniels celebrating The Packers' D-Line has become a strength of this defense in the past couple of seasons. The line is led by 2017 Pro-Bowl player, Mike Daniels, who will look to continue his brilliant form from the past season. Nose tackle Kenny Clark took a big step up last year and will look to cement his place as one of the best young NT in the league. Dean Lowry also impressed at times last year in his first full season as a starter. These 3 players will be joined by new recruit Muhammed Wilkerson and second-year player Montravius Adams. Wilkerson was signed in Free Agency to a 1-year deal. The Packers will hope he can recapture his form from a couple of seasons ago where he played under new Packers DC Mike Pettine in New York.     Linebacker – WEAKNESS Wild Card Round - Green Bay Packers v Washington Redskins The Linebacking corps should be a strength for the Packers on paper. But each year the Packers' main pass rushers seem to be hampered by injury. The two players I’m talking about are Nick Perry and Clay Matthews. Matthews was one of the best OLB’s in the league once upon a time. In recent years he’s struggled with injuries which have really affected his ability to get to the opposing QB.     Perry had similar struggles last season after having a very strong 2016. At ILB, Blake Martinez impressed in 2017, recording the most tackles in the league with 144. He also played 979 of 1052 defensive snaps for the Packers, which ranked second on the team. He was joined at ILB by second-year player Jake Ryan, who will look to improve on his snap percentage of 48.2%. Vince Biegel will look to work his way in to the defensive plans in 2018. Biegel will have a full offseason behind him, after his 2017 was hampered by injury right from the get-go. Cornerback - WEAKNESS 2018 NFL Draft     The Cornerback position has been a huge weakness for the Packers in the past few seasons. They ranked among the worst in the league in 2017, which caused the Packers to focus heavily on the position in the draft. They traded their top CB from last year, Damarious Randall to the Browns, and therefore used their first two picks on Jaire Alexander and Josh Jackson. Both players will likely play a big part for the Packers this season. The current starters at CB are second-year player Kevin King and the returning veteran Tramon Williams. Williams surprisingly ranked as the 9th best CB in the league last year at the age of 34. He will be the perfect player for the rookies to learn from. Whilst this corps is much improved from last season, it still has to be regarded as a weakness until we see the rookies produce at NFL level. Safety – WEAKNESS     Indianapolis Colts v Green Bay Packers The Safety position contributed to the Packers' defensive struggles last season. Usually led by the dependable Haha Clinton Dix, the unit struggled in coverage all season. Clinton-Dix was well below his usual level of play, with pundits voicing concerns over his commitment to the team. He was joined at safety by Morgan Burnett and Josh Jones. Burnett has been a fixture in the Packers secondary for years, but he was allowed to hit the Free Agent market this offseason and was duly snapped up by the Steelers. Josh Jones will fill his starting role in the side, whilst looking to improve on his 2017, where he admitted to not playing to the best of his ability. The whole secondary struggled last season as the Packers' pass rush wasn’t very effective, giving opposing QBs the time for their WRs to get open. With an improved pass rush this year, I expect to see the secondary step up their level of play.

At the time, he was considered the future quarterback of the franchise, but it seems that time has come and gone.  In 2019, Gardner Minshew became the starting quarterback after Nick Foles was injured in Week 1 of the season. Minshew went on to appear in 14 games, starting 12, throwing for 3,271 yards and 21 touchdowns.        Before the 2020 season, Foles was traded, making Gardner Minshew the starting quarterback for the Jaguars. After Minshew sustained injuries, Mike Glennon and Jake Luton received opportunities to start. When Gardner Minshew returned, the Jaguars weren\'t happy with his performance and replaced him in Week 15 with Mike Glennon.           The Jaguars have now drafted their new starting quarterback,Trevor Lawrence. The team signed former San Francisco 49ers backup C.J. Beathard as the backup, while Jake Luton would be third in the depth chart. That puts Gardner Minshew the odd man out, and the Jacksonville Jaguars are interested in trading him. On that note, let\'s have a look at five NFL teams that could be a good fit for Minshew. Frangie Show: Gardner Minshew was not at #Jaguars voluntary OTAs today. Urban Meyer said he expects him back Monday.""Urban has praised him publicly, but feels like in all likelihood, he\'s not going to be here this year."" - @HaysCarlyon pic.twitter.com/uVcC0i4bHt— 1010 XL / 92.5 FM (@1010XL) June 3, 2021      #1 Tennesse Titans The Tennessee Titans recently traded for wide receiver Julio Jones and have a solid offense that includes quarterback Ryan Tannehill. While Tannehill is the obvious starter in Tennessee, the depth behind him doesn\'t have a lot of experience. DeShone Kizer and Logan Woodside are the current backups to Tannehill. If either were to start in place of Tannehill, their offense might not be able to utilize all of their offensive weapons. So trading for Gardner Minshew would allow the Titans to have a solid, reliable backup quarterback, one who has a big arm and could use his legs if the need be.  #2 Carolina Panthers This off-season, the Carolina Panthers traded Teddy Bridgewater with the Denver Broncos and acquired Sam Darnold from the New York Jets. The Panthers believe offensive coordinator Joe Brady would fix any issues Darnold has had so far in his career. Darnold\'s current backup is PJ Walker, who was not only a solid Temple quarterback but also an XFL one with the Houston Roughnecks. Acquiring Gardner Minshew could be good for the Panthers because if Darnold\'s issues don\'t get resolved, the former could end up becoming their starting quarterback.     REPORT: The Jaguars might accept a 5th or 6th round pick for QB Gardner Minshew. pic.twitter.com/wPeLzhdlLA— JPA Football 🏈 (@jpafootball) June 11, 2021   #3 Indianapolis Colts The Colts traded for Carson Wentz. While they probably won\'t be trading for a backup quarterback, too, especially in their own division, it might be a good idea. Wentz has struggled to stay on the field his entire career because of injuries. The Colts\' current backup quarterback options are Jacob Eason and 2021 draft pick Sam Ehlinger. Both are young and without experience, so if Wentz were to have injury issues again, the Colts would be in a tough bind.      #4 Houston Texans Deshaun Watson\'s situation hasn\'t had any updates lately, so it is not known if or when the quarterback would start the 2021 season. The Texans drafted Davis Mills out of Stanford in this year\'s draft. The Texans also signed Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel as backup options. But with the type of offense the Texans run, Gardner Minshew might be better suited than the above options if Watson is no longer one.#5 Washington Football TeamThe Washington Football Team has added a few key pieces to their offense this off-season. Veteran journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick signed with Washington after spending two seasons with the Miami Dolphins. Fitzpatrick won\'t be the starting quarterback in the long term, so Washington will need another option soon. Gardner Minshew could be that one.     ', ""Best Quarterback Rooms in NFL - 2018 Edition  The quarterback position is arguably the most important position in the NFL, while the backup quarterback position is the second most important position. The spot has not been in a better situation than 2018 in a long time. The quarterback climate has a perfect mix of veterans and new blood.  The ranking for the quarterback room has taken into account the starter, backup quarterback, scout team QB, supporting cast, offensive system and teams' expected run-to-pass ratio along with past performance and history of injury.        The article ranks the teams by scoring each quarterback and taking the cumulative score as a marker. The third quarterback is only taken into account if they are a viable trade bait or hold any chance to start during the regular season.           #32 Jacksonville Jaguars Starter - Blake Bortles, Backup - Cody Kessler Blake Bortles will try to not let his defense down It is one of the very few quarterback-proof rosters in the NFL. The team will look to lean on the run game in the offense this season. Blake Bortles has to improve his mechanics to move out the bottom of the list and Kessler will need to shake off his winless season with the Browns.     #31 Carolina Panthers Starter - Cam Newton, Backup - Taylor Heinicke Newton will have to become the Superman from 2015 Cam has to be the Superman again under new ownership. Panthers have Taylor Heinicke as their backup. If you are thinking who that person is, you are not alone. #30 Kansas City Chiefs Starter - Pat Mahomes, Backup - Chad Henne Mahomes will have to be the present and future of the squad     Pat Mahomes has not started a relevant game in the NFL. He has potential but Texas Tech's air raid offense is not the best to go by. Chad Henne couldn't beat out Blake Bortles at his worst, which is not the best news for Chiefs faithful. #29 Miami Dolphins Starter - Ryan Tannehill, Backup - Brock Osweiler Tannehill will be playing for his job Brock Osweiler can't be described as the best backup policy for Tannehill, who is coming back from a knee injury last season. The coaching staff is in the hot seat and sharing the division with Patriots does not help.     #28 Washington Redskins Starter - Alex Smith, Backup - Colt McCoy Alex Smith will have to bring his MVP season from Kansas City Alex Smith might live up to his MVPesque season from last time but McCoy would live on as a below average backup QB forever. Alex Smith ain't the worst option after Kirk Cousins left. #27 Houston Texans Starter - Deshaun Watson. Backup - Brandon Weeden Deshaun Watson will have to be the player he was before the injury     Houston has Weeden as their backup to their sophomore superstar coming off an ACL injury, O'Brien would hope for a better option than that. The team hopes to stay fit next season and do some damage in AFC. #26 Dallas Cowboys Starter - Dak Prescott, Backup - Mike White, Cooper Rush Prescott will get his sidekick in Ezekial Elliott back for the season Dak and Zeke form a formidable offense but the Cowboys quarterback room could do better than Mike White and Rush. Jason Garrett must be hoping for Kellen Moore (probably not).     #25 Cincinnati Bengals Starter - Andy Dalton, Backup - Matt Barkley Dalton will have to bemoreconsistent upcoming season Cincinnati Bengals have changes looming in front of them, the coaching staff is in the hot seat and the QB room ain't helping. Andy Dalton has been used to define the term 'average' all over the NFL dictionary and Barkley never lived up to his high school potential. #24 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Starter - Winston, Backup - Ryan Fitzpatrick Tampa Bay will not have Winston for the first 3 weeks per suspension     Winston will serve his ban and Ryan Fitzpatrick will be QB-1 in the depth chart, sounds depressing, probably is. #23 Baltimore Ravens Starter/ Backup - Joe Flacco, Lamar Jackson. The QB competition is in full swing at Ravens camp Ravens' coaching has been immensely impressed with rookie Lamar Jackson. The reports from preseason indicate that Joe Flacco has been showing more initiation as well. Ravens will be looking to capitalize on a soft AFC. #22 Chicago Bears Starter - Mitchell Trubisky, Backup - Chase Daniels Trubisky can lead Bears to playoffs and become the greatest franchise QB     Bears have a new offensive system and Chase Daniel as the backup, who has come from the Chiefs system that Matt Nagy will be running. Trubisky needs to live up to his draft pedigree and Bears can easily jump to the next tier. #21 Buffalo Bills Starter - AJ McCarron, Backup - Josh Allen, Nathan Peterman The team will hope for Josh Allen to win the starting job Bills brought in McCarron from Bengals as an insurance policy to their Rookie, Josh Allen. Bills have an average starter, one raw rookie, and a backup with starting capabilities in Peterman. No one should be surprised if everyone gets a start in Buffalo.     #20 Denver Broncos Starter - Case Keenum, Backup - Paxton Lynch, Chad Kelly Keenum will hop to fill the big shoes of Peyton Manning Case Keenum had a career year last season but he won't have the similar support cast as Minnesota. Paxton Lynch has bust written all over him and won't even command a conditional pick in return. #19 Tennessee Titans Starter - Marcus Mariota, Backup - Blaine Gabbert Mariota needs to bounce back from a dreadful last season     Titans have been a run first team but Mariota needs to improve his play for them to compete against Houston in the division. Gabbert can be a great backup in the correct system with his cannon arm and great mobility. #18 New York Giants Starter - Eli Manning, Backup - Davis Webb/ Kyle Lauletta Eli Manning will have to deliver with the run game to support Eli Manning has lost way too many steps to be a top tier QB but his stellar offensive sidekicks should take him to the belief land. Davis Webb has been making a lot of noise this offseason along with Kyle Lauletta at the backup position.     #17 Oakland Raiders Starter - Derek Carr, Backup - Connor Cooks Derek Carr will have to gel into Gruden's offense sooner than later Derek Carr underachieved last season. Cook and Carr will soon realize that life under Gruden is not as rosy as Gruden Camp. The team has Jeff Fisher vibes of finishing 8-8. #16 Detroit Lions Starter - Matthew Stafford, Backup - Matt Cassel Stafford can rise up to the next level     Stafford has one of the best arm seen in the sport but he needs a better support cast. How does Matt Cassel still have a job in NFL, even though it is as a backup? #15 Atlanta Falcons Starter - Matt Ryan, Backup - Matt Schaub Matt Ryan can bring the Falcons to the top Matt Ryan has had a legendary career till now, without winning the big one. The bad news is that they have Matt Schaub as the backup. #14 New Orleans Saints Starter - Drew Brees, Backup - Tom Savage     Drew Brees will look to take Saints further than last time Saints are moving on to a more run-heavy offense which might help the longevity of Brees. Saints are one of the big boys of NFC and Brees would love to make one last run before father time gets him. Tom Savage is not what you dream of as a backup but Saints don't have an option. Hill is the scout team QB who is turning heads at camp. #13 Seattle Seahawks Starter - Russell Wilson, Backup - Austin Davis     Russell Wilson will look for some help from the run offense Russell Wilson is a one-man offense for Seahawks with zero run game, no O-line help and below par receiving core. Russell Wilson does it all but sadly Austin Davis can't. The diminishing quality of Seahawks defense makes their chances of playoff dim. #12 Los Angeles Rams LA Rams - Starter - Jared Goff, Backup - Sean Mannion Goff will look to improve on his stellar performance last season     Jared Goff took a big leap last season. Sean McVay has been a godsend to Rams offense. Sean Mannion is not the best backup option but he has been in the system and a good subordinate to the young future of Los Angeles. Goff is a sneaky MVP candidate with Gurley by the sides. #11 Pittsburgh Steelers Starter - Roethlisberger, Backup - Mason Rudolph/ Landry Jones Roethlisberger will look to capitalize on Bell's last year in Pittsburgh Steelers have a complete offense led by Big Ben. His two quarterback understudies are raw and with minimal arm talent. Roethlisberger has been injured in bits and pieces over the last few seasons and the weak backup situation doesn't help the Steelers.     #10 Los Angeles Chargers Starter - Rivers, Backup - Geno Smith/ Cardale Jones Rivers will be looking for some luck and support from the fans Rivers is a great starter with a competent backup in Geno Smith. The run game led by Melvin Gordon with the receiving talent of Keenan Allen would be a handful for any defense. If the team stays fit, they can be a challenger for the AFC title. #09 San Francisco 49ers Starter - Jimmy Garoppolo, Backup - CJ Bethard Jimmy G will look to become Jimmy GQ     Garoppolo ended the 49ers season last year with 5 wins. The only way for the 49ers is up. Kyle Shanahan has one of the most sophisticated offenses in the league. CJ Bethard as the backup is a little suspect. Bay area is waiting for Jimmy G to become Jimmy Jesus. #8 Cleveland Browns Starter - Tyrod Taylor, Backup - Baker Mayfield/ Drew Stanton Baker and Tyrod will look to bring back the glory at Cleveland Browns were the worst team in Football but they have added to every position on the pitch. Taylor is a dependable QB, who can give you 5 wins on his worst day. Baker is the future with great football ethics and Drew Stanton will be a great third QB while developing a rookie. Browns look like a sneaky break out team for the upcoming season.     #07 Green Bay Packers Starter - Aaron Rodgers, Backup - DeShone Kizer Rodgers will be without his favorite wide receiver next season Rodgers has been known to hide most of the blemishes of his team. Packers traded for Kizer to be the backup, who was the QB of a 16 loss team. The addition of Jimmy Graham at tight end position will come as a great help after Nelson left. #06 New England Patriots Starter - Tom Brady, Backup - Brian Hoyer/ Danny Etling Brady will look to defy father time for one more season     Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time. Brian Hoyer is definitely not the greatest backup quarterback of all time. Brady's age is a sign of trouble but he is the reigning MVP of the league. Patriots have drafted Danny Etling in the late rounds who could turn up to be a great option for the future. #05 Indianapolis Colts Starter - Andrew Luck, Backup - Jacoby Brissett Luck finally looks set to be back alongside promising backup in Brissett If Andrew Luck wasn't coming back from injury, Colts could have been the top team in this exercise. Brissett has been a great trade by Colts. Luck has started training again and the revamped offensive line won't hurt either. The future looks bright for the franchise.     #04 New York Jets Starter/ Backup - Darnold, Josh McCown, Bridgewater Jets will have one of the most balanced quarterback room No one expected Jets to end up this high on the list but they have a great experienced starter and teacher in Josh McCown. They arguably got the best quarterback from the recent draft in Sam Darnold and they signed Teddy Bridgewater for free in the offseason. Bridgewater is the biggest trade asset in the league and front-runner for the comeback player of the year. Jets have stability at the position for the first time in a long time.     #03 Minnesota Vikings Starter - Kirk Cousins, Backup - Trevor Siemian Cousins will be expected to live up to his price tag The future looks bright for the franchise. Kirk Cousins is underrated even after being the costliest player in football and Siemian is as good a backup as any. Vikings will try to make the run in a loaded NFC. #02 Arizona Cardinals Starter - Sam Bradford, Backup - Josh Rosen/ Mike Glennon Rosen will look to earn the starts while Bradford needs to stay fit     The Cardinals have one of the most polished QB coming out of College in Rosen. Sam Bradford can be a top 15 quarterback when fit. The quarterback room compliments each other, unlike any other team. Cardinals can shock a lot of people next season. #01 Philadelphia Eagles Starter - Carson Wentz, Backup - Nick Foles Eagles would love another Philly special, with Wentz this time Nick Foles just won Philly the Superbowl, while the future MVP of the league (Wentz) was sidelined with an injury. Eagles have things sorted till Foles gets traded for too many draft picks. The Eagles QB room might just help them reach the mountaintop again. The in-depth look into every quarterback room made me realize that Matt Cassel, Matt Schaub, and Landry Jones will keep having backup jobs in 2096 and no one will ever notice. In conclusion. my biggest fear is that Blake Bortles will end up winning the Superbowl and make this article as irrelevant as his throwing motion.

I was walking around this morning and one thought kept bouncing around my head: Why does Jared Goff suck now?  The Los Angeles Rams are going into a wild card playoff game and the media are suggesting head coach Sean McVay should start an undrafted free agent in John Wolford, who in his past was once cut by Adam Gase.        How did a 2-time Pro Bowler and former Super Bowl starting QB end up in such a confusing situation? To find this out I\'ve been examining Goff\'s complete development cycle looking for reasons for peaks and valleys and trying to identify which of the valley\'s are reoccurring right now.            Jared Goff, The Los Angeles Rams #1 Overall Pick Los Angeles Rams Introduce Jared Goff In 2016 Jared Goff a California kid who had a consensus first round grade playing at a well known and respected Californian NCAA college team in Berkley where he showcased great signs of being potential Franchise Quarterback. Jared Goff was PFF\'s highest graded college quarterback in 2015. One quote in the draft report sighted his pocket presence as being a major strength, ""Moves in the pocket to find passing lanes, keeps his eyes up while maneuvering the pocket"". In many way Goff was a dream draft pick for the Rams who were making a return to southern California.     It didn\'t matter that fellow draft prospect Carson Wentz had the more impressive raw tools. Goff was a business move as much as a draft pick. The Rams were trying to break into a market that contains 2 Premier NBA teams, one prestigious baseball team and many other sports franchises fighting for attention in the city. The Rams traded with the Tennessee Titans for the first overall pick in the 2016 NFL draft, along with a fourth and sixth-round pick in the same draft. To acquire the picks, the Rams traded away their first-round pick, two second-round picks, and a third-round pick in 2016, and their first and third-round picks in the 2017 NFL draft. That was quite the haul and quite the investment on a rookie QB. The planning going into Jared Goff\'s rookie year was very detailed and impressive everything after was stunningly disappointing.  2016 The Lost Year Of Development For Jared Goff     Seattle Seahawks v Los Angeles Rams Jared Goff had a pretty rough rookie year. Derek Carr had the original ""was the presumptive MVP before injuries derailed his campaign"" a full year before Carson Wentz patented the term. Dak Prescott\'s rookie year remains his best year. #NFL pic.twitter.com/omvYpwtIDx— Mab Sidam Analysis (@MabSidam) January 7, 2021 Jared Goff\'s rookie year was a nightmare due to mismanagement and a poor team around him. The offensive line allowed too many pressures and he was careless with the football trying to make plays for what was a struggling team. Jared Goff achieved the following his rookie year;     An 0 and 7 starting record. 5 touchdowns against 7 interceptions across 7 games. An 18.3 QBR(Graded out of 100). In many ways Jared Goff was the worst quarterback of 2016. For the LA Rams who had made a significant investment in Goff through draft assets and the marketing budget this was the worst case scenario, the were trying to break into a new market and their lead marketing face was either on the bench or sucking it up on the field. Also Read: Who is Sean McVay\'s girlfriend, Veronika Khomyn?   Jared Goff was one of the worst performing quarterbacks of 2016. Goff was 2016\'s number 1 overall pick while Petty was a 4th round pick from the year before. Matt Ryan, Tom Brady and Dak Prescott were all having career years. #NFL pic.twitter.com/snAPgMbxLI— Mab Sidam Analysis (@MabSidam) January 7, 2021     Jeff Fisher deserves a lion share of the blame for Goff\'s poor play. The veteran coached recognized early that Goff while talented was clearly not ready to start games at the NFL level. He had Goff do a crash course on his scheme as he failed to handle the media storm that generated as to why the #1 overall pick could not beat out Case Keenum as starting Rams QB. Many labeled the young QB as one of the biggest NFL draft busts of all time as he struggled through 7 straight loses(his 49ers and Falcon games were especially terrible) never showing any of the poise and talent that made him a stand out draft prospect. The worst thing to come of this nightmare scenario was that everyone knew coach Fisher and his staff would be let go at the end of the year yet Jared Goff still spent a lot of precious development time studying, practicing and playing in a scheme he would never play in again. The LA Rams a year into the investment had to make drastic moves to save what was quickly becoming an embarrassing decision by the franchise.      2017; Emergency QB Surgery Houston Texans v Los Angeles Rams The LA Rams assembled an offensive staff full of brilliant and innovative minds of varying experience to oversee the growth of their young franchise QB. Sean McVay was only 30 when he was hired to be the new Rams head coach but had past working experience under offensive gurus Mike Shanahan and Jon Gruden. McVay was a young and innovative offensive mind whose first job was to fix what many considered damaged good at the time. To further help McVay with Jared Goff was new Rams Offensive Co- Ordinator (current Green Bay Packers coach) Matt LaFleur, Quarterbacks coach(current Las Vegas OC) Greg Olsen, Running Back coach Skip Peete had 18 years of NFL coaching the position at the time of his hiring, current receivers coach Eric Yarber had been a WR position coach for 17 years at the time of his hiring, the assistant wide receivers coach Zac Taylor would go on to be the head coach for the Cincinnati Bengals, Offensive line coach Aaron Kromer had 18 years of experience coaching the position.     This dream team offensive staff that contained 2 future NFL coaches and one offensive co-ordinator married with a 2017 offseason where the team reloaded in the draft through picks such as Cooper Kupp in the third, free agency moves such as bringing in Franchise left tackle Andrew Whitworth, Center John Sullivan and wide receiver Robert Woods. All these moves fit under the Rams cap space as Jared Goff was still on his rookie QB deal. The rams went from a bottom tier NFL franchise with a bust starting to an 11 and 5 team with a really bright future all over 24 months. I really though DeShone Kizer would be someone special for the Browns, I was dead wrong. Rookie Deshaun Watson leading ""near"" MVP Wentz is very surprising. Case Keenum is still getting paid based on this one sole season. Alex Smith was a good QB sadly Andy Reid wanted more. #NFL pic.twitter.com/S3LoGFM6LU— Mab Sidam Analysis (@MabSidam) January 7, 2021     Jared Goff hiding behind Tyrod Taylor in the middle of the chart went from a certified bust to about NFL league average thanks to the massive support he received from the organization.  The Golden Year 2018 Super Bowl LIII - New England Patriots v Los Angeles Rams In 2018 the Rams capitalized on Goff\'s rookie contract by going all in that year, they aggressively assembled a talented and deep roster, went 13 and 3, had the NFL\'s 2nd highest scoring offense. McVay\'s passing and running units were both top 5 in terms of yards respectively. Jared Goff posted numbers signifying he was taking the step forward from average to good in his 3rd year;     In 2018 it was well worth doubting the futures of Ryan Tannehill, Aaron Rodgers and Josh Rosen. Sadly only 2 made it out. If Brees never faded out late in the season he wins MVP this year. Nick Foles was amazing in relief this year. Watson\'s down year is Goff\'s career year. #NFL pic.twitter.com/IeIe2vhWBT— Mab Sidam Analysis (@MabSidam) January 7, 2021 It was well established that the team ran through 2017 OPOY Todd Gurley but Goff\'s development was a major source of pride for the entire organization and despite a shaky Super Bowl performance the franchise felt comfortable extending the young QB early into the 2019 NFL season with a 4 year 134 Million extension. 2 years down the line sadly that has proven to be a mistake.  2019 and 2020; An Average QB New York Jets v Los Angeles Rams     Over the last 2 years Jared Goff has been aggressively mediocre. The Rams starting Quarterback has thrown 29 interceptions in his last 31 starts. It\'s impossible to be bad in the brilliant offense Sean McVay runs but God knows Jared Goff has tried. A scheme which features 3 receivers who routinely get open (Edelman types) struggles to move the ball, what?!? As the franchise has relied more on him over the last few years due to Goff\'s contract forcing them to trim the fat off their cap space the QB\'s play has declined. Jared Goff seemed to be a potential Franchise QB but has shown an inability to carry the franchise on his own. Franchise QB\'s are the foundation upon which teams build their identity and the rams are as inconsistent and non threatening this year as their Quarterback.  2020; Why Does Jared Goff Suck? The Dream Offensive Staff Is No More     New York Jets v Los Angeles Rams In 2017 Jared Goff had hands on development from a very gifted group of coaches, 2 have gone on to be Head Coaches while others have found jobs at other prestigious NFL franchises. As they have left no one can blame Sean McVay for failing to maintain this absurd standard of offensive brilliance. The more that\'s been put on McVay\'s plate the more he has asked from his starting Quarterback and Goff has consistently failed to bail his head coach out. Many of Mahomes signature plays come after the initial play has broken down and he has to come up with something quick to move the chains. That\'s the difference between a guy and ""the guy"".     Jared Goff sucks now cause he always has, the Rams spent a small country\'s GDP on talent around him to make sure he turned out into a franchise QB and over the last 3 years his delivered 1 borderline top 10 season and two other mediocre seasons. The brilliance of the Rams organization, Sean McVay and the various play callers to pass through turned Jared Goff (a certified bust at their point of arrival) into an above average NFL game manager and an NFL starter. That\'s as far as it seems Jared Goff is able to go thus he is holding the franchise back and is simply not worth the investment anymore. He doesn\'t even have a Carson Wentz near MVP year to justify the Rams sticking through tight rope thin for him. Jared Goff was a great idea but what\'s really out there peaks at about above average to good. If the Rams are serious about establishing themselves in the LA market a new franchise QB is a must.

77,Teddy Bridgewater,"[""NFL Trade Rumors: 3 landing spots for Teddy Bridgewater  Teddy Bridgewater could be on the move this off-season. The Carolina Panthers are freeing up cap space to help land Houston Texans starting quarterback Deshaun Watson. If the Panthers move Teddy Bridgewater then it will tell us if they are close to landing Watson.  A year ago the Carolina Panthers signed Teddy Bridgewater to a 3-year $63 million contract after his performance with the Saints. Bridgewater started 15 games for the Panthers in 2020. He led the Carolina Panthers to a (4-11) record and missed the NFL playoffs.        Teddy Bridgewater threw for 15 touchdowns but also threw 11 interceptions. At times last season, he showed that he was not ready to be a starting quarterback. Teddy is a lot like Alex Smith, he will win games during the season but will never win a Super Bowl.           If the Carolina Panthers are pushing hard for Deshaun Watson and can land the Texans quarterback, then they will need to move Bridgewater. Here are three teams that could use his help in the short-term.  NFL Trade Rumors: Three short-term landing spots for Teddy Bridgewater Carolina Panthers QB Teddy Bridgewater is a short-term fix     Teddy Bridgewater is not a long-term fix for NFL franchises. However, he can be a valuable short-term fix. There are three teams that are in need of a short-term fix at quarterback. Teddy Bridgewater just unfollowed the Panthers on Instagram and went private pic.twitter.com/4MArZCrFdZ— 𝘼𝙣𝙙𝙧𝙚🎯(8-21) (@PistonsHateMe) February 20, 2021  1) Chicago Bears Chicago Bears HC Matt Nagy     The Chicago Bears are picking 20th overall in the 2021 NFL draft. They failed to land Carson Wentz from the Philadelphia Eagles. Now the Bears will look for a short-term fix at quarterback with Teddy Bridgewater. Chicago is not 100% sold on their current quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. Trubisky is set to be a free agent in 2021 and could have a number of teams calling for his services. Bridgewater will give the Bears a good short-term fix until they find a quarterback that they feel strongly about.  2) New England Patriots New England Patriots HC Bill Belichick     The New England Patriots are looking for a starting quarterback for the 2021 NFL season. New England is not a landing spot that NFL quarterbacks are jumping at as of right now. This is why pursuing Teddy Bridgewater makes sense for the Patriots. Gotta feel for Teddy Bridgewater. He’s played average to above average everywhere he’s been and now the Panthers are clearing room to replace him with a new shiny toy in Deshaun Watson. I’m not saying the Panthers are wrong for doing it, I just feel bad for Teddy pic.twitter.com/buiORgQpaz— Dan Orlovsky’s Burner (@OrlovskyBurner) February 20, 2021 Teddy Bridgewater gives the New England Patriots their short-term fix at quarterback. The Cam Newton experiment failed for the Patriots because he turned the football over too much. Bridgewater will give the Patriots a polished passer that plays it safe and will not cost them football games.      3) Washington Football Team Washington Football Team HC Ron Rivera Washington is another team that drafts too high in the NFL draft to land one of the top three quarterbacks. They also do not have a lot of trade options to land Deshaun Watson. This is where Teddy Bridgewater enters the conversation. Ron Rivera has not counted out a reunion with former starting quarterback Cam Newton but it doesn't seem likely. Teddy Bridgewater is a good fit for Washington in the short-term. The NFC East is weak and Washington has the defense to lead them back to the playoffs. In Bridgewater, they will have a quarterback that can start and give them a shot at winning a playoff game, until they find the answer they want at quarterback. Unsure about a trade offer?

The Carolina Panthers have been the most talked-about team when it comes to landing Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson. With the recent lawsuits that have been placed against Watson, it's going to be tough to get him at the moment. Deshaun Watson has made it known that he has no problem sitting out until the Texans trade him.  Houston recently added former Los Angeles Chargers back-up quarterback Tyrod Taylor, but it's hard to believe the Texans will enter the 2021-2022 NFL season with him as their starting quarterback. Instead of the Panthers pursuing the Texans starting quarterback, Houston would be wise to pursue Teddy Bridgewater to start while Watson sits.

He struggles when the weight of a franchise is on his shoulders. When he started for the New Orleans Saints in 2019, Bridgewater went (5-0) as a starter. Back then, there was no question that Bridgewater was a temporary starter until Drew Brees returned from injury. His performance in the 2019-2020 NFL season landed him a big payday with Carolina, and Bridgewater held the weight of the Carolina Panthers franchise on his shoulders. They finished the 2020-2021 NFL season with a (4-11) record. If the Houston Texans pursue Teddy Bridgewater through a trade, they could be getting the same version of Bridgewater that played for New Orleans. The Texans have made it known that Deshaun Watson is their quarterback and that is not changing. This will take the spotlight off of Bridgewater. With the QB trade market heating up, here's where we think the top QBs end up:Deshaun Watson: #Panthers Russell Wilson: #Seahawks Carson Wentz: #Colts Sam Darnold: #WashingtonFootballDerek Carr: #Raiders Marcus Mariota: #49ers Teddy Bridgewater: #Texans Jimmy G: #Patriots— Turfside Talk (@TurfsideTalk) February 12, 2021     Teddy Bridgewater has the skill set to be a successful starting quarterback. He showed that with the Minnesota Vikings in 2015 when he finished with an (11-5) record. The Houston Texans will be getting a quarterback that will take a lot of risks. Outside of his rookie year and last season, Teddy Bridgwater doesn't turn the football over often. With all the issues surrounding Deshaun Watson, it only makes sense for the Houston Texans to find a temporary replacement. Teddy Bridgewater is the perfect temporary replacement for Watson for the 2021-2022 NFL season. Unsure about a trade offer?

Perhaps the most important thing to happen over the course of the game was the fact that it became clear who should be the starting quarterback for the Broncos. If everything was pointing to the battle being very tight, Saturday's game made it clear that the competition has a winner.        On that note, here are three key observations after the Broncos-Seahawks game:           #1 It's Teddy's team If the quarterback battle was tight, Bridgewater's performance on Saturday all but helped him lock his spot as the Broncos' starter for week 1. With so much talent along the offense, Bridgewater doesn't really need to elevate the group so much but execute it well, and that's exactly what he's doing to show Vic Fangio that he should be the starter. Teddy Bridgewater’s preseason line to date:16-of-19 (84.2 pct.)179 yards9.42 YPA2 TD passes0 INTRating: 141.0Drive results:FGTDTDTDPoints per possession: 6.0 (!)— Andrew Mason (@MaseDenver) August 22, 2021     Bridgewater completed nine passes out of 11 attempts, threw a touchdown and seemed much more comfortable than Lock, his opponent for the starting job. He's also more experienced, and has at least proven himself capable of taking a team to the playoffs. When week 1 arrives, Bridgewater will be QB1.  #2 Seahawks' revamped pass rush makes this team a threat Denver Broncos vs Seattle Seahawks Seattle did a good job fixing one of the team's main weaknesses this past offseason, as the pass rush now can actually pressure opposing quarterbacks and not rely on Jamal Adams to do so.     Two sacks isn't a huge number by any means, but the pressure was there all night long, and both Teddy Bridgewater and Drew Lock had problems dealing with the Seahawks' defense. Yes, Denver's offensive line is not an amazing group, but they still would have won this matchup fairly easily last year. But not in 2021.  #3 Seahawks got what they paid for in the secondary Shaquil Griffin is not a superstar, but he's still a solid corner to play in the league, and he was the best cornerback in the Seahawks' roster over the last couple of years.

From Russell Wilson. #Seahawks \u2066@thenewstribune\u2069 pic.twitter.com/vi11aMN5sf— Gregg Bell (@gbellseattle) August 18, 2021     Seattle chose to let him hit the market and try to fix the position with band-aids, and the result was exactly what one would expect when Ahkello Witherspoon is your CB1. He suffered in coverage against Jerry Jeudy, and after four uninspiring years with the San Francisco 49ers, there's not much to be excited about with the prospect of him being the main cornerback for the Seattle Seahawks.     "", 'Von Miller praises Teddy Bridgewater for leadership after Week 1 win  Many were wary about Teddy Bridgewater being named the starting QB for the Denver Broncos this season. He was 4-11 as a starter with the Carolina Panthers in 2020 and 5-1 over two years with the New Orleans Saints.   He may not have had the best preseason performance, but head coach Vic Fangio saw something in him that Drew Lock didn\'t. Von Miller may have seen the same thing now.

There was the era of Peyton Manning from 2012 to 2015 where Von Miller played two Super Bowls and won one. Since Manning retired, it has been a rough going for the Broncos. With Teddy Bridgewater, it seems like things were still going to be the same.     Against the New York Giants in Week 1, Teddy Bridgewater went 28/36 (77.78%) for 264 yards and two TDs. I would say that was better than most people expected him to play, and he showed great accuracy on his intermediate throws.

Von Miller and Teddy Bridgewater had an intimate moment that was caught on tape on the sideline during the game. Miller told Teddy that he hadn\'t felt that way in a long time, since back when ""18 was here"".      The reference of 18 was Peyton Manning. Miller praised Teddy Bridgewater for his pep talks, and said they go a long way. His pep talks obviously worked well enough to get the win in Week 1.  It\'s also a huge positive for Teddy, as his leadership skills shine along with his abilities on the field. Vic Fangio may have made the right call after all by going with Teddy over Drew Lock.

Teddy Bridgewater will need to avoid turnovers that cost the team the victory and stay accurate with his throws, though. Hell, those Aaron Rodgers rumors of him joining the Denver Broncos could be over by the trade deadline at this rate. That was especially after how bad Aaron Rodgers was in Week 1 and how good Teddy Bridgewater fared during the same week.     ', ""Who is the Dolphins' starting QB vs. the Bills today?  Skylar Thompson will make his third career start in the Miami Dolphins' postseason wild-card matchup versus the Buffalo Bills today.  In his media briefing on Friday, Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel announced the development and said Teddy Bridgewater had fought arduously to make himself ready as a depth option for the contest.        According to coach Tua Tagovailoa, the team's starting quarterback was ruled out of the game on Wednesday due to persistent concussion symptoms.            Since the day after Christmas, when he had his second concussion of the season, Tagovailoa has been in the concussion protocol.  The AFC East winners will pose an obstacle for Thompson. The two teams are squaring off for the third time this season. Each of the two teams has won one apiece.    Skylar Thompson will need to be on his best form to provide the Dolphins with a shot at winning against the Buffalo Bills in a knockout game.      In the final game of the regular season, he was the starter versus the New York Jets and completed 20 of his 31 passes for 152 yards. The 25-year-old recorded his maiden career victory despite not having a TD or an interception. Although Thompson's performance was not the most striking, it would be inaccurate to argue that he appeared out of rhythm. He must have had a week to get used to teammates like Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle.

We all know what\'s happening in Minnesota: a quarterback situation.  Three quarterbacks heading into free agency and what can we expect from the Minnesota Vikings front office to do about it? Here\'s a backstory:        Quarterback (QB) Teddy Bridgewater was the franchise QB the team needed and was performing well. In 2016, he severely injured his left leg and did not play until the Week 15 of 2017 season. As a result of his injury, the Vikings traded for QB Sam Bradford from the Philadelphia Eagles in 2016. He performed well until an injury to his knee in 2017 and played just one game that season. This time, QB Case Keenum was brought in.  Keenum\'s performance left my jaw dropping, and certainly many others too. He did not look like the same player under Jeff Fisher\'s system with the Los Angeles Rams. But now that all three quarterbacks are free agents, what should the Vikings do? This is my take on what the front office should do: - It\'s obvious that QB needy teams will pursue Keenum, and after his performance, I believe the Vikings should give him another one or two year ""prove it"" deal that will solidify whether or not Keenum is the answer for the foreseeable future. However, the Vikings can also place the franchise tag on Keenum, which would give him around $23 million     - \u200eBridgewater is still a young guy who is capable of starting somewhere. But on what team? If the Vikings bring back Keenum, I believe they will bring Bridgewater back as well - \u200eEven though the Vikings gave the Eagles a 1st round pick for Bradford, I don\'t think it\'s worth keeping him simply because of his issues with staying healthy. Bradford will not be pursued by the Vikings and will hit the QB market. He will likely end up on a team in need of a backupAgain, this is what I think the front office should do, currently it is unclear what will happen.

The lineups on FanDuel and DraftKings will be challenging since both teams are missing several playmakers.   These platforms run a weekly tournament where you can build your fantasy lineup. You can join a tournament for Thursday Night Football with a lineup made only of players from the Browns and the Broncos.        FanDuel's budget to build a team is $60,000. DraftKings has a smaller budget of $50,000 to create a team. Single-game tournaments are different, as you pick five players (FanDuel) or six players (DraftKings) from any offensive skill position, defense and kicker, with one being an MVP who earns 1.5x points.           Check out some tips to build the best lineup of NFL players to take to the field in Thursday Night Football on October 21st.

Rush is now 4-0 as the Cowboys\' starting quarterback, and he has kept the team afloat in the absence of Prescott, who suffered a thumb injury in Week 1 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.                     Following another great performance from Cooper Rush, Colin Cowherd is confident that the Cowboys have two QB1s as the gap between Dak Prescott and Cooper Rush is not that big. Here\'s what Cowherd said: ""Most people aren\'t saying Cooper Rush is Dak Prescott, but he\'s won four straight starts. Okay, right. Teddy Bridgewater. won five straight starts for the saints as a backup. Why? Because Teddy Bridgewater is an arguable starter. He\'s a low end starter or a great backup. Cooper Rush is a great backup. Or perhaps he\'s a low end starter.""     Colin Cowherd added: ""Well, most of us and most people I know in the league consider Dak Prescott, a middle of the pack starter. So Dak is better than Cooper rush. But it\'s not a huge gap."" Cowherd continued: ""If you put Dak on the field going up against Cooper rush, Dak better, a little better.

Dak Prescott is expected to make his much-awaited return against the Los Angeles Rams next week Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Dallas Cowboys     Barring any late setbacks, Prescott is scheduled to make his return from injury next week against the Los Angeles Rams.

During their Week 3 victory over the Buffalo Bills, he suffered a back injury that looked like it was a head injury. Four days later, in their Thursday night game vs. the Cincinnati Bengals, he got slammed to the ground and hit his head, which resulted in a concussion.        ESPN analyst Marcus Spears passionately spoke about how head coach Mike McDaniel and the team failed to handle Tua Tagovailoa\'s injury situation.           Spears said: ""Mike McDaniel, he just don\'t need to talk about it - that\'s number one. He said the wrong things, \'I would never put a guy out there.\' Guys go out in games playing hurt all the time, that\'s a lie."" Spears added that he thinks it was a mistake by the Dolphins to allow the quarterback to play on Thursday night. He added: ""If you went back and saw and reviewed the film of the Buffalo Bills game, it ain\'t no way in hell Tua should have played Thursday vs. the Bengals."" Spears wasn\'t the only analyst to criticize the Dolphins coaching staff surrounding the situation. The dangers regarding concussions have prompted pundits all around the league to lift their opinion on the situation.

This is set to be the first game of the season that Tagovailoa will miss. Bridgewater stepped in for the starter during Thursday night\'s loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. Bridgewater had a decent performance, throwing 14-23, with 193 yards, a touchdown and an interception. He\'ll have his work cut out for him in Week 5 though. The Jets are coming off an impressive 24-20 win over Mike Tomlin\'s Pittsburgh Steelers. Starting quarterback Zach Wilson is back from injury to lead Robert Saleh\'s offense.

The game against the Jets will not be remembered too fondly, but at least the Patriots won a division game and improved to 6-4 on the season. Jones was rather efficient in the win, completing 23 of his 27 passes for 246 yards. The running game was solid enough with Damien Harris (8 carries, 65 yards) as the standout on the day. Running back Rhamondre Stevenson was New England\'s best receiver (6 receptions, 56 yards) and that says something.

Wilson completed just nine of his 22 passes for 77 yards and the Jets’ running game was basically non-existent as they could only manage 59 rushing yards. Both teams were poor on third-down conversions, completing just seven of 29 combined. Another stat that popped out was that there was 17 punts in the game, with the Jets accounting for 10 of those.

NFL Pro Day performance shows similarities  New York Jets quarterback Zach Wilson put on a show on his NFL Pro Day before the 2021 NFL Draft and it raised his draft stock quite significantly. It culminated in him being drafted with the second overall pick, but the former BYU quarterback has yet to live up to the hype.  Another player who looked extremely good on his Pro Day many years ago was former Denver Broncos first-round pick Paxton Lynch. He was the 26th overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft and while he looked great on his pro day, his football career has been a total disaster.                     Both Wilson and Lynch surprised many with incredible throws and athleticism in their Pro Days, which attracted NFL teams\' interest but they failed to play well when called upon.

That being said, the Jets have now decided to bench their 2021 second-overall pick for the foreseeable future in favor of backup QB Mike White.

Jets bench Zach Wilson and field fourth-string QB vs. Jaguars on TNF  Zach Wilson was benched in favor of Chris Streveler, following a disastrous performance during the first three quarters of the Jacksonville Jaguars vs New York Jets Thursday Night Football game.  Streveler is an undrafted quarterback out of South Dakota. He started his professional career in 2018 with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the CFL. Since 2020, he has also played for the Arizona Cardinals, the Baltimore Ravens and the Miami Dolphins.        Streveler signed with the New York Jets right before the 2022 training camp and put together a slew of great preseason performances. The team decided to release him during the final cuts, but he was signed to the practice squad.           With Mike White injured and out of the game, Streveler got the call-up from the practice squad. When Wilson was benched, Robert Saleh decided to give the quarterback a shot, instead of turning to veteran backup Joe Flacco. Chris Streveler career: Journeyman QB gets shot on primetime vs. Jaguars Jets fans in the stadium were really happy when Zach Wilson was benched. He had one of the worst quarterback performances of the season, completing just 50% of his passes for 92 yards and one interception. Preseason superstar Chris Streveler got a chance to showcase his talents in favor of Wilson. Streveler had already played in seven NFL games during his two years with the Arizona Cardinals but never started. Once he entered the field, there was a clear spark in New York's offense, with the journeyman quarterback completing more passes and adding with his runs.     Before entering the game for the Jets, Streveler had thrown just 25 passes in his NFL career, completing 17 of them for 141 yards, a touchdown and an interception. He's 27 years old. No matter how good Chris Streveler plays against the Jaguars, the fact that Zach Wilson was benched basically ends his Jets career, as harsh as it seems. The former second-overall pick will not start a game as long as Mike White is healthy, and he's probably not starting a game again in 2022.After two awful years with the Jets, it's impossible to believe he will be back in 2023, no matter how much they invested in him.

In the 2017-2018 season, quarterbacks Josh McCown and Bryce Petty threw for a combined 60 yards versus the Denver Broncos in Week 14. All-time, the team has thrown for under 100 yards in 55 games.  Should Joe Flacco become the Jets starter for the rest of the season? While head coach Robert Saleh seems to be sticking with Zach Wilson, the numbers show that the team has played better under Joe Flacco. The former Baltimore Ravens star has started three games this season in place of Wilson. In those three games, Flacco threw for a combined 901 yards, five touchdowns and three interceptions. So far, Wilson has 1,279 yards, four touchdowns, and five interceptions. Joe Flacco also has a lot more experience starting games in this league with 179 career starts and 163 with the Ravens in 11 seasons.

It\'s time to win the games we should win."" Wilson has thrown for under 200 yards passing in a game this season four times, including the loss versus the Patriots. He also hasn\'t thrown a touchdown in four of his last five starts, which was the case against the Patriots. In Week Nine against the Jets, the former BYU star had his lone game with a passer rating of over 100 (101.8 versus the Buffalo Bills).

He led the team to five wins, including a Week 9, 20-17 win against the Buffalo Bills. Under his leadership, the Jets lost two games, both of which were against the New England Patriots.  Wilson had a poor performance in the Week 11 defeat to their AFC East rival, and followed it up with a disastrous press conference. As a result, head coach Robert Saleh announced he was benching Wilson in favor of Mike White.        Wilson was roundly criticized for his refusal to take accountability for a poor offensive display, while the Jets defense limited the Patriots to three points all game. New England won the game 10-3 in the final seconds on a punt return touchdown.           In the postgame interview, a reporter asked Wilson if he felt he had let the defense down. His response was simple: ""No."" Watch the video below, as it was as much his body language as what he said:         So was it entirely that comment that led to his benching, or was there more to the story? Zach Wilson\'s 2022 NFL season stats and Week 12 performance Zach Wilson - New York Jets v Carolina Panthers The Jets have been impressive this season, but Wilson can\'t take too much credit for their change in fortunes. Although they were winning games, they were looking stagnant on offense and some of the issues had to be shouldered by Zach Wilson. It\'s important to note that a season-ending injury to Breece Hall was a major factor in their offensive downturn, but Wilson really didn\'t help himself either.     The Jets entered the regular season with Joe Flacco under center as Wilson suffered a knee injury in the preseason matchup with the Philadelphia Eagles. Flacco went 1-2 before Wilson was ready to play against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 4. Wilson brought the Jets into the limelight as they won their next four games. However, in Week 8, the Patriots defeated the Jets 22-17. Zach Wilson completed only 20 of the 41 passes he attempted. He threw for 355 yards and had two touchdown passes and three interceptions. Those turnovers proved too much for the Jets to overcome.        Following a narrow win over the Buffalo Bills and a bye week, the Jets fell to a disappointing 3-10 loss against the Patriots in Week 11. Wilson completed 9 of 22 passes for 77 yards and the offense gained just two yards after halftime. It was the worst performance of his career and this, along with his postgame comments, caused him to be benched for Week 12 against the Chicago Bears.

While Levis continues to impress everyone with his power and explosiveness, fans on social media compared him to an NFL quarterback.  Levis has drawn comparisons to Josh Allen for Levis, but after seeing his throws during Pro Day, fans compared him to Zach Wilson.

Stroud also performed exceptionally well during their Pro Day workouts. While Stroud and Young are expected to be drafted with the first two overall picks, Will Levis is expected to get drafted a bit later.     Whether or not Levis ends up like Zach Wilson remains to be seen, but the Kentucky quarterback has faced better competition during his college days than the Jets quarterback did with BYU. It will ultimately help him in the NFL as playing in the SEC is the highest level at which a college athlete can play before turning pro.  Analysts have serious doubts about Will Levis' physique Will Levis: NFL Combine Will Levis played well during his time with Kentucky, but many have serious doubts about his chiseled physique. Both Colin Cowherd and Chris Simms have pointed out that not many muscular quarterbacks have performed well in the NFL, which is why Levis could have some difficulties in the future.     Although Levis plays similarly to Josh Allen, it will be difficult to anticipate whether he will perform similarly against superior athletes in the NFL. During his college career, he played 34 games for Penn State and Kentucky in which he threw for 5,876 yards for 46 touchdowns and 25 interceptions.As of now, Levis is projected to be a top-10 pick in the NFL Draft, and the Las Vegas Raiders seem like the best destination for him. Getting drafted by the Raiders will provide him time to develop under Jimmy Garoppolo, but it won't be a surprise if any other team also decides to pursue him.     "", 'Zach Wilson benched: Jets dump QB after terrible outing  Zach Wilson had the chance to get back his starting spot against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was playing having regained the starting spot after Mike White sat out with a rib injury. However, he was extremely poor and failed to pick up multiple blitzes and led the Jets to only three points in a half and some more. The boos were ringing out loudly and there was no way forward for him.  Robert Saleh then made the decision to bench him midway through the game and brought in Chris Streveler as the quarterback instead. He was fourth on the depth chart behind Wilson, Mike White and Joe Flacco. He is a journeyman who has played across many teams, starting as a backup quarterback of the Winnipeg Bombers in the CFL. Yet, despite his previous shortcomings, he was playing way better in the game than Wilson could. It is hard to see how Zach Wilson returns from this ignominy.

Has Zach Wilson been benched before in the regular season? It is always bad when a starting quarterback gets benched mid-season. However, what makes this particularly painful for Zach Wilson is that this is the second time this season that he has been benched. During a particularly painful outing against the Patriots a few weeks ago, he threw for 77 yards and no touchdowns. It was such a poor performance that despite the defense limiting New England to just 10 points, they lost having scored just three. His passer rating was just 50.8.     It was kind of similar to his performance in this game where he threw for 92 yards before being taken off. Worse still, he threw an interception and no touchdowns in this game and left with a passer rating of 41.9. After his performance against the Patriots, Zach Wilson also alienated his teammates by saying he bore no responsiblity for the poor performance in that game. It really upset a lot of people and he was replaced by Mike White as the starter. Wilson only got a chance to return last week after White suffered a rib injury. He was even backed by head coach Robert Saleh to come good by saying he is a serious quarterback who is being judged too harshly. Everything was falling in place for him, but Zach Wilson seems to have blown his chances spectacularly.

With no confirmation of their relationship, fans ended up speculating about the nature of their bond. However, even without the confirmation, fans seem to be all for Team Dellanno. The two have been consistently hanging out, with fans expecting some sort of a reveal soon. Zach Wilson often features on Dellanno\'s Instagram. She was even present at games with the 23-year-old quarterback.     This week, fans seemed particularly interested in Dellanno and her style.

While one can count numerous posts and events as hints, the couple are yet to announce it to their fans. In fact, the young couple could be meaning to keep their relationship under wraps until they decide to take it further. New York Jets v Green Bay Packers On his end, meeting and facing Aaron Rodgers was a dream come true. Wilson\'s father, Mike, confirmed as much in a recent social media post, saying:     ""Dreams do come true! I can’t tell you how many times @ZachWilson and I have watched Rodgers on tv or studied his every movement on YouTube. Today he gets a chance to play against him. Parents, if your child has a dream, embrace it. Sometimes dreams do come true.""  Considering the season\'s progression, fans are certainly expecting more from Zach Wilson.

The Raiders offense mustered only 10 points against a Steelers defense that has given up 22.1 points per game this season. Derek Carr contract: Can the Raiders release him before the 2023 season? The Las Vegas Raiders signed Derek Carr to a three-year, $121.5 million extension in April 2022. But the deal, set to kick in next season, has a clause that gives the Raiders the power to release the quarterback before February 15th and incur only $5 million in dead cap in 2023. The Raiders are 6-9 and doomed to have a losing record this season. They still have a small chance of making it to the playoffs, but it is more likely that the Raiders\' 2022 season is over. Derek Carr has been the franchise\'s cornerstone since he was drafted in 2014, but his nine-year stint with the team could be coming to a close. With Tom Brady set to become a free agent at the end of the season, the Raiders could rekindle their interest in the seven-time Super Bowl champion. That would mean parting ways with their franchise quarterback of almost a decade.     ', ""Derek Carr treating NFL Combine like job fair, insider reports  The NFL Combine is mostly a job fair for players in their 20s, but Derek Carr is repurposing the event to suit his needs.   According to NFL insider Ian Rapoport via Sports Illustrated, the former Raiders quarterback will be meeting with three teams this week and could meet with more.        Carr will be meeting with the New York Jets and the New Orleans Saints for what appears to be a second time and will be introducing himself to the Carolina Panthers for the first time as a free agent as well. It is unknown which other teams he could meet with, but with the entire NFL essentially in one place this week, any option is technically on the table.           Which team will sign Derek Carr?  Instead of getting on a plane to potentially cross the country for a meeting, he could simply take an Uber to get anywhere in the city in under 40 minutes. Meaning, it will be much easier to be available to a wider range of teams.     Dianna Russini@diannaESPNDerek Carr will meet in person with the Saints, Jets, and Panthers at the NFL Combine.

He threw for more than 20 touchdowns and kept the interceptions below 15. However, his record took a sharp decline and his completion percentage also slipped.        In 2021, he went 10-7 and completed 68.4 per cent of his passes. In 2022, he went 6-9 and completed 60.8 per cent of his throws. Fans believe explaining the dropoff will be his biggest obstacle to getting signed.  However, most pundits and fans are ranking the quarterback as one of the top three free agents for 2023. Will teams agree with the assessment?     "", 'Derek Carr proves he\'s still a top quarterback in Pro Bowl showing  The 2023 NFL Pro Bowl event began on February 2 with a skill competition. The AFC took the early lead with significant help from Derek Carr, who scored 31 points in the precision competition.  In an effort to improve the All-Star game, the NFL decided to hold the Pro Bowl over two days: February 2nd for the skill competition between the NFC and AFC, and February 5th for the 7-on-7 flag tournament.        This was Carr\'s fourth Pro Bowl invitation in his nine years with the Las Vegas Raiders and he put up an impressive performance.           With all indications pointing to Derek Carr\'s impending free agency, it felt like an audition for teams to showcase his continued talents as a top quarterback and well-known leadership abilities. He may be the missing piece to lead a team to a championship run.

However, McDaniels stated that the decision was due to the team\'s overall offensive performance and that Carr had played many games, and it was time to see what Stidham could do. As a result, he was made inactive, and the team\'s practice quarterback was promoted to the backup quarterback.     Carr signed a three-year contract extension for $121.5 million that includes a no-trade clause. This means that the team will have to cut him before February 15th unless Carr waives his no-trade clause. If they don\'t, the team would have to pay him $40.4 million over the next two years, which is fully guaranteed. The 31-year-old has stated that he will not be extending his contract deadline. In a statement posted on Twitter, he confirmed his departure from the team. Carr said: ""It breaks my heart I didn\'t get an opportunity to say goodbye in person,"" He also confirmed that he won\'t be retiring by saying this. ""I once said that if I\'m not a Raider I would rather be at home and I meant that, but I never envisioned it ending this way. That fire burning inside of me to win a championship still rages.

Derek Carr took full advantage of it by putting on a passing clinic, where he completed 28 of 37 passes. Carr threw for 382 yards on a staggering 10.3 yards per attempt.

It's only been two games, and the season is still very young, but Carr is the leader in passing yards in the NFL after two games with 817. That's a franchise record for the Las Vegas Raiders. He's also led them to a 2-0 record against two longtime powerhouses in the AFC.     Carr threw over the middle of the defense and didn't just settle for check downs. He was aggressive, as he should've been with the Steelers' losses in their defensive personnel. His touchdown pass to Henry Ruggs III was tied for the longest pass in terms of air yards of his career. Without Haden, the Steelers secondary wouldn't have stood a chance on that deep bomb.

Josh Jacobs didn't play, so Peyton Barber and Kenyan Drake had to carry the load. Barber had 12 runs for a mere 32 yards. Drake faired worse, running seven times for nine yards.

The Las Vegas Raiders will be left with $5.6 million in dead money for the 2023-2024 season. The only provision to that is if Derek Carr gets hurt this season. The remaining $40 million is guaranteed for injury. Carr signed a three-year, $121.5 million contract with the Raiders this offseason. The contract includes a $7.5 million signing bonus, $65.3 million guaranteed, and an average annual salary of $40.5 million.        Should the Raiders not release their star quarterback before February 15, 2023, they will be committing to $32.9 million in base salary in the 2023-2024 season. They will also be committing to $7.5 million of his salary in the 2024-2025 season.  Derek Carr and his performance this season So far this season, Carr has thrown for 2,128 yards, 13 touchdowns, and five interceptions. In the Raiders' loss to the Indianapolis Colts in Week 10, the quarterback threw for 248 yards and two touchdowns. Carr has thrown for at least two touchdowns in a game six times this season.   Based on the numbers, it seems Carr is doing his part, but his contract could find him in a new uniform.

Tom Brady and Mac Jones are two possible options since they are familiar with playing with the Raiders\' head coach, Josh McDaniels. There were also rumors of Brady potentially joining the Raiders before the start of the season before he decided to stay with Tampa Bay.     Jimmy Garoppolo is another name that would make sense as he has also been under McDaniels before as a backup in New England. The Raiders could stick with Stidham, who threw for 656 yards and four touchdowns, with a passer rating of 89.2 in the two games he started.Las Vegas could also use a draft pick to select a rookie quarterback, all we know is they have many options and a lot to explore.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Ian Rapoport and H/T Sportskeeda     ', ""Derek Carr's cold weather stats: How effective is the Raiders QB in subzero temperatures?

Since being selected in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft, Derek Carr has been the team's starting quarterback and has played in seven games in which the temperature was 36 degrees or lower. He has a 0-7 record in these games. He has never scored more than one touchdown or helped his team score more than 19 points in a single game. The Raiders have yet to score more than 17 points in any of those seven games.     It may occasionally be less challenging for players to play outside in the cold. Similar to how it is in the muck and the rain. But things change when you add cold weather—like how frigid it was in Week 17—and gusting winds that reach almost 50 mph. David Willsey@willson8torAll the good Adams and Jacob's did this year only to get cold weather Derek Carr'd and those championship dreams are gone4All the good Adams and Jacob's did this year only to get cold weather Derek Carr'd and those championship dreams are gone https://t.co/8X0PkvZGqp In his seven games played in temperatures below 37 degrees, Derek Carr has only ever tossed one touchdown in each on average, and he has passed for 222 yards only once.     The Raiders and Steelers attacks both labored in Week 16 due to the chilly weather, and this presented the makings of a genuine primetime ice bowl. Both teams' performances were obviously impacted by the cold conditions, which felt like -4 degrees Fahrenheit. Will Derek Carr start in Week 17? In nine years, Derek Carr has sat out just three games—all due to injuries. For the rest of the campaign, the Las Vegas Raiders will start Jarrett Stidham at quarterback instead of nine-year pro Derek Carr, head coach Josh McDaniels announced on Wednesday.

"", ""NFL Week 13: Las Vegas Raiders at New York Jets odds, picks, and predictions  The Las Vegas Raiders suffered a 43-6 beatdown last week. They were dominated by Atlanta Falcons in NFL Week 12. But the Raiders catch a break this week. They travel to MetLife Stadium to take on the winless New York Jets. Many fans think this year's Jets could be one of the worst teams in NFL history.  Quarterback Sam Darnold's return did little to aid the Jets' quest for a victory. Darnold struggled to throw the football with any real consistency. After a 20-3 loss to the Miami Dolphins, New York remains stuck at the bottom of the AFC East. The mere fact that veteran running back Frank Gore is still the Jets' most consistent performer says everything you need to know about this deficient offense.        As for coach Jon Gruden's Raiders, everything seemed to go wrong last week. They were unable to run the ball, so they resorted to a one-dimensional passing offense. To beat the Jets, Las Vegas will have to play better on both offense and defense. With a win, the Raiders' playoff chances remain solid. Without one, Las Vegas might have to hit the panic button.           The experts weighed in for #LVvsNYJ.

Every team faces unique challenges and are in different situations currently. These five NFL players need to up their game in Week 10 and bring more value to their respective teams.  NFL Players who need a big performance in Week 10                   #1 - QB Derek Carr, Las Vegas Raiders The Las Vegas Raiders have faced a ton of adversity this season between controversial situations such as Jon Gruden, Henry Ruggs III and Damon Arnette. They still sit at the top of the AFC West, tied with the Los Angeles Chargers. They have an opportunity in Week 10 at home for Sunday Night Football against their division rivals, the Kansas City Chiefs, for a statement win. In the face of adversity, the quarterback needs to step up. Derek Carr is the leader of the Raiders. He needs to rally the team to bounce back after a disappointing loss last week against the New York Giants.  #2 - QB Mike White, New York Jets There is a ton of hype around Mike White after his impressive performance against the Cincinnati Bengals. He will now face the Buffalo Bills in Week 10 after being named the starting quarterback. If he can prove that one game is not a fluke, he could increase his own overall value moving forward. Rookie Zach Wilson is out with an injury but has struggled to perform this season.

Alvin Kamara is already a featured piece of the Saints offense but he's going to have to step it up another level. The Saints need him now more than ever.

The Saints are in good shape to make a playoff appearance right now so they don't want to let that slip away with Winston's injury. They suffered a disappointing loss to the Atlanta Falcons last week but will look to bounce back in Week 10 against the surging Tennessee Titans. They will need a huge performance from Kamara.  #4 - QB P.J. Walker, Carolina Panthers Sam Darnold has struggled heavily over his last few games but has now been diagnosed with an injury and will miss time. P.J. Walker will get the starting quarterback job for Week 10 against the Arizona Cardinals. It's a difficult matchup but the Carolina Panthers need to get their momentum back. They have lost five of their last six games.#5 - RB James Conner, Arizona CardinalsThe Arizona Cardinals offense is dealing with a ton of injuries. James Conner came up big last week in an increased role to help the depleted Cardinals earn a victory. He will get his first start of the season in Week 10 with a chance to build off his performance last week.     ""]"
80,Kenny Pickett,"[""Kenny Pickett's performance proves Steelers have a potential answer but not solution for Ben Roethlisberger's replacement  Kenny Pickett was selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was the organization's choice to take over as their future franchise quarterback following the retirement of Ben Roethlisberger during the 2022 NFL offseason. Roethlisberger retired after spending his entire 18 year career with the Steelers.  While Pickett would be tasked with filling big shoes, he didn't open the season as the starting quarterback. Instead, the Steelers named Mitchell Trubisky the Week 1 starter after signing him during the 2022 free agency period.        Trubisky struggled in his short time as the starting quarterback for the Steelers, losing two of his first three games. He entered a favorable match-up at home in Week 4 against the New York Jets, but failed to impress. By the end of the first half, the Steelers were trailing by a 10-6 score. This triggered head coach Mike Tomlin to make a change, bringing in rookie Kenny Pickett to replace Trubisky.           Pickett's NFL career got off to the roughest of starts as he threw an interception on his very first passing attempt ever. He would go on to complete ten of his 13 passing attempts for 120 yards, but all three of his incompletions were intercepted by the Jets defense. On a more positive note, Pickett recorded two rushing touchdowns. Dov Kleiman@NFL_DovKleimanThat was quick... Kenny Pickett throws an INT on his first drive in the NFL Was his first pass in the NFL.38362That was quick... Kenny Pickett throws an INT on his first drive in the NFL Was his first pass in the NFL.https://t.co/Sxvi9vsWsy     It was a mixed performance for Pickett, who failed to complete the comeback against the Jets. Instead, the Steelers lost their third consecutive game. While it was only one half, Pickett will need to play much better moving forward. Especially if he's going to follow in Ben Roethlisberger's footsteps, which include two Super Bowl rings.     It's unclear at this point if Kenny Pickett will be named the starting quarterback moving forward or if the Steelers will give Trubisky another shot first, but an announcement by Mike Tomlin can be expected sometime prior to the Week 5 game. It will be a tough task for whoever gets named the starter, facing off against the Buffalo Bills, one of the best teams in the NFL with the top-ranked defense from a season ago.     Which teams passed on Kenny Pickett? Pittsburgh QB Kenny Pickett Pickett was the only quarterback selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft, going to the Steelers with the 20th overall pick. Several teams ahead of the Steelers in the draft order were rumored to be interested in drafting a quarterback in the first round, but ultimately decided to pass on Pickett.         The Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, and Seattle Seahawks all decided to pass on quarterbacks, filling other roster needs instead. Other teams that passed on Pickett in the first round drafted quarterbacks later. These were the Atlanta Falcons (Desmond Ridder), the Carolina Panthers (Matt Corral), and the Washington Commanders (Sam Howell). The Tennessee Titans also decided to take a quarterback later in the draft when Malik Willis fell to them in the third round. They weren't necessarily in the market for one, so didn't really pass on Pickett, but capitalized on drafting Willis for value where they got him. The New England Patriots similarly drafted Bailey Zappe in the fourth round, before a trio of speculative quarterbacks were selected late in the seventh round. Does Kenny Pickett really have small hands? Kenny Pickett at the 2022 NFL Combine     Kenny Pickett's hands measured in at just 8.5 inches during the 2022 NFL Combine. He officially has the smallest hands of any quarterback currently playing in the NFL, making his grip on the football a potential issue moving forward. While his hands are extremely small compared to other NFL quarterbacks, it's debatable how much of an impact that really has on a player's abilities. It's certain that the Steelers would have drafted him if they had any concerns about this. They scouted him thoroughly and would have watched endless tape of his college days before reaching a decision.It was great to see the rookie get on the field, although his debut didn't quite go to plan. We will see him develop and perhaps start some games in the near future.     "", 'Kenny Pickett shined at the combine  Yesterday, QB\'s WR\'s and TE\'s had on-field drills at the combine showcasing their talent during the combine. Many top players in their positions participated in these live drills and one prospect that stood out was Pitt\'s\' Kenny Pickett.  Gregg Cossell on Ross Tucker Football Podcast said that Pickett stood out the most to him and that he benefits from playing with Mark Whipple, who\'s coached in the NFL.        ""I would say Kenny Pickett is the one who stood out to me the most. Don\'t forget he played for Mark Whipple, who was the offensive coordinator at the University of Pittsburgh and Mark Whipple, as you know, played, well coached in the NFL. So Pickett was efficient from the pocket with a profile that I think is demanded at the NFL level,"" said Cossell.           Cossell adds that Pickett has good instincts with a good sense of timing, anticipation, and ball placement. ""He played with vision progression reading, there were full field reading concepts within the Pittsburgh passing game. He had a sense of timing. He had a sense of anticipation. For the most part, he had precise ball placement. He was athletic and he had mobility to be a secondary action playmaker. He can be very effective as an executer and ball distributor and that\'s where his game starts,"" Cossell added.     Pickett is expected to be the first quarterback to come off the board. He\'s the most pro-ready prospect of all quarterback prospects and could be a top-10 pick. Pickett was a four-year starter at Pitt starting in 49 games while throwing for 12,303 yards and 81 touchdowns and had a completion percentage of 62.4. Pickett has good size for a pro quarterback at 6\'3 and 220 lbs. Kenny Pickett has the smallest hands in the draft Kenny Pickett Throwing 2022 NFL Combine     Yesterday, it was revealed that Pickett currently has the smallest hands in the NFL after measurements.

Former Atlanta Falcons head coach Mike Smith was impressed by Kenny Pickett\'s performance last Saturday. On the latest episode of Sportskeeda\'s ""BallFather"" podcast, he lauded the quarterback, saying: ""This is a quarterback-driven league. And there are occasionally a few teams that can win with multiple quarterbacks.     ""But you\'ve got to have a quarterback 99% of the time if you\'re going to be successful, and when you lose one like Ben Roethlisberger, it\'s going to take some time to get the new player, the new quarterback and whoever it is indoctrinated into the system.

King said:        ""As far as a football fit goes, I can tell you that they have been sort of interested in Kenny Pickett for a long time. They obviously didn\'t want anybody to know because they didn\'t want to have to trade up for it. So they put out every smokescreen there was.""           He went on to describe how they did it: ""They went and had a great meal with Malik Willis and all these other guys but they knew for quite a while that this is the guy they really want.""

Mike Tomlin stated that Pickett is ready for the NFL and loves how he\'s a ridiculous competitor. Tomlin said: ""We thought he had pro-level anticipation. We thought he had pro-level accuracy. Often times, those are two variables that really require a lot of adjustment from a quarterbacking standpoint. We felt he came ready-made in those ways. Hopefully, that\'s an asset to him in terms of being able to compete and being ready, if his performance dictates it. "" He went on to say: ""One of the things that was very evident about Kenny being next door is he\'s just a ridiculous competitor, so we\'re just excited about putting him in the mix and watching him compete against Mitch and Mason and seeing where that leads us.""     Pittsburgh signed Mitchell Trubisky to a two-year deal in the off-season as insurance for the position. It will be a battle between Pickett and Trubisky in training camp to see who wins the starting job.Pittsburgh finished last season 9-7-1 before being eliminated 42-21 by the Kansas City Chiefs in the wildcard round. The Steelers will be looking to hit the ground running with a new quarterback, following Roethlisberger\'s retirement.

The second-year quarterback then proceeded to shotgun a beer alongside Combs, exciting the Pittsburgh crowd immensely.            Pat McAfee, a Pittsburgh native himself, said that he loved that Pickett got involved in the concert that way. He also admired Pickett for being proud to be the Steelers quarterback.            “Kenny Pickett being your quarterback, doing this is so fu**ing cool I bet for the entire city of Pittsburgh, not to say that Ben Roethlisberger wasn\'t there, he was with his cowboy hat… but Kenny Pickett literally walking around saying, I\'m proud to be the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback.  ""I am going to shotgun beers. I will get a suite for me and the boys will enjoy life a little bit. He\'s old school with what happened in the draft. You got to be pumped with the state of the Pittsburgh Steelers.”        The Pittsburgh Steelers are expecting a lot out of the quarterback who will get the opportunity to start in Week 1 of the upcoming season.

The Raiders offense mustered only 10 points against a Steelers defense that has given up 22.1 points per game this season. Derek Carr contract: Can the Raiders release him before the 2023 season? The Las Vegas Raiders signed Derek Carr to a three-year, $121.5 million extension in April 2022. But the deal, set to kick in next season, has a clause that gives the Raiders the power to release the quarterback before February 15th and incur only $5 million in dead cap in 2023. The Raiders are 6-9 and doomed to have a losing record this season. They still have a small chance of making it to the playoffs, but it is more likely that the Raiders\' 2022 season is over. Derek Carr has been the franchise\'s cornerstone since he was drafted in 2014, but his nine-year stint with the team could be coming to a close. With Tom Brady set to become a free agent at the end of the season, the Raiders could rekindle their interest in the seven-time Super Bowl champion. That would mean parting ways with their franchise quarterback of almost a decade.     ', 'Who is Kenny Pickett\'s fiancee Amy Paternoster?

That’s where his biggest knock is when it comes to hand size/throwing power. He’s the best in this class at accuracy/reading defenses, but that deep ball into tighter NFL windows still a question. But that shouldn\'t be too much of a knock on him considering he is better known for his pocket mobility and ability to read defenses. Amy Paternoster certainly seems to think so. Amy Paternoster and Kenny Pickett: the story so far     2021 ACC Championship - Pittsburgh v Wake Forest Kenny Pickett and Amy Paternoster\'s journey started at the University of Pittsburgh. While he was their star quarterback, she engaged herself in a different form of football, playing soccer for the university team.

View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Kenny Pickett started 49 games for the Pittsburgh Panthers, winning 33 games. He threw for 12,303 yards during that time and completed 62.4 percent of his attempts by throwing 1045 completions in 1674 attempts. He had 81 touchdowns to 32 interceptions and an average passer rating of 136.3. In 2021, he had a passer rating of 165.3, completing 42 touchdowns for just 7 interceptions. He went 11-2 in 2021. Amy Paternoster has been active with the Pittsburgh Tigers soccer team, playing as an attacking midfielder for them. She has scored three goals and contributed five assists. For the moment, though, it seems she is more concerned with her fiance\'s playing career, as he participates in one of the most important events of his nascent career. It will determine his NFL draft position and his future career. At a time when he has been scrutinized for things beyond his control, like his hand size that measures only 8 1/2 inches and is smaller than any NFL quarterback, knowing that someone unconditionally backs you can mean the world to someone.Pickett is fortunate that he has found such a supportive partner with whom he hopes to spend the rest of his life.

The 33-year-old who hasn\'t played a down in the NFL since 2021 took part in several quarterback drills Tuesday.  After he went viral saying there aren\'t 32 quarterbacks better than him on Monday, Newton went to work at the pro day, and NFL fans came away from his workout with one thing stuck in their minds: He can still throw the football.        While it is fine throwing against air, when the time comes to play against other defenders, that is where the real test is for the 33-year-old.

It remains to be seen whether the veteran quarterback will get another chance in the NFL, but he is putting his best foot forward in an attempt to get back into the league.  Could Cam Newton sign with a team in 2023? Carolina Panthers QB Cam Newton Given that Cam Newton hasn\'t played an NFL snap since 2021, teams could be hesitant to give the veteran a roster spot. Not seen as a backup quarterback in the NFL due to his charisma and energy, would a team be comfortable with having Newton as a backup?        The other point is, what would the contract offer look like? At first glance, it would likely have to be a veteran\'s minimum contract, and it\'s unclear if Cam Newton would be willing to accept that kind of deal.        The fire still burns to return to the NFL, but his record since 2019 doesn\'t make for good reading. Newton is 7-16 as a starter, which doesn\'t bode well for his chances.Will there be a market for Newton? We await with anticipation.

Despite being one of the best quarterbacks to have ever played professional football, Newton's college career didn't go as smoothly as one would expect.  Newton played his four-season college football career with three different programs from 2007 to 2010. The quarterback was fazed by issues that required him to switch colleges. However, he ended his college career as a Heisman Trophy winner and led Auburn to the national title in 2010 before becoming the No. 1 pick in the 2011 draft.

He was recruited as a backup to the established Tim Tebow, the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner and a two-time All-American who led Florida to two national titles. Newton was able to showcase his talent despite his status as a backup. He performed well in the five games he played as a freshman. However, Newton's time at Florida was short-lived after he was arrested on felony charges after stealing a laptop from another student on campus in 2008. Those chargers were later dropped.

He broke the Patriots franchise record for the longest run by a QB, which was a 49-yard run in the first quarter.

I\'ll be rooting for him wherever he goes.— Tanya Ray Fox (@TanyaRayFox) January 3, 2021  What is next for Cam Newton?     Reports have surfaced that the Patriots will likely part ways with Newton after just one season. Considering the deal he was on, the Patriots certainly got their money\'s worth for the one-year deal Newton signed. As he had stated early this season, it was a ""business trip"" for Newton, to show the league he still has some gas left in his tank. Could Cam Newton retire after this season? It could be possible, but he will likely want to continue playing. Considering the scheme he entered into, it was unlikely for there to be any success offensively for Bill Belichick. One team that immediately could consider Cam Newton is the Washington Football Team. Considering Ron Rivera coached the Carolina Panthers for several years with Newton as the starting quarterback and went to the Super Bowl with him, it would only make sense for a reunion in Washington. It would bring some QB competition as well if Washington were to trade or draft a younger QB.     ', 'Anthony Richardson vs Cam Newton: Comparing Gators QB\'s combine performance against former Auburn star  Anthony Richardson is one of the most polarizing prospects of the 2023 NFL draft. The former Florida Gators quarterback is touted as a first-round quarterback, but there are doubts about whether his skills will be able to translate to the NFL.  Richardson\'s performance at the 2023 NFL Scouting Combine on Saturday should improve his draft stock after a fantastic day. While his athletic ability was never in doubt, he broke long-standing records and his blazing speed caught the attention of observers.        The 21-year-old broke the record of the longest vertical jump for any quarterback since 2003 by scoring a 40.5\'\' jump. The 6\'4\'\' quarterback also ran an excellent 4.44 in the 40-yard dash, one of the fastest-ever for a passer. Anthony Richardson\'s athletic excellence drew comparisons to other former Florida quarterback, Cam Newton.            Both are two strong-armed quarterbacks with threatening rushing ability. How do the two players compare in their Combine performances?  Is Anthony Richardson more athletic than Cam Newton? Comparing the two quarterbacks Although the latest Florida quarterback broke the vertical jump record today, he\'s very similar to Cam in many athletic aspects NFL Research@NFLResearchAnthony Richardson just broke the record for the highest vertical jump (40.5"") by any QB at the combine since at least 2003 @FloridaGators #NFLCombine67597Anthony Richardson just broke the record for the highest vertical jump (40.5"") by any QB at the combine since at least 2003 @FloridaGators #NFLCombine https://t.co/cmWChmoqq0     When Newton performed in 2011, he all but cemented his status as the first overall pick for that year\'s draft. His only real competitor that year was Blaine Gabbert, who ended up in the 10th overall pick with the Jacksonville Jaguars - Jake Locker was taken with the eighth overall pick by the Tennessee Titans. Anthony Richardson\'s competition is higher this year, as Alabama\'s Bryce Young and Ohio State\'s CJ Stroud are set to be the first two quarterbacks taken. However, the excellent Combine performance alongside his great work ethic and some good interviews can improve his stock even further, perhaps landing him in the draft\'s top 5. Having a good athletic profile can cut you a lot of flack in the league, especially as it relates to things such as completing passes in short windows or escaping the pocket to get yards on the move. These are two things that Newton was excellent at, and the Florida star can become a great quarterback with the same playing style.

In the fourth quarter of the New England Patriots\' 24-3 loss to the Los Angeles Rams on ""Thursday Night Football,"" Patriots coach Bill Belichick pulled quarterback Cam Newton.  Newton didn\'t play well on Thursday. He completed nine of 16 passes for just 119 yards, no touchdowns and one interception, which was taken back for a touchdowns by the Rams.        Before Thursday night\'s game, Cam Newton was questionable due to an abdomen injury that was suffered in Week 9 of the 2020 NFL Season.           This could be the reasoning behind why the veteran quarterback was benched, but a lot of Patriots fans say otherwise.

Cam Newton has not been the same football player since missing time due to the coronavirus. Since Week 3 of the 2020 NFL Season, Cam Newton has thrown 8 interceptions and three touchdowns.

Newton failed to score a touchdown through the air and on the ground. Cam Newton did throw two interceptions against the Arizona Cardinals. Although the Patriots beat the Cardinals, Newton\'s performance was not great. In Week 13, Cam Newton would throw a passing touchdown and rush for two touchdowns. The New England Patriots would beat the Los Angeles Chargers 45-0. The problem was Cam Newtons passing yards, he recorded back-to-back games without passing over 100 yards.     Week 14, New England Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick would pull Cam Newton in the fourth quarter. Cam Newton threw for 119 yards and rushed for 16 yards, but threw a costly interception that was returned for a Rams touchdown. The struggles for Newton continued in Week 14. In the 2020 NFL Season, Cam Newton has passed for 2,172 yards, five touchdowns and 10 interceptions. Where Newton has made his money is on the ground. The Patriots\' quarterback has rushed 113 times for 451 yards and 11 touchdowns this season. After all the workout videos posted in the offseason and after the hot start to the 2020 NFL Season, Newton seems to be back to his old ways. Carolina moved off the quarterback because his performance was declining. If there is one coach that will not put up with Newton declining its Bill Belichick. Bill Belichick went to the post game conference after Week 14\'s game against the Los Angeles Rams to tell everyone that Cam Newton was still the starter. This is because Belichick does not have enough confidence in Jared Stidham. Belichick has something up his sleeve because he is not the coach to let a player stay on his team if he\'s declining in performance.      Injuries have hindered Cam Newton In Week 3 of the 2020 NFL Season, Cam Newton had to miss time because of the coronavirus. Newton would not return to the Patriots lineup until October 12th and would start against the Denver Broncos. This may not be an injury from football but it impacted Cam Newtons 2020 NFL Season. In Week 11 of the 2020 NFL Season, Cam Newton would appear on the New England Patriots injury report. He was questionable for the game against the Arizona Cardinals. The injury report read that Newton was questionable because of his abdomen. How much the abdomen impacting Cam Newton\'s play?Newton: ""None.""Is he dealing with pain?Newton: ""It\'s not for me to talk about those types of things.""— Henry McKenna (@McKennAnalysis) December 11, 2020     Newton would appear on the injury report for both Week 13 and Week 14. The injury report again read about the abdomen injury. Cam Newton has dismissed anything and everything about being in pain. He has dismissed that his abdomen has anything to do with his struggles. It has been noted that Cam Newton is in more pain than he is saying. His abdomen injury could have a big role in why he is not throwing the football well. Newton is known to play through injury and to not share a lot of information with the press. Whether Cam Newton is in pain or not in pain, he is not going to let it out. Especially beings he is trying to revamp his career and is trying to stay on an NFL roster.Also Read: What is Cam Newton\'s Contract Breakdown?

In his place, Jacoby Brissett stepped up and put together a rough performance, throwing for 169 yards and an interception en route to a Week Two loss. The performance sets a dark tone for the near future.  The Dolphins, a win-now organization in 2021, could be looking to the market for anyone who can give the team a boost to weather the injury. Luckily for them, Cam Newton is available just weeks after being cut in New England. Would Cam Newton be a good fit with the Dolphins?        Dolphins diving deep for Cam Newton?           The Patriots and the Dolphins are sworn enemies but the modern-day Dolphins are heavily influenced by the team. Their head coach, Brian Flores, was a position coach under Bill Belichick. The Dolphins' roster is also sprinkled with ex-Patriots, including Jacoby Brissett, Eric Rowe and Jason McCourty. If the Patriots have already permeated the team, why not sign another ex-Patriot?

If Cam were surrounded with level of talent Kirk Cousins has had in his career, he’d have a couple SB rings. The special advantage of signing Cam Newton is getting an inside scoop on the team. Of course, the Dolphins defeated the Patriots in Week 1, but the win was largely a result of Mac Jones' first start. He may be much different by the next time the two teams play. Anything the Dolphins can do to stay ahead of the Patriots should be done.     As an added bonus, by signing Cam Newton, the Dolphins would be keeping the Patriots from re-signing the quarterback if they change their minds. If something were to happen to Mac Jones, the Patriots would have no choice but to lean on Brian Hoyer. This would keep the Patriots down while keeping the Dolphins up.     The Dolphins are serious about the playoffs this season, so it makes sense to sign a quarterback who has plenty of playoff experience. It may have been a while for Cam Newton, but he has already shown he can perform in the playoffs. He knows how to deal with the pressure of the moment and can provide advice to Tagovailoa if he makes the playoffs.     Cam Newton after Super Bowl 50 between Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos Lastly, if the Dolphins somehow make the Super Bowl with Newton, they would have a quarterback who could deal with that pressure. He's already been there and, having lost one, his level of focus could elevate to a higher level. Needless to say, if Newton were to find himself in the Super Bowl again, he would dive on the fumble.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 3 TV Schedule     "", ""Which team would be the perfect fit for Cam Newton?  Cam Newton's stint with the New England Patriots came to a surprising end as the quarterback was released to reach the 53-man roster limit.  Newton was the Patriots' starting quarterback for the 2020 season and entered a battle with rookie Mac Jones for the job in the pre-season, which Jones definitely won today with the veteran's release. The 2015 NFL MVP made some good appearances in the pre-season, but New England decided to focus on the future and give Jones the most snaps he can take as a rookie.        It's also worth noting that even though Newton seems to be healthier than 2020, Jones gives the Patriots the best chance to win in 2021.           There wasn't just one reason that Cam Newton is gone. It was a combination of at least three, I'm told: Mac Jones' emergence, Newton's vaccination stance (which caused a bit of a stir behind the scenes) and Cam's uninspiring performance this summer.— Adam Beasley (@AdamHBeasley) August 31, 2021 However, a question arises with Newton's release: which team would be the best fit for the veteran in 2021? Washington Football Team the most logic spot for Newton With the regular season only nine days away, there aren't a lot of spots that make sense for Newton to be in. Washington is the outlier in that sense.     Connections with coach Ron Rivera, who drafted and coached Newton for the Carolina Panthers from 2011 to 2019, made it a possibility when the veteran first became a free agent in March 2020. A deal was never reached because Washington had Dwayne Haskins on the roster and they focused on developing the young quarterback, but things went south from there. The situation is different now, as Newton knows he'll have to settle for a backup role if he wants to play in 2021. Ryan Fitzpatrick, Washington's starter, has been kind of a journeyman during his career, and we can never discard the possibility of Fitzpatrick being benched. Super Bowl 50 - Carolina Panthers v Denver Broncos     If Newton joins Washington, he'll be on a team where the backup position is valuable and, if something happens to Fitzpatrick, whether he gets injured or is benched for a poor performance, Newton would play for a team that gives him an opportunity to compete for a playoff spot. A couple of factors in play with releasing Cam Newton rather than keeping him on as the Patriots' backup: His command of the locker room, and his vaccination status. Neither make him an ideal choice as a backup behind a rookie QB.— Doug Kyed (@DougKyed) August 31, 2021 Newton needs to settle for a backup role With the regular season only a few days away, Newton won't be the presumed starter for any team, even those with a murky quarterback situation.     This is not a position like offensive lineman or kickers, where it doesn't take much to learn the system and you can just go out and perform. Quarterbacks are the most important pieces on a team and it always takes some time to learn the playbook.That's why Washington is the best landing spot for Newton. He's already familiar with the coaching staff. He'll have a shot at playing during the season, considering who their starter is.But if the veteran thinks he'll be able to find a starting spot in the league, even after a decent pre-season, he's setting himself up for disappointment.     "", 'Cam Newton could retire from the NFL  Former NFL MVP Cam Newton could have played his last down in the NFL. Having struggled for game time and performance over the last couple of seasons, he was benched for Sam Darnold this season as he threw four touchdowns and five interceptions in his five games this year.  Newton spoke to Jonathan Jones of CBS Sports and was asked if he had any football left in him.        ""Do I have a lot of football [left]? Do I want to play? Yeah,"" he said. ""But under the right conditions. I have to sit down with my family, my counsel, and just decide.""           Jonathan Jones@jjones9Cam Newton: Do I have a lot of football [left]? Do I want to play?

But under the right conditions. I have to sit down with my family, my counsel, and just decide. Will Cam Newton find a new team? Over the next couple of weeks, NFL teams will be evaluating their rosters and looking at where they can improve. There are several teams that could use a new quarterback, but will a 32-year-old be the answer?     Washington need a new quarterback; so do the Steelers and the Texans (if Mills is not the answer), and potentially the Seahawks, depending on what Russell Wilson does. The Panthers are still unsure over their options going forward. Sam Darnold started 3-0 this season before the wheels fell off and Cam looked shaky in the offense.

I can tell you that now.""#NFL I @wcnc I #Panthers https://t.co/o19XF7CaHm The big question will be whether Newton sees himself as a starter or if he is content being a back-up. His charisma and stature suggest he needs to be a starter, but there could be only a handful of jobs available, if any; so being a back up could be a viable option.     Since his 2015 MVP season, in which he led the Panthers to a 15-1 record and a Super Bowl appearance, Cam has been on a downwards trajectory. In his MVP year, he threw for 35 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions, but he has not gotten close to those touchdown numbers since. Several teams will see the 32-year-old as a bonafide back-up option should their starter go down. That could even be in Carolina, but the lack of on-field production will cause some hesitation. If Cam is to call it a day and retire from the league, he will go down as one of the most polarizing figures the game has seen. He made his name as one of the first dual-threat quarterbacks who could throw as well as he could run. Panthers 24/7@Panthers24_72013 Monday Night Football.

83,Davis Mills,"[""As the Texans eye the 2023 NFL Draft, Davis Mills is down but not out  It's been a strange two seasons for Davis Mills in the NFL. Quarterbacking one of the most overlooked franchises in the NFL isn't easy, with every defeat further knocking a fragile confidence.  The Houston Texans finished the 2022 season with an almost inexplicable victory over the Indianapolis Colts. It was a win that cost them the first-overall pick in the 2023 draft. While the Chicago Bears were doubtless the real winners of that crazy AFC South showdown, Davis Mills may also benefit.        The Bears will likely trade the number-one pick for as much as they can get, as they will almost certainly go forward with Justin Fields under center. The Texans, however, are looking to the draft for a new quarterback. While Houston could send draft capital to Chicago for pole position, this feels unlikely.           As does trading for Lamar Jackson or Aaron Rodgers and going for Jimmy Garoppolo doesn't make total sense. These are targets for teams that are looking to win now and the Texans are rebuilding. Drew@IndepthTexansThe Houston Texans have now met with all of the 4 top QB’s in the NFL Draft:•Bryce Young •C.J Stroud •Anthony Richardson •Will LevisVery likely one of these 4 will be the Texans next QB and or selection with the number 2 overall pick in the draft23322The Houston Texans have now met with all of the 4 top QB’s in the NFL Draft:•Bryce Young •C.J Stroud •Anthony Richardson •Will LevisVery likely one of these 4 will be the Texans next QB and or selection with the number 2 overall pick in the draft https://t.co/Eo2YTyszGX     Whoever does get the first-overall pick is expected to take Bryce Young, which suggests CJ Stroud will become a Texan. Regardless of which QB they draft, this is bad news for Davis Mills. However, he may yet get another chance to prove himself. Bringing in a rookie QB is highly unlikely to turn Houston into immediate Super Bowl contenders, for there are needs to address throughout their roster. With a new head coach and plenty of decent picks, they will be an interesting team to watch. But chucking a rookie quarterback into the fray could do more harm than good. Blooding the rookies throughout their rebuilding roster will be a must, but being careful with their biggest investment is key. Mills was sacked 31 times in each of his two campaigns, and the franchise will test its offensive line before throwing a new man into the mix. The Texans would be wise to tread carefully with their rookie's confidence. There's a fine line between learning from your mistakes and developing a complex. Many a QB has been ruined by a losing side and Houston will measure their new man's mettle carefully.        As such, don't be surprised if the Texans take their time introducing a new man under center and we may see Mills start the season. There is certainly precedence for patience with rookies, as seen by multiple quarterbacks currently in the league.  Rookie quarterbacks often sit behind veterans Los Angeles Rams v New York Giants     Obviously, not every player will see the success of Patrick Mahomes, who sat behind Alex Smith for his first campaign. Nor will the new Texans QB necessarily turn into Aaron Rodgers, who was Brett Favre's understudy (not exactly willingly by either player) for years. Kenny Pickett had to wait for his chance behind Mitch Trubisky for the Pittsburgh Steelers, as did Malik Willis and Desmond Ridder (Tennessee Titans and Atlanta Falcons, respectively). Jared Goff didn't make an appearance for the Los Angeles Rams until the franchise lost patience with Case Keenum midway through the 2016 season. Trey Lance also sat a season behind Jimmy Garoppolo. The point here is that there is a good chance Houston will give Davis Mills opportunities this season. They may want to let their rookie find his feet in the NFL before naming him the starter, or ensure his head doesn't drop if things go wrong. Looking at the last two seasons, Davis Mills is well worth keeping around for the Texans, especially on his rookie deal.      Davis Mills might not resurrect the Texans, but he can help them through a transitional phase Davis Mills - Philadelphia Eagles v Houston Texans Houston have struggled for multiple seasons, with their last playoff appearance coming in the 2019 campaign. Deshaun Watson recorded an individually memorable 2020 campaign, but the Texans finished 4-12. With Watson sitting out a season before being traded to Cleveland, Houston had a gap to fill at quarterback.     Davis Mills was drafted by the franchise in the third round in 2021 behind several quarterbacks. This list includes Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson, Trey Lance, Justin Fields, Mac Jones, Kyle Trask, and Kellen Mond. Mills was taken 67th and not a whole lot was expected of him or the Texans. In his rookie season, he was something of a surprise package. Mills started the campaign behind Tyrod Taylor before taking the starting role (after an injury and some poor play by Taylor). Mills threw for a respectable 2,664 yards and 16 touchdowns against 10 interceptions. He went for a disappointing 2-9 as a starter, but given how low expectations were for him and the Texans, Mills was given quite a lot of credit. In the last campaign, Davis Mills threw for 3,118 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. There were concerns with his play and analysts were reluctant to give him a pass this time. Talks that maybe Mills could be the man under center long-term stopped, and as the losses piled up, people started to look to the 2023 draft.     That said, Mills had some decent highlights last season, especially in both games against the Colts. Quarterbacking the Texans was a thankless task in the 2022 campaign, and it could have gone a lot worse. # 2 Pick In Draft@AYOTexanNationSome Big boy throws from Davis Mills week 1 vs Colts ! 23-37 / 240 Yards/ 2TD 0ints / 98.9 PRLeft some plays out there but all in all had a solid game #WeAreTexans17729Some Big boy throws from Davis Mills week 1 vs Colts ! 23-37 / 240 Yards/ 2TD 0ints / 98.9 PRLeft some plays out there but all in all had a solid game👊 #WeAreTexans https://t.co/govqbBU56c Davis Mills could be very useful in getting the Texans through a transitional phase (as they look to go from early draft pickers to AFC South contenders). He's a cost-effective, willing, and serviceable option while the Texans prepare their new man for life in the NFL.His performances certainly weren't awful and with his future on the line (along with a better roster), it's possible that he will improve markedly in the 2023 campaign.

Unlike the Cowboys, the Houston Texans are heading into their preseason finale undefeated. With everything the Texans have gone through this offseason, finishing their preseason undefeated will be a massive win. The Texans may not be a dumpster fire after all.        Here are three observations from the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans' Week 2 preseason matchup.            Houston Texans rookie QB Davis Mills has shined during the preseason #1 Houston Texans starting QB job looks to belong to Davis Mills The Houston Texans entered their offseason with a massive question mark next to their quarterback position. One thing that was for sure in Houston was that Deshaun Watson wouldn't be playing. That left the Houston Texans with Davis Mills, Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel.     All three of Davis Mills' longest completions tonight are play-action strikes. pic.twitter.com/OpTTA9LAeo— Rivers McCown (@riversmccown) August 22, 2021 Davis Mills has outperformed both Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel over the last two preseason games. Mills completed 11 of his 22 passes for 112 yards and an interception against the Packers in Week 1. He followed that above-average performance by completing ten of his sixteen passes for 115 yards against the Cowboys. It looks like Davis Mills will head into Week 1 of the regular season as the starting quarterback in Houston. That's if a miracle doesn't happen and Deshaun Watson suddenly changes his mind.      #2 Dallas Cowboys are still searching for Dak Prescott's backup The Dallas Cowboys headed into their preseason matchup with the Houston Texans with three quarterbacks battling for one job. That job is backing up their franchise quarterback Dak Prescott. Garrett Gilbert, Cooper Rush and Ben DiNucci are all fighting for the backup role. COWBOYS GAME REPLAY 🎬: Cooper Rush connects with Cedrick Wilson for the go ahead TD! ✭ #dallascowboys pic.twitter.com/Sb0K4UbAuG— The Cowboys Network (@TheCowboysNet) August 22, 2021 After the Hall of Fame Game, it looked like Garrett Gilbert would run away with the job. Cooper Rush bounced back against the Cardinals to prove he's not out of the race just yet. Ben DiNucci led the Cowboys in passing yards against the Texans, but he threw three interceptions.     With the Cowboys' preseason finale approaching quickly, Josh Rosen is starting to look even better. All three quarterbacks have had good and bad performances, making the Cowboys' backup quarterback spot an open race heading into their finale against Jacksonville.  #3 Dallas Cowboys haven't scored a rushing touchdown during the preseason The Dallas Cowboys fan base has been focused on the quarterback position and their defense. That has taken the attention away from their rushing attack. Dallas hasn't recorded a rushing touchdown in its three preseason games. Ezekiel Elliott hasn't appeared in any of the Cowboys' preseason games, but that doesn't take away their struggles. The Cowboys need their run game if they want Dak to have a successful season. With one preseason game left, the Cowboys will need their run game to find the end zone to build momentum heading into the upcoming season.Also Check Out: Complete Dallas Cowboys NFL Preseason Schedule 2021     "", ""3 worst NFL teams in 2022 according to ESPN's computer generated power index  ESPN's NFL Football Power Index (FPI) rankings have officially been released ahead of the 2022 NFL season.

They are currently in the middle of a full rebuild, especially after moving on from superstar quarterback Deshaun Watson.     The Texans appear to be at least a few years away from being playoff contenders as they look to slowly build their roster in the Draft each year. They will take a hard look at Davis Mills this season and determine whether or not he can be their quarterback for the future.      #2 - New York Jets New York Jets quarterback Zach Wilson The New York Jets are projected to have one of the best 2022 NFL Draft classes after finding great value with their picks. They still rank towards the bottom of the FPI standings this year, but could be heading in the right direction. Woody Johnson@woodyjohnson4Draft Class 2022.

They could potentially come together to form a solid roster from the top to bottom. But they may need another year or so to add a few more pieces and mature into playoff contenders.  #1 - Chicago Bears Chicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields It may come as a bit of a surprise that the Chicago Bears are ranked last in the FPI standings. They finished the 2021 NFL season with a 6-11 record, which isn't great, but it was still better than six other teams.        The Bears lost Allen Robinson and Khalil Mack during the 2022 NFL offseason, which is part of the reason for their poor ranking. They are hoping that Justin Fields can take a big step forward this year, though they have failed to significantly upgrade the offensive weapons around him.     "", 'Deshaun Watson\'s future  The Houston Texans enter next season with a new head coach in Lovie Smith, and with the Deshaun Watson situation still uncertain. Smith was, of course, asked about Watson’s future with the team.   Smith spoke with Rich Eisen recently where he addressed the situation. Smith seems to believe Watson will be moved soon and feels confident with their current quarterback, Davis Mills.        ""You don’t give out starting positions in the spring, but I love what Davis has done. He’s our quarterback going into the season. There’s a lot of positions I’m worried about. Quarterback is not one of them.""           “I love what Davis Mills did last year,” he said. “I feel real good about Davis leading our team, we’ve just got to get better people around him."" NFL on Scoreboard Page@NFLonSPLovie Smith: Deshaun Watson situation will be resolved in time, Davis Mills is our quarterback dlvr.it/SKVDjc4:37 AM · Feb 23, 2022Lovie Smith: Deshaun Watson situation will be resolved in time, Davis Mills is our quarterback dlvr.it/SKVDjc     The rookie Mills played in 13 games last season for the Texans while starting in 11 of them. Mills went 2-11 as the starter, throwing for 2,64 yards with 16 touchdowns and just 10 interceptions, finishing the season with an 88.8 QBR. As for Deshaun Watson, Smith doesn\'t sound too confident that he\'ll be a Texan in the near future, and doesn\'t seem to have him part of their plans. “I don’t really know Deshaun that way since he wasn’t really involved last year,” Smith said. “Time takes care of a lot of things and time will take care of that situation too, with a favorable situation for Deshaun and us."" Deshaun Watson could be traded this offseason Cincinnati Bengals v Houston Texans     Deshaun Watson sat out all of last season due to his ongoing legal issues. While Watson\'s status for the 2022 season remains unclear, he was able to play all of last year, but the Texans decided to sit him.  The Texans had the chance to trade Watson last year, but for whatever reason, they decided not to. According to Athletics\' Jeff Lowe, the Texans have asked for at least five assets, including three first-round draft picks, for Watson. They have no desire to lower the price this upcoming offseason. Last offseason, there were rumors that the Miami Dolphins offered a trade for Watson, but Houston never accepted. With the asking price this high still and with Watson\'s legal issues still ongoing, it will be interesting to see if the Texans are able to move him soon. It also remains to be seen if Watson will be able to regain his former level of performance.     ', ""NFL Fantasy Football Week 11: Quarterback rankings  Week 11 of the 2022 Fantasy Football season presents similar opportunities as most weeks this year. The quarterback position allows managers to add massive point totals to their final weekly scores as they are often the highest-scoring players in Fantasy Football. It's important to capitalize on this position to optimize weekly lineups.  The best way to get the most out of the quarterback position is by analyzing direct matchups and recent performances. This will help managers decide on the best options to start each week of the Fantasy Football season.         Week 11 will present four fewer choices as four teams are currently in their bye weeks. This includes the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Miami Dolphins, and the Seattle Seahawks.               Tom Brady, Trevor Lawrence, Tua Tagovailoa, and Geno Smith will be unavailable this week as they are in their bye weeks. This will cause many Fantasy Football managers to seek replacements on their rosters. They may rely on these players as starters during most weeks but will need to strategize accordingly in Week 11.     The following rankings can help managers when sorting through available options this week before finalizing the Week 11 lineup. It's always important to have a strategy to earn consistent victories.

Players have put down enough tape to either lock in their starting place or have coaches starting to consider their backups. There are starters suffering injuries, rising stars pushing for a chance, and positive COVID-19 tests throwing gameplans into chaos.        One player's misfortune is another's opportunity and, from the aftermath, starting lineups will change. Here, we're looking at five players whose place may be up for grabs in Week 6.           5 players whose starting spot is under threat in Week 6 #1 – Dallas Goedert, Philadelphia Eagles Philadelphia Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert has shown progress in year four to the extent that veteran Zach Ertz has taken a back seat. But a positive COVID-19 test for Goedert seems set to leave the door open for Ertz to take the majority of snaps in the Thursday Night Football encounter against Super Bowl champions Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 6. Mike Garafolo@MikeGarafolo#Eagles TE Dallas Goedert, who is vaccinated, will need two negative tests before Thursday night to play vs. the #Buccaneers. Would seem unlikely. We’ll see.09:06 AM · Oct 12, 202152575#Eagles TE Dallas Goedert, who is vaccinated, will need two negative tests before Thursday night to play vs. the #Buccaneers. Would seem unlikely. We’ll see.     This could be Ertz's big opportunity to earn back a starting berth in the Eagles offense. The Buccaneers' defense has given up more passing yards than any other NFL team in 2021 and if Jalen Hurts and the Eagles are chasing the game, Ertz could be the main beneficiary, sending a timely reminder to head coach Nick Sirianni ahead of the trade deadline. #2 – Tyrod Taylor, Houston Texans Tyrod Taylor will not be starting in Week 6, but he could still be set to lose his starting place when the Houston Texans take on the Indianapolis Colts in an AFC South divisional clash. John McClain@McClain_on_NFLDavid Culley said when Tyrod Taylor is healthy he’ll start over Davis Mills. I’ll believe it when I see it.09:05 AM · Oct 13, 2021716David Culley said when Tyrod Taylor is healthy he’ll start over Davis Mills. I’ll believe it when I see it.     Third-round rookie selection Davis Mills showed up against the New England Patriots in Week 5, passing for 312 yards and three touchdowns. Mills was a last-minute field goal away from leading the Texans to an unlikely victory against head coach Bill Belichick, who has earned a reputation for bottling up first-year quarterbacks. Another performance of that caliber would leave a serious question for Texans head coach David Culley to answer ahead of Taylor's eventual return. The veteran is week-to-week with a hamstring injury. Mills had a solid starting debut against the Carolina Panthers in Week 3, completing 68% of his 28 pass attempts, before taking a step back with a four-interception game in a 40-0 blowout loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 4. Mills' 72% completion rate against the Pats earned him Offensive Rookie of the Week honors. Another good display against the Colts and the Texans may realize they have something in Davis, making it counter-productive to turn back to Taylor.     5 players whose starting place is in danger in Week 6 Here are three more players who could lose their starting spot in Week 6. #3 – Christian Kirk, Arizona Cardinals Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Christian Kirk had a nice start to the season through three games, culminating in a 104-yard display against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 3. But Kirk was targeted once for five yards in the Week 4 win against the Los Angeles Rams and hauled in five catches for only 39 yards against the San Francisco 49ers last week. Meanwhile, second-round rookie Rondale Moore has been making waves off the bench. Moore has increased his percentage of starting snaps in the last three weeks, recording a career-high 48% of starting snaps in Week 5. Last week, he recorded his most targets, catches and yards since Week 2. Mike Clay@MikeClayNFLRondale Moore matched Christian Kirk in routes for the first time yesterday. ARZ WR targets figure to increase slightly with Maxx Williams out, as well.08:14 AM · Oct 11, 2021925Rondale Moore matched Christian Kirk in routes for the first time yesterday. ARZ WR targets figure to increase slightly with Maxx Williams out, as well.     Kirk has done little wrong, but Moore is turning heads at every opportunity. It could take one big breakout game off the bench for Moore to overtake Kirk in the pecking order, and it could be when the unbeaten Cards face the Cleveland Browns in Week 6. #4 – Chuba Hubbard, Carolina Panthers Rookie running back Chuba Hubbard logged his first career 100-yard rushing game in Week 5, but the Carolina Panthers offense stalled against the Philadelphia Eagles and ended up falling to defeat. Without the safety blanket of checking down to Christian McCaffrey, quarterback Sam Darnold threw three interceptions against the Eagles as the Panthers blew a 15-6 half-time lead to lose 21-18 after a late blocked punt. Field Yates@FieldYatesPanthers head coach Matt Rhule says RB Christian McCaffrey is 50-50 to play on Sunday: “I couldn’t go either way right now.”12:44 PM · Oct 13, 2021113862Panthers head coach Matt Rhule says RB Christian McCaffrey is 50-50 to play on Sunday: “I couldn’t go either way right now.”     Hubbard proved he can play a role in head coach Matt Rhule's offense but, if McCaffrey is available, the temptation will be to slot the star runner back into the starting role. McCaffrey has a unique ability of ripping off a seven or eight-yard run for a first down when the heat is turned up – something the Panthers needed in the loss to the Eagles. #5 – Jacoby Brissett, Miami Dolphins, quarterback Jacoby Brissett held down the fort for three starts while Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was on the sidelines, but Week 5 could have been the final outing in the starting jersey for the former Colts and Patriots passer. Brissett sustained a hamstring injury during last week's loss against the Buccaneers but played through the pain barrier and finished the game. Tagovailoa has been officially designated to return ahead of the Dolphins' Week 6 game in London, England, and should be under center against the Jaguars having recovered from breaking ribs in Week 2.

Week 7 quarterback dilemmas #2 - Davis Mills, Houston Texans Week 7 could be the end of Davis Mills\' run as the starting quarterback of the Houston Texans. The rookie quarterback out of Stanford was drafted in the third round by the Texans to be more of a project. He was never really supposed to start in 2021, but between the Deshaun Watson situation and veteran Tyrod Taylor being injured, his opportunity came sooner than expected.

They haven\'t been too far behind the rest of the rookie quarterbacks for the most part. If Tyrod Taylor is healthy enough to return in Week 7, it is likely that he will get the starting quarterback job back, for now. The Houston Texans are going nowhere this year, so Davis Mills may get another opportunity at some point. #1 - Jimmy Garoppolo, San Francisco 49ers The San Francisco 49ers continue to have one of the most interesting quarterback situations in the entire NFL. If both Jimmy Garoppolo and Trey Lance are healthy in Week 7, it is still unknown which of the two will be given the start.

Unfortunately, we may see a diminished version of this Houston team as Davis Mills will start with Tyrod Taylor on injured reserve.     Houston Texans v Cleveland Browns This game should provide us with an opportunity to observe what Tim Kelly, who's making noise with the Texans' offense, can do against a ferocious pass rush. This game would be a more exciting contest if the Texans had Tyrod Taylor available after his strong start to the season. But with rookie Davis Mills starting for the first time in his NFL career and a short week, the Panthers should win this game with some comfort.     There is not a worse opponent for Mills to start his career against. He's far from ready to play, and the Panthers began their season on fire, especially with their loaded defensive line. Not only should Carolina win, but they will also cover the spread. There's still a reason to watch this game, though. Tim Kelly is becoming a hot commodity in NFL circles for doing what he's doing with this offense, which lacks talent in most groups.

The quarterback finished by completing 12 of 22 passes for 133 yards and a touchdown. He also contributed 82 yards on 11 carries to the rushing attack.  Where will Lamar Jackson sign next year? The young quarterback entered contract negotiations with the Ravens this offseason. He is a free agent after this year and both sides were interested in extending him.     That didn\'t happen as they could not meet the quarterback\'s self-imposed regular season deadline. That reality will likely have Ravens fans nervous, but the two sides maintain that they want to work a deal out.    However, if they are unable to, plenty of other teams will line up to sign the former MVP. The Carolina Panthers will need a quarterback next season. The New York Giants might as well. Even teams with quarterbacks will be interested in the Ravens quarterback\'s talent. Most teams would at least look into Jackson\'s free agency if he and the Ravens are not able to get a deal done. However, it remains very likely that he\'ll stay in Baltimore for the foreseeable future. A long-term deal with record-setting totals is probably on the way.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit the Manningcast and H/T Sportskeeda.

Jackson himself has missed practices this season due to illness and even missed the road game against the Chicago Bears. But his inconsistencies have led to turnovers and incompletions in the passing game. So far this season, through ten games, Lamar Jackson has completed just 64% of his passes.

While the Steelers\' struggles are immense right now, their defense can force turnovers, which is something that Jackson and the Ravens will have to figure out.     ', ""3 ways Lamar Jackson proved doubters wrong vs. Colts  Perhaps one of Lamar Jackson's greatest assets has always been underestimated. For years, pundits have predicted his demise. People have always gone on to say that this is the year the NFL defenses will figure out Lamar Jackson. That threat never materialized, though, and if Lamar Jackson's performance against the Indianapolis Colts is any indication, there is not much to worry about in that regard in the immediate future. Lamar Jackson confounded his doubters yet again and he did so in a variety of ways.  Ways in which Lamar Jackson responded to his critics against the Indianapolis Colts        #1 - Passing volume           One criticism that has always been thrown in Lamar Jackson's direction is apparently his over-dependence on the running game. Rushing does not pick up as many yards as passing on average, and that has led the Ravens to always face an issue in getting a large lead or clawing back a deficit. Lamar Jackson flipped that belief on its head when he threw for over 400 yards. No less than 333 yards came in the second half and overtime alone, as the Baltimore Ravens came from behind to beat the Colts. #2 - Passing accuracy Not only did Lamar Jackson pass a lot, he passed better than any quarterback has ever done. Just to be clear, that is not hyperbole. He became the first quarterback ever to complete more than 85% of his passes when throwing for more than 400 yards. NFL on CBS 🏈@NFLonCBSTonight, both Lamar Jackson and Carson Wentz joined Tom Brady as the only QBs to throw for 400+ yards with 0 INT in a game this season.9:13 AM · Oct 12, 20211375158Tonight, both Lamar Jackson and Carson Wentz joined Tom Brady as the only QBs to throw for 400+ yards with 0 INT in a game this season. https://t.co/12jupNybGb     Further, he did not throw a single interception in the game as he joined his compatriot on the other side, Carson Wentz, and the evergreen Tom Brady to become just the third player this season to throw for 400 yards in a game without interceptions. #3 - Clutch mentality While stats such as passing and rushing yards are easily quantifiable, mentality is something that is more difficult to measure. It is what sets champions apart from others. There are many players who can rack up the stats, but very few who can rack them up at the right moment.

Nobody would have expected them to win from there, but Lamar Jackson had the wherewithal to lead his team to glory.

Jackson\'s performance in college was an integral aspect of the quarterback\'s career heading forward. After an iconic three-year stint with the Cardinals, Jackson is currently using his talents to play for the Baltimore Ravens in the NFL.  LeBron James\' dynamic with Lamar Jackson LeBron James looks on at an LA Lakers game     LeBron James is widely regarded as one of the greatest athletes of all time. Given the natural athleticism paired with his discipline in taking care of his body, James continues to be an elite athlete even at 36 years old. Showing his love for football through the years with his support for the University of Ohio\'s college team as well as the Cleveland Browns, LeBron James\' love for the game is also matched by his proficiency for the game. LeBron James was widely regarded as one of the best football prospects in the state of Ohio. Back in his high school days, James represented St. Vincent-St. Mary as a two-sport athlete. Playing only two full seasons of high school football, James still ranks seventh in the school with 27 career touchdowns. Lamar Jackson was a widely reputed college athlete.

Continuing his success as a quarterback as he joined the NFL, Lamar Jackson won the unanimous MVP award in his sophomore season with the Baltimore Ravens. Jackson recently earned a comparison to LeBron James. After leading the Ravens to a win after coming back from their third double-digit deficit in the second half of the game. In a performance that saw the Baltimore Ravens overcome the Minnesota Vikings after being down by 14 points, the quarterback was compared to the LA Lakers superstar by ESPN analyst and former Dallas Cowboys Marcus Spears.

', ""NFL DFS: Lamar Jackson and other overpriced players for Week 13  The DFS main slate for Week 13 has some enticing matchups. Although only two games have a Vegas over/under of 50 points or more, several other matchups will have the potential to be a shootout. That being said, there will be some duds, and expensive duds at that. This week, we examine some of the more overpriced players that DFS managers should avoid because of their inflated price points.  Overpriced DFS players for Week 13        #1 - Lamar Jackson, QB, Baltimore Ravens ($7,800 DraftKings | $8,500 FanDuel)           Lamar Jackson’s fantasy performance this season is not as elite as we’re accustomed to. His DFS price continues to be one of the higher price points because of his rushing ability and his real-life value to the Ravens. Still, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, expect this game to be as ugly as Roethlisberger’s deep ball in 2021. He will provide a solid floor, but it does not justify his high DFS price. Stephen A Smith@stephenasmithI gotta see it to believe it with LAMAR JACKSON! I don't trust him, yet.12:34 PM · Nov 29, 202189567I gotta see it to believe it with LAMAR JACKSON! I don't trust him, yet. https://t.co/XSwQjSVbN2     #2 - Najee Harris, RB, Pittsburgh Steelers ($7,700 DraftKings | $8,000 FanDuel) Speaking of ugly, Harris will once again have all the volume, but the yards-per-carry or Pittsburgh’s game script will make you scream in agony as you're still eating Thanksgiving leftovers. At this price point, DFS players should avoid him this week. Expect the Steelers to test the Ravens through the air, and unless they involve Harris more in the passing game, he will not return value this weekend. Brooke Pryor@bepryorNajee Harris did Thanksgiving with the Tomlins, and he didn’t have to bring a dish.12:15 PM · Nov 26, 20213406208Najee Harris did Thanksgiving with the Tomlins, and he didn’t have to bring a dish. https://t.co/FQi51QSQUL     #3 - Cordarrelle Patterson, RB, Atlanta Falcons ($7,000 DraftKings | $7,400 FanDuel) People continue to doubt Patterson’s fantasy potential, and this column is a guilty party. Patterson’s value to the Falcons’ offense cannot be denied. His week 12 performance coming off an injury is impressive. Against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, however, expect their stout defensive line to bottle up Patterson. At this DFS price point, it’s too high due to the tough matchup for the Falcons. #4 - DK Metcalf, WR, Seattle Seahawks ($6,700 DraftKings | $7,300 FanDuel) DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett’s fantasy values are tied to quarterback Russell Wilson’s health and ability to get them the ball. There’s a reason that tight end Gerald Everett has garnered an increased target share since Wilson returned from injury. Wilson’s ability, or lack of, affects Metcalf’s deep ball potential. At this high price point against a red-hot San Francisco 49ers team, it’s too much of a risk to play Metcalf in DFS this week.     #5 - Tyler Lockett, WR, Seattle Seahawks ($6,500 DraftKings | $6,900 FanDuel) Lockett has better fantasy (and real life if you look at Week 12’s box score) value than Metcalf, but the price that DFS players must pay for him does not justify the risk as long as Russell Wilson does not look right. DFS players can find better value elsewhere away from the Seahawk wide receiver this week.Also Read: What is Lamar Jackson’s Contract Breakdown?     "", ""Ranking Lamar Jackson's 3 worst games in the NFL  Lamar Jackson was heavily doubted heading into the 2018 NFL Draft, yet he became one of the best quarterbacks in the league. Now he's a must-see on TV and has defenses on tenterhooks every week for the Baltimore Ravens.  But even with a league MVP under his belt, his time in the NFL hasn’t always been peachy. While he's determined to bounce back from a poor 2021-22 season, the Ravens quarterback will have his task cut out against some of the league's most sophisticated defenses.        The annual question will surely return, will this be the year that Jackson is figured out? Although it hasn’t happened often, let’s take a look back at the three worst games of his career.           #3 Pittsburgh Steelers, 2019 Baltimore Ravens vs. Pittsburgh Steelers There is absolutely no love lost between the Baltimore Ravens and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Throw away the records and pay no attention to the players that are on the field of play. Whenever these two teams get together, blood is shed and hard hits are generated.        During an early-season game against Pittsburgh in 2019, Jackson was found wanting against a top-of-the-line Steelers defense. Jackson’s inability to complete passes was evident as he finished with just 161 passing yards. The Steelers got him time after time, resulting in three interceptions. Normally so elusive, the quarterback was unable to wriggle free from the Steelers defense. He was forced to eat turf on countless occasions. Despite his struggles, he managed to lead the Ravens to a 26-23 victory.     #2 Kansas City Chiefs, 2020 Baltimore Ravens vs. Kansas City Chiefs Lamar Jackson has continually been compared to fellow MVP counterpart, Patrick Mahomes. While Jackson has been lauded for his ability to make defenders miss, his lack of accuracy from the pocket has earned him plenty of criticism. Mahomes, on the other hand, has been a marvel with the Kansas City Chiefs. After coming up short during their head-to-head showdowns on a number of occasions, Jackson was hopeful that a reprieve of sorts would come his way as the two faced off during an early-season game in 2020.        Known for their high-powered offense, the Kansas City Chiefs showed a different dynamic to their game. Defensively, they zoned in on the quarterback. Pass after pass hit the turf, falling well short of the target.  Jackson finished the game with just 97 passing yards from 15 completed passes. Mahomes, unsurprisingly, was out of this world, throwing for 385 yards and four touchdowns. The Ravens lost the game 34-20. #1 Cleveland Browns, 2021 Baltimore Ravens vs. Cleveland Browns     Over the past few years, the Cleveland Browns have emerged from the shadows in the AFC North. Once quickly dismissed and easily defeated, the Browns are no longer an easy win. With their season teetering in 2021, Cleveland attempted to right the ship against the Baltimore Ravens during a late-season showdown. By all accounts, the Browns had everything clicking on this particular day. They pushed the Ravens quarterback out of the pocket and dared him to beat them with his legs. On most occasions, employing such a game plan would work to Jackson's benefit. But this time around, he was unable to pick apart Cleveland’s defense.Forced to use his arm, he floundered around the field, throwing for just 165 passing. To make matters worse, he had a propensity to throw the ball to the wrong team. He finished the game with four interceptions, a career high. Despite his horrific play, Baltimore held on for a six-point victory.     "", ""Lamar Jackson 2021 fantasy football rankings, impact, dynasty outlook, and more  Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is one of the most exciting players in the NFL. The 2019 league MVP is only getting better and should once again be a player to watch in the upcoming campaign.

"", '“Is Lamar Jackson becoming Kawhi Leonard?” - Colin Cowherd draws comparison between NFL and NBA stars  Lamar Jackson is turning the corner on what has become a full-blown marathon effort to get every last cent he can out of the NFL.   When the quarterback rose to providence, fans of the league were also served glimpses of Kawhi Leonard\'s name from time to time. Now, speaking on ""The Herd with Colin Cowherd,"" show host and analyst Colin Cowherd floated them as being very similar stories.                   Will Lamar Jackson play every game of 2023?   Here\'s how he put it: ""Is Lamar Jackson becoming Kawhi Leonard? Think about it. Unquestionably. Top ten franchise talents. Neither trust anybody. Kawhi uses Uncle Dennis as his agent. Lamar used his mom and now an unlicensed agent. They\'ve got a trust issue..."" Cowherd continued by explaining that injuries cropped up for both players at the same time:     ""By like year four or five with Kawhi Leonard, it got odd and he got hurt and there was mystery and we never really got a straight answer. And now in year three or four for [Jackson], he\'s hurt and there\'s mystery and it\'s odd."" Lastly, he claimed that Jackson could have arrived at the perfect moment last season, but chose not to: ""We never really got a straight answer. Could he have played? I thought he was ready to play in late December. Then he never played. They\'re kind of becoming the same guy.""         Lamar Jackson stares down three-peat season performance in 2023 At this point, a number of outcomes are possible for Lamar Jackson. The Baltimore Ravens quarterback could land with another team at any moment, or he could be forced to choose between his team and retirement.  Given the fact that he is in his mid-20s, retirement is as unlikely as it gets. That leaves him with the Ravens to contend with. However, it has been a similar story for Jackson over the last two seasons. In both seasons, he played 12 games. In 2021, he threw for 16 touchdowns and 13 interceptions and in 2022, he threw for 17 touchdowns and seven interceptions.  Injuries arrived at tough moments in both years, leaving the team with a borderline Wild Card record. If he doesn\'t leave Baltimore in 2023, will he follow the same storyline for a third time? As the Ravens will likely know by now, twice is a coincidence and thrice is a pattern.     If any of the above quotes are used, please credit The Herd with Colin Cowherd and H/T Sportskeeda.     ']"
