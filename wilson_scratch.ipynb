       "' During Monday night\\'s game, Peyton Manning was left in awe of Lamar Jackson. On the Manningcast, the Hall of Fame quarterback watched the Baltimore Ravens star make a pass that left both Manning brothers stunned.  ESPN@espn\"Young QBs don\\'t watch that. That is not normal. ... Lamar Jackson is different.\" Peyton with some words of wisdom after seeing this pass by Lamar 5130547\"Young QBs don\\'t watch that. That is not normal. ... Lamar Jackson is different.\" Peyton with some words of wisdom after seeing this pass by Lamar 😅 https://t.co/VHQ0DGhrEX        Jackson didn\\'t step into his throw, nor did he throw the ball at a normal arm angle or with what looked like any amount of force. He simply flicked the ball forward with perfect accuracy to James Proche II in front of him downfield.           Baltimore Ravens v New Orleans Saints The brothers were stunned by how easy it was, and Peyton Manning warned fans watching at home: \"I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen that. I\\'ve never seen that. I couldn\\'t do that, but... young quarterbacks, don\\'t watch that. That is not normal, that is not easy to do. Get your feet set. Lamar Jackson is different. He\\'s special, he can make those kind of throws. You can\\'t.\"        The Ravens won 27-13 thanks to a stifling defense and a stellar rushing attack. The quarterback finished by completing 12 of 22 passes for 133 yards and a touchdown. He also contributed 82 yards on 11 carries to the rushing attack.  Where will Lamar Jackson sign next year? The young quarterback entered contract negotiations with the Ravens this offseason. He is a free agent after this year and both sides were interested in extending him.     That didn\\'t happen as they could not meet the quarterback\\'s self-imposed regular season deadline. That reality will likely have Ravens fans nervous, but the two sides maintain that they want to work a deal out.    However, if they are unable to, plenty of other teams will line up to sign the former MVP. The Carolina Panthers will need a quarterback next season. The New York Giants might as well. Even teams with quarterbacks will be interested in the Ravens quarterback\\'s talent. Most teams would at least look into Jackson\\'s free agency if he and the Ravens are not able to get a deal done. However, it remains very likely that he\\'ll stay in Baltimore for the foreseeable future. A long-term deal with record-setting totals is probably on the way.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit the Manningcast and H/T Sportskeeda.     '"

       "[\"How have the Jaguars fared in London? Exploring Jacksonville's performances on the international stage  The JacksonvilleJaguars will be back in London again in the 2023 season, this time for two games.  They will meet the Atlanta Falcons in Week 4 and the Buffalo Bills the following week at Tottenham Hotspur stadium. Jags owner Shad Khan is the reason why the franchise makes so many trips to Europe. Khan also owns Premier League team Fulham which is situated in the capital.        So, how have Jacksonville fared across the pond?           A mixed bag for the Jacksonville Jaguars in the UK It all started in 2013 at Wembley, as the Jags hosted the NFC champions from the previous year. It did not end well for Jacksonville as they were embarrassed losing 42-10 to the San Francisco 49ers. They were 28-3 down at halftime, as Colin Kaepernick went 10/16 for 164 yards and a TD. The Jags were cooked on the ground giving up 221 rushing yards, a third one of which was Kaepernick. Chad Henne's 46.7 QBR rating was not enough for the Jags. 0-1 in London. Yet another bad outing for the Jags in 2014 at Wembley. They were beaten 31-17 by the Dallas Cowboys. The Jags found themselves down 24-7 at the half and could only muster up consolation points. Tony Romo had an elite game, going 20/27, for 245 yards and 3TDs. This game was never close, as the Blake Bortles era began in Duval. 0-2 in London     Finally, it happened. The Jags fans from across the world could go home happy with a 34-31 win in 2015. E.J. Manuel and the Buffalo Bills were not the toughest opponent as Bortles slightly outplayed him to guide the Jags to a late win. Young receiver Allen Robinson had a big day with 6 catches for 98 yards and one TD. 1-2 in London. The Jags would for the first time play a divisional game in London, and they would be victorious. Blake Bortles' 19/33 pass attempts for 207 yards and 2TDs was enough to outduel Andrew Luck and the Indianapolis Colts. The Jags gave up 21 points in the fourth quarter to make things nervy, but they survived the scare in the end. 2-2 in London. Hard to believe but the Jaguars had now managed three straight wins overseas. This was by far the most comfortable so far. They had scored 23 at the half and continued their hot hand, getting 21 points in the second half. Joe Flacco would be benched at one point as the Baltimore Ravens surrendered. Blake Bortles had one of the best games of his life finishing with 244 yards and 4TDS. 3-2 in London.     All good things must come to an end and so the win streak in London was no more. Carson Wentz was too much for the Jaguars defense. The Eagles ran the ball 28 times for 133 yards at 4.8 yards per carry. A record crowd at Wembley to date for the NFL international series sent Jaguars fans home unhappy. 3-3 in London. Jacksonville could not stop running back Carlos Hyde in their second divisional outing in London, which came in 2019. Hyde had 160 yards on 19 carries. Gardiner Minshew was never able to get going as he threw 47 passes with only three points to show. To add more misery, Minshew was sacked four times in the 26-3 loss to the Houston Texans. 3-4 In London. No one could have foreseen what was going to happen to the world in 2020, obviously, covid prevented the Jags from making the trip to London. They would return in October 2021 and go home happy.     Trevor Lawrence won his first game abroad in his rookie season. It wasn't such an easy day for Miami Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa. This was the first time an NFL game had been at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium. 4-4 in London. And now to the most recent Jaguars trip to London. You had to have a serious off day to lose to the 2022 Denver Broncos, but that's what happened at Wembley. Russell Wilson had his average 2022 game throwing a TD and a pick, but Lawrence was bad that afternoon with a 10 QBR. Travis Etienne's 156 yards on the ground were not enough for the Jaguars. 4-5 in London.     \",\n",
       " \"Best Quarterback Rooms in NFL - 2018 Edition  The quarterback position is arguably the most important position in the NFL, while the backup quarterback position is the second most important position. The spot has not been in a better situation than 2018 in a long time. The quarterback climate has a perfect mix of veterans and new blood.  The ranking for the quarterback room has taken into account the starter, backup quarterback, scout team QB, supporting cast, offensive system and teams' expected run-to-pass ratio along with past performance and history of injury.        The article ranks the teams by scoring each quarterback and taking the cumulative score as a marker. The third quarterback is only taken into account if they are a viable trade bait or hold any chance to start during the regular season.           #32 Jacksonville Jaguars Starter - Blake Bortles, Backup - Cody Kessler Blake Bortles will try to not let his defense down It is one of the very few quarterback-proof rosters in the NFL. The team will look to lean on the run game in the offense this season. Blake Bortles has to improve his mechanics to move out the bottom of the list and Kessler will need to shake off his winless season with the Browns.     #31 Carolina Panthers Starter - Cam Newton, Backup - Taylor Heinicke Newton will have to become the Superman from 2015 Cam has to be the Superman again under new ownership. Panthers have Taylor Heinicke as their backup. If you are thinking who that person is, you are not alone. #30 Kansas City Chiefs Starter - Pat Mahomes, Backup - Chad Henne Mahomes will have to be the present and future of the squad     Pat Mahomes has not started a relevant game in the NFL. He has potential but Texas Tech's air raid offense is not the best to go by. Chad Henne couldn't beat out Blake Bortles at his worst, which is not the best news for Chiefs faithful. #29 Miami Dolphins Starter - Ryan Tannehill, Backup - Brock Osweiler Tannehill will be playing for his job Brock Osweiler can't be described as the best backup policy for Tannehill, who is coming back from a knee injury last season. The coaching staff is in the hot seat and sharing the division with Patriots does not help.     #28 Washington Redskins Starter - Alex Smith, Backup - Colt McCoy Alex Smith will have to bring his MVP season from Kansas City Alex Smith might live up to his MVPesque season from last time but McCoy would live on as a below average backup QB forever. Alex Smith ain't the worst option after Kirk Cousins left. #27 Houston Texans Starter - Deshaun Watson. Backup - Brandon Weeden Deshaun Watson will have to be the player he was before the injury     Houston has Weeden as their backup to their sophomore superstar coming off an ACL injury, O'Brien would hope for a better option than that. The team hopes to stay fit next season and do some damage in AFC. #26 Dallas Cowboys Starter - Dak Prescott, Backup - Mike White, Cooper Rush Prescott will get his sidekick in Ezekial Elliott back for the season Dak and Zeke form a formidable offense but the Cowboys quarterback room could do better than Mike White and Rush. Jason Garrett must be hoping for Kellen Moore (probably not).     #25 Cincinnati Bengals Starter - Andy Dalton, Backup - Matt Barkley Dalton will have to bemoreconsistent upcoming season Cincinnati Bengals have changes looming in front of them, the coaching staff is in the hot seat and the QB room ain't helping. Andy Dalton has been used to define the term 'average' all over the NFL dictionary and Barkley never lived up to his high school potential. #24 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Starter - Winston, Backup - Ryan Fitzpatrick Tampa Bay will not have Winston for the first 3 weeks per suspension     Winston will serve his ban and Ryan Fitzpatrick will be QB-1 in the depth chart, sounds depressing, probably is. #23 Baltimore Ravens Starter/ Backup - Joe Flacco, Lamar Jackson. The QB competition is in full swing at Ravens camp Ravens' coaching has been immensely impressed with rookie Lamar Jackson. The reports from preseason indicate that Joe Flacco has been showing more initiation as well. Ravens will be looking to capitalize on a soft AFC. #22 Chicago Bears Starter - Mitchell Trubisky, Backup - Chase Daniels Trubisky can lead Bears to playoffs and become the greatest franchise QB     Bears have a new offensive system and Chase Daniel as the backup, who has come from the Chiefs system that Matt Nagy will be running. Trubisky needs to live up to his draft pedigree and Bears can easily jump to the next tier. #21 Buffalo Bills Starter - AJ McCarron, Backup - Josh Allen, Nathan Peterman The team will hope for Josh Allen to win the starting job Bills brought in McCarron from Bengals as an insurance policy to their Rookie, Josh Allen. Bills have an average starter, one raw rookie, and a backup with starting capabilities in Peterman. No one should be surprised if everyone gets a start in Buffalo.     #20 Denver Broncos Starter - Case Keenum, Backup - Paxton Lynch, Chad Kelly Keenum will hop to fill the big shoes of Peyton Manning Case Keenum had a career year last season but he won't have the similar support cast as Minnesota. Paxton Lynch has bust written all over him and won't even command a conditional pick in return. #19 Tennessee Titans Starter - Marcus Mariota, Backup - Blaine Gabbert Mariota needs to bounce back from a dreadful last season     Titans have been a run first team but Mariota needs to improve his play for them to compete against Houston in the division. Gabbert can be a great backup in the correct system with his cannon arm and great mobility. #18 New York Giants Starter - Eli Manning, Backup - Davis Webb/ Kyle Lauletta Eli Manning will have to deliver with the run game to support Eli Manning has lost way too many steps to be a top tier QB but his stellar offensive sidekicks should take him to the belief land. Davis Webb has been making a lot of noise this offseason along with Kyle Lauletta at the backup position.     #17 Oakland Raiders Starter - Derek Carr, Backup - Connor Cooks Derek Carr will have to gel into Gruden's offense sooner than later Derek Carr underachieved last season. Cook and Carr will soon realize that life under Gruden is not as rosy as Gruden Camp. The team has Jeff Fisher vibes of finishing 8-8. #16 Detroit Lions Starter - Matthew Stafford, Backup - Matt Cassel Stafford can rise up to the next level     Stafford has one of the best arm seen in the sport but he needs a better support cast. How does Matt Cassel still have a job in NFL, even though it is as a backup? #15 Atlanta Falcons Starter - Matt Ryan, Backup - Matt Schaub Matt Ryan can bring the Falcons to the top Matt Ryan has had a legendary career till now, without winning the big one. The bad news is that they have Matt Schaub as the backup. #14 New Orleans Saints Starter - Drew Brees, Backup - Tom Savage     Drew Brees will look to take Saints further than last time Saints are moving on to a more run-heavy offense which might help the longevity of Brees. Saints are one of the big boys of NFC and Brees would love to make one last run before father time gets him. Tom Savage is not what you dream of as a backup but Saints don't have an option. Hill is the scout team QB who is turning heads at camp. #13 Seattle Seahawks Starter - Russell Wilson, Backup - Austin Davis     Russell Wilson will look for some help from the run offense Russell Wilson is a one-man offense for Seahawks with zero run game, no O-line help and below par receiving core. Russell Wilson does it all but sadly Austin Davis can't. The diminishing quality of Seahawks defense makes their chances of playoff dim. #12 Los Angeles Rams LA Rams - Starter - Jared Goff, Backup - Sean Mannion Goff will look to improve on his stellar performance last season     Jared Goff took a big leap last season. Sean McVay has been a godsend to Rams offense. Sean Mannion is not the best backup option but he has been in the system and a good subordinate to the young future of Los Angeles. Goff is a sneaky MVP candidate with Gurley by the sides. #11 Pittsburgh Steelers Starter - Roethlisberger, Backup - Mason Rudolph/ Landry Jones Roethlisberger will look to capitalize on Bell's last year in Pittsburgh Steelers have a complete offense led by Big Ben. His two quarterback understudies are raw and with minimal arm talent. Roethlisberger has been injured in bits and pieces over the last few seasons and the weak backup situation doesn't help the Steelers.     #10 Los Angeles Chargers Starter - Rivers, Backup - Geno Smith/ Cardale Jones Rivers will be looking for some luck and support from the fans Rivers is a great starter with a competent backup in Geno Smith. The run game led by Melvin Gordon with the receiving talent of Keenan Allen would be a handful for any defense. If the team stays fit, they can be a challenger for the AFC title. #09 San Francisco 49ers Starter - Jimmy Garoppolo, Backup - CJ Bethard Jimmy G will look to become Jimmy GQ     Garoppolo ended the 49ers season last year with 5 wins. The only way for the 49ers is up. Kyle Shanahan has one of the most sophisticated offenses in the league. CJ Bethard as the backup is a little suspect. Bay area is waiting for Jimmy G to become Jimmy Jesus. #8 Cleveland Browns Starter - Tyrod Taylor, Backup - Baker Mayfield/ Drew Stanton Baker and Tyrod will look to bring back the glory at Cleveland Browns were the worst team in Football but they have added to every position on the pitch. Taylor is a dependable QB, who can give you 5 wins on his worst day. Baker is the future with great football ethics and Drew Stanton will be a great third QB while developing a rookie. Browns look like a sneaky break out team for the upcoming season.     #07 Green Bay Packers Starter - Aaron Rodgers, Backup - DeShone Kizer Rodgers will be without his favorite wide receiver next season Rodgers has been known to hide most of the blemishes of his team. Packers traded for Kizer to be the backup, who was the QB of a 16 loss team. The addition of Jimmy Graham at tight end position will come as a great help after Nelson left. #06 New England Patriots Starter - Tom Brady, Backup - Brian Hoyer/ Danny Etling Brady will look to defy father time for one more season     Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time. Brian Hoyer is definitely not the greatest backup quarterback of all time. Brady's age is a sign of trouble but he is the reigning MVP of the league. Patriots have drafted Danny Etling in the late rounds who could turn up to be a great option for the future. #05 Indianapolis Colts Starter - Andrew Luck, Backup - Jacoby Brissett Luck finally looks set to be back alongside promising backup in Brissett If Andrew Luck wasn't coming back from injury, Colts could have been the top team in this exercise. Brissett has been a great trade by Colts. Luck has started training again and the revamped offensive line won't hurt either. The future looks bright for the franchise.     #04 New York Jets Starter/ Backup - Darnold, Josh McCown, Bridgewater Jets will have one of the most balanced quarterback room No one expected Jets to end up this high on the list but they have a great experienced starter and teacher in Josh McCown. They arguably got the best quarterback from the recent draft in Sam Darnold and they signed Teddy Bridgewater for free in the offseason. Bridgewater is the biggest trade asset in the league and front-runner for the comeback player of the year. Jets have stability at the position for the first time in a long time.     #03 Minnesota Vikings Starter - Kirk Cousins, Backup - Trevor Siemian Cousins will be expected to live up to his price tag The future looks bright for the franchise. Kirk Cousins is underrated even after being the costliest player in football and Siemian is as good a backup as any. Vikings will try to make the run in a loaded NFC. #02 Arizona Cardinals Starter - Sam Bradford, Backup - Josh Rosen/ Mike Glennon Rosen will look to earn the starts while Bradford needs to stay fit     The Cardinals have one of the most polished QB coming out of College in Rosen. Sam Bradford can be a top 15 quarterback when fit. The quarterback room compliments each other, unlike any other team. Cardinals can shock a lot of people next season. #01 Philadelphia Eagles Starter - Carson Wentz, Backup - Nick Foles Eagles would love another Philly special, with Wentz this time Nick Foles just won Philly the Superbowl, while the future MVP of the league (Wentz) was sidelined with an injury. Eagles have things sorted till Foles gets traded for too many draft picks. The Eagles QB room might just help them reach the mountaintop again. The in-depth look into every quarterback room made me realize that Matt Cassel, Matt Schaub, and Landry Jones will keep having backup jobs in 2096 and no one will ever notice. In conclusion. my biggest fear is that Blake Bortles will end up winning the Superbowl and make this article as irrelevant as his throwing motion.

       " '5 NFL QBs who went from starters to jobless due to one horrible season  Josh Rosen  The 2018 NFL season was one to forget in the desert as Josh Rosen\\'s rookie campaign fell off the rails with the Cardinals. It may have arguably never been on the rails to begin with now that it\\'s been given some thought.        Dan Lust 🎙@SportsLawLustJosh Rosen caught a stray in the Amended Complaint filed by Steve Wilks against the Cardinals.He says he urged the GM to trade up to draft Josh Allen in 2018 but instead the team moved up to take Josh Rosen.The complaint calls this “one of the great draft gaffes of all time.”5012Josh Rosen caught a stray in the Amended Complaint filed by Steve Wilks against the Cardinals.He says he urged the GM to trade up to draft Josh Allen in 2018 but instead the team moved up to take Josh Rosen.The complaint calls this “one of the great draft gaffes of all time.” https://t.co/zvYs8hifMs           Rosen had three more interceptions than he did touchdowns and failed to eclipse 250 passing yards in his first four NFL appearances, doing so in just one game the entire season. Some of his QB stats were brutal relative to the competition, per 98.7 FM Arizona\\'s Sports Station: \"Rosen ranked 33rd and last among qualified candidates with a quarterback rating of 66.7 this season. That ranked immediately behind rookie Bills QB Josh Allen’s 67.9 and rookie Jets signal-caller Sam Darnold’s 77.6 rating. Rosen was also 33rd by averaging 163 passing yards per game and just 5.80 yards per attempt.\"     The leash in Arizona was so short that he was yanked from the position and was on a different NFL roster by year two. Miami took him on as Ryan Fitzpatrick\\'s backup, and he couldn\\'t play his way out of that role. No team took him on during the pandemic-stricken 2020 season. He was hardly given a chance with the Atlanta Falcons, though his 2/11 passing performance probably had a lot to do with that. Blake Bortles was at the top of the world in 2018 Blake Bortles It\\'s somewhat tragic tracking the trajectory of Blake Bortles\\' NFL career, thus far. The Florida-born quarterback played college ball at UCF. He was drafted with the 2014 NFL Draft\\'s No. 3 pick to be the franchise signal-caller in Jacksonville. His rookie season was disappointing enough to put him on the chopping block. Somehow, he persevered and threw for 35 touchdowns in what was the antithesis of a sophomore slump.

Marcus Mariota 19.9 Things peaked in January 2018 when Bortles\\' Jaguars went toe-to-toe with Tom Brady\\'s Patriots, but the New England 24-20 win was the closest Bortles would get to being at the top of the NFL totem pole. His offensive line was shaky. His receivers weren\\'t putting themselves in position to make plays, and ultimately Bortles himself no longer had the stuff to be the starter for any team, at least, according to the league. Mark Sanchez had a rough season in 2012, got injured, and never returned to a starting role     Mark Sanchez Mark Sanchez can definitely up the tragedy from Blake Bortles\\' case. Sanchez came from USC as a top prospect and immediately had the Jets in the AFC Championship his first and second seasons after years of futility from the franchise, with Chad Pennington as the primary option under center. Then, Tim Tebow was brought into the mix. The \"butt fumble\" transpired at MetLife Stadium on Thanksgiving night 2012 just weeks after Hurricane Sandy. Sanchez was injured playing in a preseason game in the summer of 2013, while trying to earn the starting job. Sanchez\\'s prospects of being a top option in someone\\'s backfield were gone.        Then-Jets coach Rex Ryan spoke of his regret at even having the former first-round NFL Draft pick in the game late during a preseason game. He said that he would have changed things if he could: “That was a tough situation obviously. If I could go back and change things, of course you would. You don’t want anybody to ever get hurt. But again, you’ve got to decide, guys. Somebody has to play.” When it happened, Ryan was far less remorseful. He suggested that Sanchez being on the field was necessary. This would enable the team to decide who the starting QB would be for the 2013 season between Sanchez and Geno Smith: \"We\\'re there to win. We had our starting offense out there for three quarters -- we\\'re trying to win the game, that\\'s what we wanted to do. … We\\'re trying to compete. Everybody\\'s out there and injuries are part of the game.\"     No matter how Sanchez lost his 2013 season, it was clear he was no longer the guy in New York with second-round rookie Smith out to become QB1. He would never start again in his NFL career. Geno Smith was another Jets flameout Geno Smith Unfortunately, speaking of Geno Smith, he was a fellow Jets flameout in 2014. He joined the man he replaced and was neck and neck with during Gang Green\\'s 2013 QB competition, Mark Sanchez. He had identical touchdowns to interceptions, but Smith\\'s 2014 season hit an embarrassingly low-point in December of that year with the Jets limiting him to eight pass attempts for the first 58 minutes. When New York needed him to successfully run the two-minute drill, he threw an interception with 34 seconds left to close the door on a 16-13 loss.     Smith is, somehow, in the running for Seattle\\'s starting job here in 2022, with the Seahawks competition coming down to the 31-year-old and one of the pieces in the Russell Wilson trade, Drew Lock. By no means is he a clear-cut NFL starter, and he hasn\\'t been one in eight years. Colin Kaepernick is no longer be a starter for many reasons Colin Kaepernick This inclusion may be controversial, but Colin Kaepernick did not engineer a winning effort in San Francisco during his final seasons in the Bay in 2015 and 2016.        The 49ers made a business decision that had on-field ramifications during the winter of 2017 in cutting him. Jimmy Garoppolo, future Super Bowl QB, entered the room with long-time utility option C. J. Beathard.The fact that few teams have looked at him since then is probably primarily due to off-field distractions, but Kaepernick was never NFL starter material after showing the inability to hit his targets during a difficult 2016 campaign.

       " \"NFL Training Camp 2021: 5 Green Bay Packers players on the roster bubble\\xa0  Reigning NFC North champions Green Bay Packers have high hopes entering the 2021 NFL season. They've made back-to-back NFC Championship games over the past two seasons and will be looking at another Super Bowl appearance in 2022.  Spots on the Packers roster will be hotly contested during this year’s training camp with some of last season’s contributors likely to miss out.                   Packers players who need big training camp performances           View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Green Bay Packers (@packers)  #1 - Josh Jackson The 25-year-old cornerback has not lived up to his potential since he was drafted 45th overall by the Green Bay Packers in the 2018 NFL Draft. He recorded just 21 tackles last season, doing so in limited game time. Green Bay drafted another cornerback, Eric Stokes, in the first round of this year’s draft, which means Jackson’s time in Green Bay may be nearly up. The Packers could look for a late-round draft pick for the young cornerback.      #2 - Malik Taylor Wide receiver Malik Taylor needs a big training camp to solidify his spot on the Packers active roster. The six-foot-one, 220-pound Taylor has yet to make his mark at Lambeau Field, starting just one game last season. The 25-year-old backup wideout had only five receptions for 66 yards in 2020 in limited game time. The arrival of rookie slot receiver Amari Rodgers puts even more pressure on Taylor to stand out at training camp.  #3 - Jace Sternberger Backup tight end Jace Sternberger could be on his way out of Lambeau Field this year. On June 10, he was suspended for two games after violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy. The suspension, added to a lack of production when he was given the opportunity, sees him on the Packers roster bubble. Over his two seasons with Green Bay, he has played in 13 games with 114 yards receiving and one touchdown.  #4 - Dexter Williams     Running back Dexter Williams has seen very little game time since being drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the sixth round of the 2019 NFL Draft. He only carried the ball twice last season for the Packers for eight total yards. Green Bay drafted another running back, Kylin Hill, this year and Williams will be under immense pressure to hold onto his active roster spot.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Green Bay Packers (@packers)  #5 - Blake Bortles If star quarterback Aaron Rodgers decides to end his holdout and return to Lambeau for this year’s training camp, Blake Bortles could be cut or traded. The veteran NFL quarterback was signed by the Packers this off-season before mini-camp.     Green Bay has also signed backup quarterback Kurt Benkert, and it seems unlikely that Blake Bortles will be needed if Rodgers returns. The Packers could look to trade the 29-year-old QB to a team like the New York Jets, who are short of a veteran play-caller.The former Jacksonville Jaguars starting QB led the franchise to the NFL playoffs in 2017.     \",\n",
       " \"Dallas Cowboys training camp round-up: Cowboys realize squad depth conundrum after injury scare  The Dallas Cowboys entered 2021 NFL training camp with high hopes, with the return of the franchise quarterback, a stellar wide receiving core and a promising rookie linebacker who could be the face of the defense.  But just days into training camp practice, the Cowboys have had some injury scares that have made them think twice about the depth chart.        Dallas Cowboys training camp roundup: Depth chart necessities           The Dallas Cowboys were delighted with the recovery and return of starting quarterback Dak Prescott from a serious ankle injury. Just days into 2021 training camp, the franchise quarterback suffered a shoulder injury that will keep him out of action for a short period of time. With that, the Cowboys were dealt with a lingering question from last season as to who the best backup quarterback option is. Cowboys RB Ezekiel Elliott on Dak Prescott shoulder injury: “I know it sucks for him having to be sidelined again.” But relieved it’s just a strain. pic.twitter.com/2Bxl9X46pc— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) July 29, 2021     Although it turned out that Prescott's injury is just a fatigue-related issue, it did cause some panic as to what the team would do if he were out for a significant period of time again. The Cowboys turned to Garrett Gilbert to work with first-team reps, but his performance seemed to concern the Cowboys coaching staff. Now, it seems the team is looking for a veteran free agent quarterback, someone who can be relied upon, if need be. One option could be Blake Bortles, who was recently released by the Green Bay Packers after Aaron Rodgers officially returned to the team. While wide receiver is in another position with some injuries, the Cowboys seem to have plenty of depth to cover until the return of Amari Cooper and Michael Gallup. The offensive line position does have some depth issues. Tyron Smith and La'el Collins look to be locked in, but Ty Nsekhe and Terence Steele haven't impressed at offensive tackle.     COWBOYS TRAINING CAMP 🎬: WR CeeDee Lamb goes airborne! ✭ #dallascowboys pic.twitter.com/9UwaMqLoJ9— The Cowboys Network (@TheCowboysNet) July 28, 2021 On the interior offensive line, Zack Martin hasn't been a participant in practice, which isn't a concern at the moment. Luckily, Connor Williams is versatile and Connor McGovern is slowly making improvements as well, but the Cowboys may still want to add some depth to the offensive line to ensure squad depth in case of unforeseen circumstances.With the addition of Malik Hooker, the Dallas Cowboys defense seems to be off to a good start with new defensive coordinator Dan Quinn. There is some depth on defense, which should prove valuable down the stretch.     \",\n",
       " \"Predicting the top three candidates for NFL Comeback Player of the Year in 2022  The NFL can be a very unforgiving environment at times. Players are always just one bad tackle or landing from retirement. The careers of some of the greatest prospects can be derailed, with the player returning to the NFL diminished. The majority of players suffer at least one gruesome injury during their careers, but they always try their best to return to the league.  The NFL Comeback Player of the Year award is awarded to players who missed significant time in a campaign, only to return in earnest. The award is about overcoming adversity and is not always about returning from injury. Sometimes a player is benched and has to break out and prove himself.        Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals won the award for the 2021 NFL season. The Bengals quarterback tore his ACL in a tackle in his rookie year during the 2020 campaign. There were concerns he would be the same player upon his return. These concerns proved unfounded. Burrow threw for 4,611 yards and 34 touchdowns in the 2021 NFL season. His performances led the Bengals to the Super Bowl, where they fell to the Los Angeles Rams.           Here are my top three candidates to take home Comeback Player of the Year honors in the upcoming season: #1. Christian McCaffrey, Carolina Panthers Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey     Call me an eternal optimist, but I will or have drafted Christian McCaffrey anywhere from the second pick of my NFL fantasy drafts onwards. Mainly because he has been a historically great statistical performer and a really fun player to watch when healthy. McCaffrey has been limited to just ten games over the last two years by shoulder, thigh, hamstring and ankle injuries. This is obviously assuming that he can finally stay healthy in 2022. The Riot Report@RRiotReportYou can't ever get tired of watching Christian McCaffrey highlights.The dual-threat RB turns 26 today and #Panthers fans can't wait to see him back on the field.:@NFL41756You can't ever get tired of watching Christian McCaffrey highlights.The dual-threat RB turns 26 today and #Panthers fans can't wait to see him back on the field.🎥:@NFLhttps://t.co/uGKbVIaZJv Looking at the pieces around him, unless you count like the last one-and-a-half years of banged-up Cam Newton, Baker Mayfield may be the best quarterback McCaffrey has played with. You may not be a fan of Ben McAdoo as a head coach, but looking at how the New York Giants have fallen apart since his departure and considering how quick-paced his offenses are, the scheme could create more space for the back. Especially with a talented group of receivers around him.     Most importantly, I don’t believe people acknowledge how much better the Carolina Panthers O-line could be. I expect them to improve at three spots, with sixth overall pick Ikem Ekwonu and a couple of solid veterans. When he last played a full season (2019), McCaffrey led the league with 2,400 scrimmage yards and 19 TDs. #2. Allen Robinson, Los Angeles Rams Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Allen Robinson A different comeback story may be written for Allen Robinson in the City of Angels. This guy has basically been in quarterback purgatory ever since he came to Penn State. Blake Bortles probably remains the best guy he’s caught passes from ever since then, before kind of shutting it down since December last year. Robinson was still able to produce despite that.     Bleacher Nation Bears@BN_BearsMy gift to you on Allen Robinson’s birthday: 2 minutes of highlights featuring some of the best hands in football. 🥳   1899My gift to you on Allen Robinson’s birthday: 2 minutes of highlights featuring some of the best hands in football. 🥳 🎁 🎉 https://t.co/Hg0V3GXukw If you take out his first and most recent year in the pros respectively (along with 2017, when he was lost for the year after just one catch), he has averaged 1,087 yards and 7.4 touchdowns per season. Whether he was used on the perimeter as a vertical, ball-winning receiver or running option routes from the slot, Robinson can and has done pretty much everything. He now gets to play under Sean McVay and the Los Angeles Rams. In the upcoming NFL campaign, he has Matthew Stafford throwing him the ball. Stafford has only failed to go over 4,000 passing yards once since 2011 (when he was limited to just eight games). Looking at how they used Odell Beckham Jr. as their X receiver last season, particularly as a designated red-zone target near the goal-line, but also to some degree Robert Woods, I could easily see him go for 1,200 yards and double-digit touchdowns.     Also Checkout:- NFL Most Valuable Teams #3. Saquon Barkley, New York Giants New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley Finally, the optimist in me also had to put up Saquon Barkley here. He headlined my list last season and barely made an impact at all, due to constantly being banged up yet again. So once more, I’m working under the assumption that he won’t land badly, twisting his ankle or knee, which has caused him to miss more games than he's played across the past two seasons.     I believe because he has tried to tough it out and hasn’t looked like himself, people think he’s washed. I refuse to not look at him as an elite draft prospect and talent in the running back position. His combination of burst, lower body strength, natural receiving skills and his break-away speed made him the NFL’s leader in scrimmage yards as a rookie back in 2018. Athlete Swag@AthleteSwagSaquon Barkley’s highlights set to the Space Jam soundtrack is perfect773238Saquon Barkley’s highlights set to the Space Jam soundtrack is perfect https://t.co/uRuQpR8K84 The following season I’d argue the Giants had the worst O-line in the league and then of course the injuries started to hit. Considering Big Blue now have two tackles from top-ten picks and added a couple of above-average starting veterans on the interior, that unit has seen an immense upgrade.     Then you have Brian Daboll and Mike Kafka opening up what has been a very underwhelming offensive structure. Combine this with the more dynamic receiving talent around him and Saquon Barkley will remind people of the player he is in this NFL season.If you enjoyed this breakdown, please make sure to check out the original piece, where I also predict all the other awards and the playoff picture, leading up to Super Bowl LVII.     \",\n",
       " \"Ranking Tom Brady's 10 greatest games in the NFL playoffs  Name a better pairing than Tom Brady and the NFL playoffs. Brady-Bill Belichick perhaps comes closest, but you get the point.  Tom Brady is the definition of a perennial contender. Over the years, the league's most garlanded QB has put together some truly special performances in the NFL playoffs. Here are ten of the heroic quarterback's most iconic performances in the NFL playoffs.        Tom Brady's greatest playoff outings            #1 - Super Bowl 51 versus the Atlanta Falcons (2016) This was one of the best late-game performances by any player in the history of the sport. Early on, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots came out flat and fell behind Matt Ryan and Kyle Shanahan's passing attack. Near the end of the third quarter, the scoreboard read 28-3. It seemed the New England Patriots were going to lose the Super Bowl. That's when Atlanta hit a wall and Tom Brady started to heat up. Within the final quarter and change, Brady made up a 25-point deficit and forced the game into overtime. By this point, the Atlanta Falcons never had a chance. It was the largest comeback in Super Bowl history. Most New England Patriots fans would rank this as the best game they have ever seen. This might have been Tom Brady's greatest moment as an NFL quarterback.     #2 - 2018 AFC Championship against the Kansas City Chiefs (2018) This was Patrick Mahomes' breakout season, which made Brady's showing all the more audacious. Mahomes spent the length of the regular season lighting up the league, throwing for 50 touchdowns. It seemed that the Chiefs were a shoe-in for the Super Bowl. However, they needed to get past Tom Brady first. what a time. ⏰ #Madden22 pic.twitter.com/BpupuKB4e3— Patrick Mahomes II (@PatrickMahomes) June 17, 2021 The Kansas City Chiefs had already played the New England Patriots earlier in the year. Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady went back and forth en route to a 40-43 loss for Kansas. With the game running so close, it appeared Patrick Mahomes was too good to lose a similar game twice.     However, Tom Brady's Patriots put up 37 in the AFC Championship game to send the young gun home. The game ended up going into overtime due to a late score by Brady with only about a minute left to play. #3 - AFC Championship versus Jacksonville Jaguars (2017) The Jacksonville Jaguars were balling in 2017. Leonard Fournette had a breakout rookie year, earning over 1,000 rushing yards and nine touchdowns. Their defense was ranked second overall. Going into this meeting, though, Tom Brady was the favorite. Tom Brady     However, the legendary quarterback came out flat. Late in the game, it seemed that the New England Patriots were going to go home. Brady chose this moment to put up one of the most clutch fourth-quarters of his career. At the end of the game, the New England Patriots came out on top and Blake Bortles was sent home. #4 - AFC Championship versus the Denver Broncos (2015) The Denver Broncos had one of the best defenses of all time in 2015. The team featured Von Miller, DeMarcus Ware, Aqib Talib, Chris Harris Jr., TJ Ward, and others. The defense was nigh unbeatable. While Tom Brady ultimately lost the game, he still got within one throw of forcing overtime. Down 20-12, Tom Brady had one drive to tie the game. He scored a touchdown but could not convert on the two-point attempt. Had kicker Stephen Gostkowski not missed a kick earlier in the game, the Patriots would have been able to tie it with an extra point. Instead, they were forced to go for two at the end of a late scoring drive.         What was impressive about this was just how good the Denver Broncos defense was. Every other team failed to accomplish what Tom Brady did that season. #5 - Super Bowl 52 versus Philadelphia Eagles (2017) The Philadelphia Eagles were on fire during the 2017 regular season. But when Carson Wentz went down with an injury, few had the Philadelphia Eagles as contenders for the Super Bowl. That is, everyone except for the Philadelphia Eagles. They coasted to a top seed and used their home-field advantage to deliver knockout blows to the Atlanta Falcons and the Minnesota Vikings.     People continued to doubt the Philadelphia Eagles up to the last second of the Super Bowl. That was the momentum the Eagles carried into the meeting with Tom Brady's Patriots. Nick Foles played the best game of his life, forcing Tom Brady to reciprocate. While Tom Brady ultimately lost the game, it was not because of a lack of trying. Brady threw for over 500 yards and three touchdowns, blowing up the stat sheet. The offensive performance was something unheard of in the Super Bowl, especially in a losing effort. Tom Brady     The game came down to a Hail Mary thrown by Tom Brady that was almost caught for a go-ahead touchdown.  #6 - Super Bowl 38 versus Philadelphia Eagles Tom Brady won his third Super Bowl in this game. He finished the day with 236 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions, according to Pro Football Reference. The Patriots won the game 24-21. #7 - Super Bowl 36 versus St. Louis Rams The game resulted in Tom Brady's first Super Bowl victory. He threw for 145 yards and one touchdown. While the stats aren't very Brady-like, it was his first Super Bowl. #8 - Super Bowl 49 versus Seattle Seahawks Tom Brady set up the New England Patriots to win this game. He had a 74 percent completion percentage and threw for four touchdowns. Everyone remembers this game for the interception at the goal line by Malcolm Butler which meant Tom Brady's heroic effort went a tad unnoticed. #9 - Super Bowl 53 versus Los Angeles Rams     Wade Phillips had Tom Brady's number in this game. Even so, he was able to find Rob Gronkowski to set up the only touchdown of the game. His ability to overcome Wade Phillips overshadowed his stats on the night. He had 262 yards and an interception. #10 - Super Bowl 55 versus Kansas City ChiefsWhile Tom Brady did not have too much to do in this game, he did become the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, and only the second quarterback to do it with two teams. He completed 72 percent of his passes and threw for 201 yards and three touchdowns en route to a 31-9 win.     \",\n",
       " \"Ranking Patrick Mahomes' 3 worst games of his career  Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is of course one of the best players in the NFL. He has won a Super Bowl, an MVP award, and has been named to the Pro Bowl every year he’s started in the league. He’s also got one of the best records in the league, winning 50 games in just 63 starts.  He has a resumé to match anyone’s and he’s thrown 151 touchdowns and 18,991 yards in just four years as a starter. In 2018 he won his MVP award and threw 50 touchdowns, a feat only matched by legends Tom Brady and Peyton Manning.        Bleacher Report@BleacherReport50. Yes FIFTY. 23-year-old Patrick Mahomes just threw his 50th touchdown this season.18539353650. Yes FIFTY. 23-year-old Patrick Mahomes just threw his 50th touchdown this season. https://t.co/Vr6iIdiz07           However, he hasn’t always had it his own way. Even though he plays well most Sundays, there have been times he’s had a horror show. Here are Patrick Mahomes' three worst NFL games: #3 - vs Jacksonville Jaguars, 2018 Jacksonville Jaguars v Kansas City Chiefs     Mahomes didn't have his best game during his first year as a starter when the Chiefs faced the Jacksonville Jaguars. Despite Kansas City winning 30-14, the Texas Tech product only completed 22 of 38 passes. While he did manage to pass for 313 yards, he didn’t pass for a touchdown, instead throwing two interceptions. He ended the day with a passer rating of just 62.7, and was only marginally better than the quarterback on the opposing bench that day, Blake Bortles. Mahomes will admit that he was lucky the Chiefs’ defence were on form that day, clocking up five sacks and two interceptions. #2 - vs Denver Broncos, 2021 Denver Broncos v Kansas City Chiefs     One of the worst games of his career came last season, when the Chiefs faced their division rival, the Denver Broncos. The Chiefs won 22-9, but their quarterback only passed for 184 yards, completing just 15 out of 29 passes. His completion percentage was just 51.7%, and to top it off, he only mustered up a passer rating of 57.3, the lowest of his career, according to statmuse.com.  He did run a touchdown in, but it was a rarity to see Mahomes end the day without a passing touchdown, a feat that has only occurred six times in his career thus far. #1 - vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 2020 Super Bowl LV - Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs Kansas City Chiefs     The one game that springs to mind when it comes to Patrick Mahomes’ worst career game is Super Bowl LV. In this game, the Chiefs were taken down 31-9 by Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Mahomes was under duress throughout the game, as he only managed 270 passing yards, zero touchdowns and two interceptions. He was sacked three times and found Buccaneers defenders all over him on every play. The Chiefs’ offensive line crumbled in the big game and the quarterback was running for his life. His passer rating was just 52.3 as he completed just 26 of his 49 passes as Kansas City fell apart in Miami.Doug Kyed@DougKyedSuper Bowl LV passer ratings:Tom Brady: 140.1Patrick Mahomes: 37.43105399Super Bowl LV passer ratings:Tom Brady: 140.1Patrick Mahomes: 37.4😬     \",\n",
       " \"When was Aaron Donald drafted?  Los Angeles Rams' legend Aaron Donald was drafted in 2014 by the then-St. Louis Rams. Donald was selected as the 13th pick in the first round of the 2014 Draft out of Pittsburgh University.  The Rams drafted Donald due to his elite performances at the college level, his versatility on defense, and his freakishly strong frame. The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania native was expected to be selected in the lottery of the 2014 Draft, but he ended up slipping to the midway point of the draft.

Aaron Donald has had a Hall of Fame-worthy NFL career, and the crazy part is that he hasn't even played up to ten seasons yet. Donald has racked up many accolades in his nine years, including three NFL Defensive Player of the Year Awards, seven first-team All-Pro selections, nine Pro Bowl selections, and a Super Bowl win (LVI). He has been a pivotal part of the Rams' defense from the moment he stepped into the locker room to this very moment.     Aaron Donald is the primary reason the Los Angeles Rams came out victorious in Super Bowl LVI, as he kept the Cincinnati Bengals offense at bay. Donald has put up an impressive stat line of 489 tackles, 103 sacks, and 24 forced fumbles in 138 games. Donald is the best at what he does, and the Los Angeles Rams would be far worse without him in their lineup.

       " \"NFL Injury News: Rams QB Jared Goff undergoes thumb surgery  Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jared Goff underwent surgery to repair his broken right thumb. Goff suffered the injury in L.A.'s loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday.  This is a huge blow to the Rams and their playoff hopes. The Rams will head into Week 17 with a lot on the line against the Arizona Cardinals, and they won't have their franchise quarterback.        The Rams will turn to backup QB John Wolford to be the starter against the Cardinals. This will be the biggest game of Wolford's career. It will also be the first start of his NFL career.           How will Jared Goff's absence impact the Los Angeles Rams in Week 17 and the NFL Playoffs?  What could happen to the Rams in Week 17 Los Angeles Rams need to win against the Arizona Cardinals or have the Chicago Bears lose to the Green Bay Packers to secure a 2020 NFL Playoff spot.  This may be tough without starting quarterback Jared Goff but they will most likely be a No. 6 or No. 7 seed in the NFC. Head coach Sean McVay has said that the Los Angeles Rams are going to try and sign Blake Bortles to back up John Wolford in case things go wrong. Rams’ QB Jared Goff underwent surgery today on his broken right thumb in LA and is unlikely to play Sunday vs. Arizona, sources tell ESPN. If he can’t play Sunday, Goff could return for the playoffs if Rams advance there.John Wolford is Goff’s backup and now in line to start.— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 29, 2020     The Rams have one of the best defenses in the NFL and will need them in Week 17. Arizona Cardinals were dominated by the Los Angeles Rams defense in their last meeting. Worst case scenario for the Los Angeles Rams is if they lose to Arizona and Chicago wins against Green Bay. If this were to happen the Los Angeles Rams would miss the 2020 NFL Playoffs. This would be one of the biggest collapses in recent years in the NFL if the Rams were to miss the playoffs. They were 9-4 sitting at the top of the NFC West and lost two straight games. One of those games being against the 0-13 New York Jets.  Will Jared Goff return for the NFL Playoffs? Los Angeles Rams and Head Coach Sean McVay are optimistic that Jared Goff will be available for the 2020 NFL Playoffs. During the 20-9 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 16, Jared Goff would pop his dislocated thumb back into place. After the game it was confirmed that the thumb was broken.     #InjuryReport 🚨- Cool video alert! Jared Goff dislocates his thumb mid-game, and the camera catches him reducing it himself pic.twitter.com/37BHMLpEQB— The Injury Guy (@thatinjuryguy) December 28, 2020 Jared Goff would undergo surgery that included screws being placed to repair the thumb. It would be an amazing comeback if we see Jared Goff start the Wild Card game for the Los Angeles Rams. Sean McVay feels confident in back up quarterback John Wolford even though he has never started in an NFL game.If the Los Angeles Rams want to make a run in the 2020 NFL Playoffs they will need Jared Goff to be their starting quarterback.     \"]"
