0,Cooper Rush,"['Colin Cowherd feels Cooper Rush isn\'t far away from Dak Prescott as Cowboys QB1  Backup quarterback Cooper Rush, who has filled in for an injured Dak Prescott, led the Dallas Cowboys to a third straight win this season as they defeated their division rivals the Washington Commanders in Week 4 by 25-10.  Rush is now 4-0 as the Cowboys\' starting quarterback, and he has kept the team afloat in the absence of Prescott, who suffered a thumb injury in Week 1 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.                     Following another great performance from Cooper Rush, Colin Cowherd is confident that the Cowboys have two QB1s as the gap between Dak Prescott and Cooper Rush is not that big. Here\'s what Cowherd said: ""Most people aren\'t saying Cooper Rush is Dak Prescott, but he\'s won four straight starts. Okay, right. Teddy Bridgewater. won five straight starts for the saints as a backup. Why? Because Teddy Bridgewater is an arguable starter. He\'s a low end starter or a great backup. Cooper Rush is a great backup. Or perhaps he\'s a low end starter.""     Colin Cowherd added: ""Well, most of us and most people I know in the league consider Dak Prescott, a middle of the pack starter. So Dak is better than Cooper rush. But it\'s not a huge gap."" Cowherd continued: ""If you put Dak on the field going up against Cooper rush, Dak better, a little better. And that\'s why paying him $40 million is sort of a cautionary tale on what happens when you don\'t have a quarterback that can elevate others..."" ESPN@espn4-0  Cooper Rush becomes the first QB in Cowboys history to win each of his first four career starts.179551313     Although Dak Prescott is better than Cooper Rush on paper, the backup quarterback has certainly raised his value to the franchise. There might be other teams as well who might look to get Rush, as he has arguably played better than many quarterbacks in the league.  Dak Prescott is expected to make his much-awaited return against the Los Angeles Rams next week Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Dallas Cowboys     Barring any late setbacks, Prescott is scheduled to make his return from injury next week against the Los Angeles Rams. It is certainly not the most ideal game for him to make his return as the Rams will possess a tough challenge for the Cowboys. In his absence, the Cowboys have won all three games, and now Prescott will be making his return against the reigning Super Bowl champs. Pickswise@PickswiseDak Prescott watching Cooper Rush go 3-0 as a starting QB:4001555 Following the game against the Rams, the Cowboys will face the high-flying Eagles, and there is a high possibility that Prescott could be under pressure if he doesn\'t get a positive result in either of those games. It will be interesting to see how the Cowboys fare with Prescott back.     If you use any of the above quotes, please credit the Colin Cowherd podcast and H/T Sportskeeda.     ', ""Does Cowboys backup QB Cooper Rush have what it takes to replace Dak Prescott in 2023?  Due to his difficult season, Dak Prescott's time as the Dallas Cowboys' starting quarterback may be coming to an end. He had a point to make in the playoffs that would have helped quell some playoff scrutiny, but he fell short of expectations again.  With 15 interceptions, Prescott is atop the league with Houston's Davis Mills. Prescott has passed for 166 touchdowns and 24,943 yards in his seven-year tenure. But he also has 52 fumbles and 65 interceptions.        So, you can see why owner Jerry Jones was so taken with the stand-in Cooper Rush while Prescott was injured, especially considering Prescott's 2-4 postseason record. We have seen Prescott suffer from injuries even just this season, but will Rush be able to take over entirely as the Cowboys' main quarterback?           PhillySports (J) ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚õÑÔ∏èüéÑüéÑ@Philly_SportssAre we absolutely certain Dak Prescott is better than Cooper rush ?657 From the second to the sixth week of the regular season, Cooper Rush started at quarterback. He performed so effectively that several observers and fans were rooting for him to keep starting even after Prescott was healthy.     Rush had 956 yards, five scores, and three interceptions through those five starts. In three of the games, he completed more than 60% of his throws, and he finished with an 81.9 quarterback rating throughout that span. After handing Prescott his starting job back, the Cowboys ended the regular season with a 12-5 mark, placing them second in the NFC East. NFL@NFLThe final play that sends the @49ers to the NFC Championship! #NFLPlayoffs88311380 Rush has participated in 19 games in his career, completing 59.0% of his throws for 1,475 yards, 8 TDs, and 4 INTs. Although he goes by the name Rush, he is not particularly adept at rushing. Rush has only carried the ball 20 times for 11 yards.     Dak Prescott has barely completed half of a four-year, $160 million contract. From a strictly financial standpoint, the Cowboys are unable to end things with Prescott because he will receive a guaranteed $31 million for the upcoming season. He likely won't be dealt, but if he fails to get a solid start in 2023, there may be good cause to believe Cooper Rush will replace him as the starter. The Cowboys and possibly other quarterback-needy franchises now have something to discuss, thanks to Rush's good performances. It remains to be seen what awaits the 29-year-old in the offseason. Cooper Rush‚Äôs timeline Cooper Rush started 49 games for Central Michigan University, accumulating 12,891 yards and 90 TDs in the air. However, he wasn't selected in the 2017 NFL draft. As a sophomore, Rush threw for an NCAA bowl record seven touchdowns and led CMU in a 49-48 loss to Western Kentucky in the 2014 Bahamas Bowl. Rush's pass on the final play led to a wild 75-yard touchdown that pulled the Chippewas, who had trailed 49-14, to within one point, but his two-point conversion pass was unsuccessful.     Barstool Sports@barstoolsportsSkip thinks Cooper Rush would‚Äôve beat the 49ers yesterday. Embrace debate3732152 The Dallas Cowboys recognized his potential and acquired him as a free agent. He left Dallas because there weren't many chances for him, so he spent five months with the New York Giants, but when he still wasn't given enough time on the field there, he moved back to the Cowboys.Rush has spent six years as a Dallas player. When Prescott hurt his right thumb this season, he started five games, winning four straight.     "", 'NFL analyst claims Cooper Rush lost the starting job on Sunday Night Football  Cooper Rush entered Week 6 of the 2022 NFL season as an undefeated quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. He won all of his first five starts for the team, including going a perfect 4-0 in his first four games this campaign. He has been filling in for injured starter Dak Prescott since Week 1.  All of that changed in Sunday Night Football when he was defeated by the Philadelphia Eagles. With the loss, the Cowboys fell to 4-2 this season. Max Kellerman recently discussed his opinion on what the loss means for Rush and the Cowboys\' starting quarterback situation. Here\'s what he said during an episode of Keyshawn JWill & Max:        ""Imagine if he wins that game and Dak is ready against Detroit. I\'m still going with Cooper Rush until he loses, but‚Ä¶ it worked out perfectly for the Cowboys because they won every game. Now it\'s the perfect time to bring Dak back against Detroit. You lose to Philly. There\'s no issue, no nothing. You bring him right back.""                   Kellerman made it clear that if Rush had pulled off a victory against the Eagles in Week 6, the Cowboys could have stuck with him. That didn\'t happen, so he thinks it\'s time to move Rush back to the bench and prepare Prescott for Week 7 against the Detroit Lions. Has Cooper Rush failed in not securing the starting QB job for the Cowboys? Dallas Cowboys QB2 Cooper Rush     Cooper Rush has exceeded expectations while filling in for Dak Prescott as the starting quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. Many around the league believed the Cowboys were doomed when Prescott fractured his thumb during their Week 1 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Rush has proved the doubters wrong with his performances Not only did Cooper Rush stabilize the Cowboys, he helped them thrive. They recorded four consecutive wins prior to their loss against the Eagles in Week 6. This has kept them in contention for the NFC East division title and another trip to the playoffs.         While winning games is always the most important thing, their offense has suffered in Prescott\'s absence. The Cowboys led the entire NFL in total yards and points per game during the 2021 NFL season. However, they rank in the bottom ten in both categories this season. With the exception of being absolutely spectacular, Rush was always going to just be a fill-in quarterback until Prescott returned. It\'s unlikely he would have replaced Prescott permanently, considering the organization\'s overall commitment to their current franchise quarterback.Cooper Rush didn\'t fail by any stretch of the imagination. He\'s proven to be a reliable back-up quarterback and could possibly earn another look as a starter down the road.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Keyshawn JWill & Max and H/T Sportskeeda.

Backup quarterback Cooper Rush has been filling in for the injured Dak Prescott. He has taken the league by storm after going above and beyond everyone's expectations.

Cowboys face Cooper Rush - Dak Prescott dilemma Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott recently had stitches removed from his surgically repaired thumb. He suffered an injury in the opening gameweek against the Buccaneers and is still recovering. Now back to throwing a football, sources suggest that the quarterback could be eyeing a comeback for next week's tie against the Rams.     Owner Jerry Jones has suggested that Dallas could have a real quarterback competition on their hands. Despite Rush's stellar performances of late, it will be difficult for the team to sit out their franchise QB. Here's what Jones said about the situation: ‚ÄúIf he comes in here and plays as well as Prescott played, Rush played that well over these next games, I‚Äôd walk to New York to get that. Do I think that it‚Äôs possible for Rush to come in here and play at a level to win games the way Prescott did when he took over for Romo? Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

"", 'Skip Bayless slams Dak Prescott\'s performance in the loss vs. Tom Brady and Buccaneers  Fox Sports\' Undisputed co-host Skip Bayless slammed Dak Prescott for his performance against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday Night Football. The Cowboys were held to just three points and were the only team in Week 1 not to score a touchdown.  Prescott looked like a quarterback who had not played any proper football for months, and it showed as he completed 14 of his 29 passes for 134 yards and an interception. Bayless was not happy with what he saw from the Cowboys signal-caller and slammed him for his performance on Undisputed.        ‚ÄúDid I overestimate the fourth-round pick? Who plays occasionally like he‚Äôs the fourth-overall pick, but too often he plays like a fourth-round pick.

Dak Prescott struggles in Cowboys\' season opener Dak Prescott (under helmet) during the Cowboys\' season-opening game It was hard on the eyes and even harder for Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night. The Tampa Bay defense, led by Todd Bowles, made life very difficult for the Cowboys offense.        The game started brightly for Dallas as they drove down the field and scored what would be their only points of the game. After that, it was tough sledding for Dallas as their receivers simply could not get open. Prescott often forced the ball into tight coverage and was lucky not to be picked off more than once. The Buccaneers held Dallas to 3/15 on third down as the offense could not move the ball at all and kept the home side to 2/5 on fourth down. They also kept the Cowboys offense to just 3.8 yards per play.

', ""Who is the starting QB for the Dallas Cowboys in Week 7 vs. Detroit Lions?  The Dallas Cowboys are 4-2 to begin the 2022 NFL season. The Cowboys did this mostly without franchise quarterback Dak Prescott who got hurt in the first game of the season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It was a game that Prescott wasn't playing well in.   Prescott was ruled out of the next five games following the Week 1 matchup against Tom Brady and the Bucs, and career backup QB Cooper Rush took his place.        Cooper Rush was amazing in steadying the ship in Prescott's absence. His ball retention skills ensured that the Dallas Cowboys didn't need to dip into free agency to mitigate the loss of Dak Prescott.            Rush totalled 1,020 passing yards, five touchdowns, and three interceptions in the matches that Prescott missed due to his fractured thumb in Dallas' Week 1 loss to the Buccaneers. His form was so good that sports analysts called for him to be given the starting quarterback gig full-time even after Prescott returned from injury.  However, such calls were immediately jettisoned after Rush's flaws were laid bare in his iffy performance against the unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles. Then, on Thursday, the former Pro Bowler Prescott told reporters that he is playing on Sunday when the Dallas Cowboys play host to the Lions in Week 7. This message led to mixed reactions from Cowboys fans as some seem to want Cooper Rush at the center. Many others though, are glad to get Dak Prescott back calling the shots.     Though it is not 100% certain, Dak Prescott looks set to start against the Lions, as the locker room leader would be looking to restart his 2022 season immediately.          View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post How have the Dallas Cowboys' quarterbacks faired this season? The Dallas Cowboys quarterbacks' performances have been one of the more interesting subplots in the 2022 NFL season thus far, with each week bringing a new script to analyze. Dak Prescott is the undisputed starter for the Dallas Cowboys, and he has been since he was drafted by Jerry Jones and Co. in 2016. He had a solid preseason, and it looked like he was about to prove that he wasn't a flash in the pan and that the league hadn't seen his peak yet.          However, a mixture of bad luck and poor protection from his guards led him to leave the Week 1 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with a fractured right thumb.  As a result of the injury, Prescott had not seen the Gridiron since Week 1, when he threw a pick in an opening game loss against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Prescott will be looking to take his spot under center in the Week 7 matchup against the 1-4 Detroit Lions.     On the other hand, Cooper Rush just did his legacy a lot of favor with how he performed in the five games he started in place of the then-injured Dak Prescott.  The shot caller put up career numbers across the board and showed the rest of the league that he is much more than a footnote in the Cowboys' QB room. He was so good that there were whispers that the Dallas Cowboys might just stick with him at QB even when Dak is back from injury. That wasn't the case, but we doubt Rush would be too displeased with his start to the 2022 NFL season.

After back-up Cooper Rush managed to secure a crucial win over the Vikings last week in Prescott\'s absence, the Cowboys\' No. 4 was back under center.  Dallas was a double-digit favorite as they welcomed the 4-4 Denver Broncos and many expected them to rack up points, as they have done all season.        From the get-go, it was evident that Dak Prescott and the Cowboys just were not at the races. Missed passes from Prescott, dropped passes from receivers and the defense\'s inability to stop anything the Broncos did on offense was hard to watch.           While the Broncos only mustered two sacks (both to Jonathon Cooper), Prescott was under duress for the majority of the game and his quarterback play mirrored a player who was under constant pressure. Bayless not pleased with Prescott\'s for poor showing Dak\'s poor play did not escape the eye of Fox Sports\' Undisputed co-host Skip Bayless. With Prescott scheduled to make an eye-watering $75 million this season, Bayless was so unimpressed with his quarterback\'s play that he took to Twitter to vent his frustration.

While the score describes a close game with just two scores between the sides (30-16), delving into the stats tells a story. The Broncos had more total yards (407 to 290), had more rushing yards (190 to 78), went at over 50 percent on third down and had total clock command, amassing 41 minutes and 12 seconds of possession time to the Cowboys just 18:48.

However, viewers will remember the quarterback hobbling around a bit in the first half of the game. He never missed time, but the quarterback is no longer 100 percent. Here's a look at the injury suffered by the quarterback.  According to Pro Football Talk and The Athletic, team owner Jerry Jones said the quarterback had hyperextended his knee. After the injury, the owner quickly checked in with the sideline about his status. Of course, viewers know that he was good enough to finish the game.        Will the Dallas Cowboys finally stack playoff wins for the first time since the 1990s?            Looking ahead, the question becomes whether the quarterback will see a complete recovery in the ten-day break between games.

Prescott really struggled to get anything going against the Buccaneers defense, as the Cowboys offense was basically shut down completely. Dak Prescott completed less than 50 percent of his passes and threw an interception in a forgettable performance.        While the disastrous game alone would have been bad news for the Cowboys, things got much worse for them during the fourth quarter of the game. Dak Prescott injured his thumb and will reportedly require surgery to repair the damage to his throwing hand.

', 'NFL Rumors: Washington Commanders make big decision regarding franchise\'s future  The Washington Commanders have officially made a change. After Carson Wentz went down, Taylor Heinicke stepped in as his backup, starting games much like he\'s done intermittently over the last couple of seasons. Going forward, regardless of Wentz\'s health, Heinicke will be the starter.  NFL insider Ian Rapoport reported the change:        ""Taylor Heinicke once again the starting quarterback for the Washington Commanders today and with Carson Wentz nearing full health- he was cleared to throw on the side this past week. My understanding is that Heinicke is expected to be the starter moving forward.""           He continued: ""Here\'s the way it is explained to me. He\'s the starter until he\'s not. In other words, until his performance necessitates a change, which no one expects, Taylor Heinicke is slated to be the starter. Think of how the team rallies around him, how they play for him. Consider that he is 3-1 as the starter."" Ian Rapoport@RapSheetFrom @NFLGameDay: The #Commanders expect Taylor Heinicke to be their QB moving foward, while the #Steelers may have found the right formula for RB Najee Harris.2     According to Rapoport, the quarterback has played himself into the starting role. It\'s hard to imagine the stunning victory over the previously unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles didn\'t play a part in the decision.  What is Taylor Heiniecke\'s record with the Washington Commanders and other teams? As a starter this season, Heinicke has gone 3-1 for the Commanders. Last season, he was 7-8 in Washington as the starter. He also played for Washington in 2020 but did not make a start.        He previously played for the Carolina Panthers and Houston Texans, but he started one game in those two seasons while appearing in seven. He lost his only start with the Panthers in 2018. Washington is 5-5 and in the hunt for a playoff spot. They\'re currently a half game behind the San Francisco 49ers for the final NFC playoff spot and are hoping the change to Heinicke puts them over the top. If he can continue his successful record, it could very well propel them into the playoffs. It might even leave Wentz looking for a new home yet again this offseason. He was brought in via trade last offseason to provide stability at quarterback but has thus far failed to do so.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit NFL Network and H/T Sportskeeda.

So far, Wentz has led the Commanders to a win against the Jacksonville Jaguars and a loss to the Detroit Lions in Week 2.

Wentz also earned a Pro Bowl nod as a member of the Eagles in 2017, a second-team All-Pro nod in the same 2017 season, and a Super Bowl LII win. He left the Eagles before the 2021 NFL season to sign a contract with the Indianapolis Colts.

Barstool Sports@barstoolsportsThe Colts mascot has had it with Carson Wentz8871546 The next stop for Wentz was the Indianapolis Colts in 2021. It was a team that had developed a reputation for signing veteran quarterbacks and compelling them to fit into their offense, rather than building their offense around a veteran QB.      Carson Wentz's time with the Colts wasn't wrong, but he finished the season with a losing record, and both parties knew they needed to get what they signed up for.

Victories are even more impressive if they happen while missing a star wide receiver, running back, or offensive lineman.   The best quarterbacks find ways to will their squad to triumph, even if they are not at full strength. That leadership gives confidence to everyone in the huddle, motivating them to excel.        Getting more wins can lead to playoff appearances, conference championship games, and Super Bowl titles. The quarterbacks on this list have made it to those games, but with varying results. At some point, however, the wins trickled, if not stopped. Be it Father Time or something else, these players are no longer dependable signal callers.           Here are the quarterbacks who might have played their last snap during the 2022 NFL season. The possibility of getting another contract is dwindling as their recent performances indicate it‚Äôs time to go. They‚Äôve had their time, but the game will move on without them in pads and uniforms. Which 5 NFL quarterbacks could be out of the league in ahead of the 2023 season? 5. Joe Flacco Baltimore Ravens fans were surprised when Joe Flacco became the 18th overall selection in the 2008 NFL Draft. Aside from playing for a small school, Flacco even asked his coach to play baseball because he was not confident about his prospects. But the University of Delaware alumnus brought stability to a position where the Ravens struggled to find long-term solutions.

But since then, he has bounced around the league, suiting up for the Denver Broncos, Philadelphia Eagles, and New York Jets (twice). He took over from Zach Wilson in five games in the 2022 season but won only one game. There are better options at quarterback than the 38-year-old Flacco. 4. Josh Johnson NFC Championship - San Francisco 49ers v Philadelphia Eagles     Josh Johnson was also selected in the 2008 draft, 142 spots after Flacco. He‚Äôs a journeyman who has suited up for 14 NFL teams in 15 seasons. He also played for the Los Angeles Wildcats for one XFL season. Johnson had his fourth stint with the San Francisco 49ers in 2022 and played two games.

Credit his agent, Tom Condon, for negotiating that caveat into his contract. While he will still receive financial rewards, Matt Ryan faltered in his attempt to lead the Colts to the playoffs.

', 'Why is Carson Wentz not playing tonight? Reason why the former Eagles QB is benched by Commanders  The 4-5 Washington Commanders are taking on the perfect 8-0 Philadelphia Eagles today, but Carson Wentz is nowhere to be seen. The former Eagles quarterback\'s absence is conspicuous; instead, Taylor Heinicke is starting.  The Commanders placed Wentz on the Injured Reserves list on October 22 after he underwent surgery to fix a fractured finger. The quarterback is eligible to return in Week 11 but will likely be Heinicke\'s backup.        Wentz being relegated to the backup role is not surprising. Heinicke has started in Carson Wentz\'s place in the last three games and has a 2-1 record. It would have been 3-0 if they had not collapsed late against the Minnesota Vikings. With Wentz, the Commanders had a 2-4 record. It is generally not surprising to see a winning quarterback take over for a quarterback with a losing record.           Furthermore, head coach Ron Rivera has been critical of Wentz in the past, putting down their struggles solely to their quarterback position. Hence, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that he would choose Heinicke to start instead. PointsBet Sportsbook@PointsBetUSA""Why are the other NFC East teams ahead of you?""""Quarterback.""Ron Rivera threw Carson Wentz straight under the bus 1795237     Also, when the Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Commanders met earlier in September, the Commanders lost 24-8. It was a personal trial for Wentz as he was sacked nine times by his former team, which seemed bent on exacting revenge on their former quarterback. So, there are a myriad reasons to bench Wentz for this game. Based on his previous performances against this opposition, lack of faith from the coach, and his general lackluster performances, it should not be a surprise.  But the reason that Carson Wentz is not starting today is more academic. He fractured his finger in Week 6, playing against the Chicago Bears, and was accordingly placed on injured reserve. That means he will be eligible to return after this week and is presently inactive. Will Carson Wentz remain a backup for the Commanders even after the Eagles game?     A lot depends on how Taylor Heinicke performs today against the Philadelphia Eagles to determine if Carson Wentz has a chance of retaining the starting role next week. If Heinicke can knock off the undefeated NFL leaders against all odds, the clamor for him to be retained will grow. Heinicke is also familiar with being the starting quarterback having played that role the entirety of last season when Ryan Fitzpatrick went down injured. Mark Bullock@MarkBullockNFLNot a great start for Washington. Leno beat to the edge and Heinicke gets taken down for a sack-fumble11 However, it is not going to be easy. He was already strip-sacked once in the game. To his credit, though, he rebounded to lead the Commanders to 20-14 over the Eagles at halftime. If he maintains that level of play, Carson Wentz will be left sweating and hoping his injury heals fast enough before the window for his possible return closes.

When Wentz got hurt during training camp, most of the analysis was about how they needed him back as soon as possible, because the Colts' early schedule was really difficult to pull through with a backup quarterback. That concern still stands. Seattle Seahawks v Indianapolis Colts     The Colts are 0-2 to start the season after two home losses and they now face three straight away games against the Titans, Dolphins and Ravens. There's a real possibility that Indianapolis may be 0-5 three weeks from now with losses to teams that may be fighting for a wild-card spot at the end of the season, which gives them a disadvantage in terms of tiebreakers. For a team that started the season with high expectations and is now on the verge of a quick collapse, losing the starting quarterback for more than a month would be downright calamitous, especially considering backup quarterback Jacob Eason is miles behind in terms of experience and quality.

The former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback had a huge injury history when the Colts traded for him in February, and his first season in Indianapolis has seen him affected by major health problems twice already. Wentz suffered a torn ACL in 2017 during his second season with the Eagles, and while the team went on to win its first Super Bowl ever, his knee affected him over the next offseason. He ended up missing a couple of games in 2018 because of the injury. That same year, he also had a back problem that ended his season prematurely. Nick Foles stepped up in his place both times, winning playoff games in both seasons with the Eagles. Not only did Foles have playoff success, but Wentz's health made some people question whether the Eagles should've kept Foles instead of Wentz.     In 2020, a rare healthy season for Wentz, the problem was that he was mentally broken, and his performance was so disastrous that the Eagles had no other option than to let him go.The team received two high-draft picks, and considering what they are seeing from Indianapolis so far, they will likely be happy with the trade.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 3 TV Schedule     "", ""Carson Wentz's net worth: How much is the ex-commanders QB worth in 2023?

Carson Wentz had an average 2022 season in which he performed below expectations as a member of the Washington Commanders, which expected to make the postseason due to the strength of their existing roster with the addition of an elite NFL starting quarterback in Wentz.  However, they finished at the bottom of the NFC East, becoming the only side in the division not to make the postseason.Wentz put up a stat line of 1,755 passing yards, 11 touchdowns, and nine interceptions in eight games for the Commanders. He gave the team no other option than to release him, and they did just that in the opening weeks of the 2023 offseason.     ""]"
3,Trevor Siemian,"[""Who is Trevor Siemian? NFL star's electrifying performance for Bears in preseason gets fans talking  Trevor Siemian is the backup quarterback for the Chicago Bears. He was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the seventh round of the 2015 NFL Draft. He was the backup to Peyton Manning in SuperBowl 50, where they won by a score of 24-10 over the Carolina Panthers.  In his four years at Northwestern University, he totaled just 27 passing touchdowns with 24 interceptions and rushed for -23 yards. Siemian has mostly been a reliable backup option for teams around the league after the 2016 season in which he was the starter for the Broncos. In his three years at Denver, he played 26 games, throwing 30 touchdowns and 24 interceptions for 5,686 yards.        He played 11 games in the 2017 season, after which he was traded to the Minnesota Vikings to be the backup for Kirk Cousins. Since then, he has been on the roster for the New York Jets, Tennessee Titans and New Orleans Saints. In 2022 he signed a two-year contract with the Chicago Bears and played in the team's first preseason game.           He impressed the fans after a solid performance, delivering 7-of-13 for 89 yards with two touchdowns and a 115.1 passer rating. Here are some of the tweets praising the quarterback: Jarrett Payton@paytonsunTrevor Siemian showing the touch on the throw and a good understanding of this offense. #Bears1448     Herb Howard@HerbHoward411#Bears backup QB Trevor Siemian is a very accurate passer.205 Kris üåª@KrisArmstrong1One of my takeaways from today‚Äôs game is that Trevor Siemian played well.

In 33 career games with them, he recorded 57 receptions for 598 yards and four touchdowns. He suffered several injuries during his first three years and was finally traded to the Bears in 2022.        On the first play of training camp, he suffered an ankle injury after a collision with linebacker Nicholas Marrow. He underwent surgery on Thursday, August 11 and is expected to be out for nearly eight weeks. In Chicago, he joined a receiving corps consisting of Darnell Mooney, Byron Pringle and Equanimeous St. Brown. Harry is an explosive player with a knack for catching the ball in traffic and making big plays. Upon returning to full health, he will undoubtedly be a huge boost for the team's offense.We will see Siemian in action throughout the preseason and Harry in the regular season once he has recovered from injury.     "", 'Russell Wilson trade rumors: NFL analyst drops massive trade hint\xa0  Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks\' 2021-22 season is not going the way they expected at the start of the campaign. In fact, this is the first time the Seahawks will finish with a losing record in Wilson‚Äôs storied 10-year career in Seattle. The Seahawks suffered a 20-10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams on Tuesday in what was a below-par performance from Seattle\'s offense.  The defeat to the Rams dropped the Seahawks to 5-9 and ended their hopes of making it to the NFL playoffs this season. A finger injury forced him to miss three games but many felt the quarterback rushed his return, resulting in below-par performances. Per multiple reports over the last two weeks, the 33-year-old quarterback is expected to make a move to a Super Bowl contender in 2022.                   Russell Wilson trade on the cards in 2022 Wilson was reportedly open to a trade last offseason, but he later denied the claims and stayed in Seattle. He said: ""There was a lot of people, there was a whole thing saying I requested a trade, and that\'s just not true. I didn\'t request a trade. Everything kind of started from there. Obviously, tons of teams were calling and I think that the reality was I didn\'t want to go anywhere else, I wanted to play in Seattle. But if I had to go somewhere, these are the teams I would go to or consider. At the end of the day I have a no-trade clause, right?"" Ian Rapoport@RapSheetFrom NFL Now: #Seahawks coach Pete Carroll doesn\'t believe QB Russell Wilson needs rest. He needs reps.11:49 PM ¬∑ Dec 2, 202142349     With the way the season has gone by, rumors of Wilson\'s possible landing spots are doing the rounds on social media again. In the latest episode of ESPN\'s Get Up, NFL analyst Mike Tannenbaum revealed the one NFC team that will suit Wilson best next year. He explained: ""It\'s the New Orleans Saints and the day he walks in that building. They are instant Super Bowl contenders. And here\'s why. They\'re going to get back Michael Thomas. They have Alvin Kamara. We\'ve already seen Greeny over the last two years. They have a championship defense. Just go ask Tom Brady. So you bring in Russell Wilson with that nucleus. They are in the Super Bowl conversation. ""        The deal could work wonders for both the Saints and Seahawks. New Orleans eye a considerable upgrade at quarterback, while the Seahawks are in desperate need of some first-round draft picks. To get the most value for Wilson, the Seahawks will look to trade him with a few years remaining on his deal rather than next offseason as his contract runs through 2023. Ian Rapoport@RapSheetSources: The #Saints appear poised to make a QB change. Taysom Hill is taking first-team reps this week in practice in preparation to face the #Cowboys. Trevor Siemian is taking No. 2 reps.01:04 AM ¬∑ Nov 30, 20217646951 Meanwhile, Wilson\'s on-field struggles indicate two things. First, he isn\'t the same game-changing quarterback who can steady the ship even in crunch situations. Second, the 33-year-old isn\'t the perfect match for the current Saints setup. If Wilson is looking to leave the Seahawks in search of a well-balanced team with a solid balance between offense and defense, the Saints could be the answer or the Denver Broncos next year.     ', 'Is Justin Fields playing tonight vs the New York Jets? Week 12 fantasy outlook and potential replacements for the Bears QB  Fans and fantasy managers around the globe are more than eager to know whether or not Justin Fields, the Chicago Bears quarterback, will play in Week 12. Although he is listed as questionable for the game against the New York Jets, it is highly unlikely that Fields will play tonight.  He is still recovering from a shoulder injury and the franchise doesn\'t want to risk him in this game. Once he\'s 100% healthy, he\'ll be back on the field, as Fields has played exceptionally well this season and they won\'t want to risk his development.        A few days ago, Bears head coach Matt Eberflus gave an update on Justin Fields\' injury. Here\'s what he said:           ""Justin\'s status is the same, you know, it\'s limited. He was limited his day in practice. So we\'ll see where it goes. He\'s feeling better, every single day. And we got 48 hours to assess that, to where we\'re gonna go with that. It\'s the same thing with this, you know, it\'s limited because of his shoulder."" Eberflus added: ""He\'s able to do a lot of things, you know, so we\'re getting them in there with what he can do. And he\'s been doing good in there. We\'ll see where it goes. Like I said, it\'s really a three-prong effect."" He continued:     ""You know, it\'s really more about the medical staff clear him all the way into that status. And then, you know, him feeling really good about his performance, being able to go out there and perform and then us coaches assessing where he is.""      The consensus is that with the BEars standing at 3-8, they have no realistic hopes of making the playoffs. Therefore, there is no benefit to risking their budding superstar for a potentially pointless matchup.     Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterJustin Fields, listed as questionable for Sunday due to his separated shoulder, is not expected to play vs. the Jets, per sources. Bears are expected to start QB Trevor Siemian, and the team also promoted Nathan Peterman from the practice squad Saturday to serve as the backup QB.4112471 Trevor Semien is expected to start for the Chicago Bears against the New York Jets in Week 12. Justin Fields\' absence will be felt immensely by the Bears as he has played the best football of his NFL career this campaign. Mike White will be the starting quarterback for the Jets as they have decided to bench Zach Wilson after last week\'s loss to the New England Patriots.  Alternative Week 12 fantasy options for Justin Fields     Justin Fields during Chicago Bears v Atlanta Falcons Justin Fields not playing against the Jets will be a huge blow for many fantasy football players, but there are other alternatives as well to replace the Bears quarterback. There are two quarterbacks that we believe are plausible trade targets (if your league hasn\'t passed/doesn\'t have a trade deadline). Justin Herbert, the quarterback for the Los Angeles Chargers, could be up for a big game. They will play the Arizona Cardinals, who have been quite poor defensively this season.     Another quarterback who could be up for a big game is Lamar Jackson, who\'ll be facing the Jacksonville Jaguars. He can get you a good amount of points as the Ravens will need to rely on him to get a win over the Jaguars.Potential streamers for Week 12 include:Tom Brady, Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Cleveland BrownsJimmy Garoppolo, San Francisco 49ers vs. New Orleans SaintsTrevor Lawrence, Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Baltimore RavensAaron Rodgers, Green Bay Packers vs. Philadelphia EaglesMatt Ryan, Indianapolis Colts vs. Pittsburgh SteelersRyan Tennehill, Tennessee Titans vs. Cincinnati BengalsTaylor Heinicke, Washington Commanders vs. Atlanta Falcons     ', ""Broncos QBs since Peyton Manning: Every starter since Hall of Famer retired in 2016  Ever since Peyton Manning retired in 2016, after winning his second Super Bowl overall and his first with the Denver Broncos, the franchise has gone through upheaval every year at the quarterback position. It is a notoriously difficult place to fill at the best of times, but it is especially difficult when someone is trying to replace an all-time great like Peyton Manning.  We take a look at every starter who has played for the Denver Broncos in that position since Peyton Manning's retirement. As this has been such an unstable position for the franchise after Peyton Manning, in most seasons, they have had multiple starters in the given position. So, for the purposes of clarity, only those who started most games are listed at the top and others who played in those seasons are mentioned separately.                       Denver Broncos quarterbacks since Peyton Manning retired 2016 and 2017 - Trevor Siemian Right after Peyton Manning retired, Brock Osweiler, who had started some of the games the previous year with Peyton Manning in their Super Bowl-winning season, left for the Houston Texans to become their starter. That opened up the field for third-choice Trevor Siemian to compete with rookie Paxton Lynch and veteran Mark Sanchez, and Siemian eventually became the starter.     James Palmer@JamesPalmerTVTrevor Siemian is the only QB with a winning record for the #Broncos since Peyton Manning retired entering the 2016 seasonTrevor Siemian (13-11), Case Keenum (6-10), Paxton Lynch (1-3), Joe Flacco (0-4) and Brock Osweiler (0-4)35588 In 2016, he played 14 of 16 games for the Denver Broncos (the last two weeks were quarterbacked by Paxton Lynch) and established himself as the first choice. Even though the Broncos missed the playoffs, he finished with a passer rating of 84.6 that was higher than Peyton Manning and Brock Osweiler from the previous season. Over the last six weeks of his season from Weeks 8 to 14, he averaged more than 300 yards, behind only Tom Brady and Kirk Cousins. He was named a Pro Bowl alternate but did not accept the invitation due to the shoulder surgery he went ahead with after Week 14.        In 2017, now firmly established as a starter but under new coach Vance Joseph, he began the season strongly, and the high point was a game against the Dallas Cowboys where he threw four touchdowns. In Week 6, he suffered a shoulder injury. Then, over the next few weeks, his production declined. He was benched in favor of the returning Brock Osweiler in Week 9, who was himself then relieved by Paxton Lynch in Week 12. After Lynch was injured in that game, Siemian got another chance to lead the Broncos. But another shoulder injury in Week 15 spelled the end of his career with the Broncos as Brock Osweiler relieved him in that game and started in Week 16.     2018 - Case Keenum After the upheaval of the previous season, when the Broncos had three quarterbacks trading places, head coach Vance Joseph chose to reunite with former Houston Texans quarterback Case Keenum, who they traded from the Minnesota Vikings. They stuck with him throughout the season and he started all 16 games as the Broncos went 6-10.    He threw for 3,890 yards with a 62.3 completion rate. He had 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, with a 81.2 passer rating. He was traded to the Washington Redskins for a seventh-round pick in 2019.     2019 - Joe Flacco In 2019, the Denver Broncos decided to go with Joe Flacco, who had won one Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens. There were eerie parallels with Peyton Manning as they plumped for a veteran quarterback and former Super Bowl MVP. He was named the starter and had the job until he faced a neck injury in Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts. In those eight games that he started, he had 1,822 passing yards, six touchdowns, five interceptions, and an 85.1 passer rating. He was subsequently released by the Broncos and went on to sign with the New York Jets, where he still is currently.        After Joe Flacco was injured, he was replaced by Brandon Allen for three games before Drew Lock stepped in for the final five games of the season. The rookie quarterback finished with 1,020 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions in those five games and equalled John Elway's franchise record for most wins by a rookie in Broncos history. His four wins came in just five games compared to the 10 taken by Elway. Peter Baugh@Peter_BaughDrew Lock's rookie year stats for the #Broncos: ‚Ä¢5 games played ‚Ä¢1,020 yards (204 a game)‚Ä¢7 TD‚Ä¢3 interceptions ‚Ä¢4-1 record776 2020 - Drew Lock For his performances the previous season, Lock was named the starter for 2020. In Week 2, he injured his shoulder and would not return until Week 6. During that period, Jeff Driskel and Brett Rypien started one game each. In Week 12, due to a COVID outbreak among the quarterback corps, running back Phillip Lindsay started under center.     Lock's performances in his second season were not up to standard. Case in point, he had 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. This was the joint highest in the league , tied with Carson Wentz, despite Lock only playing 13 matches. His 57.3 completion rate was the lowest among all quarterbacks with, at least, 150 passing attempts that season.    2021 - Teddy Bridgewater In 2021, Teddy Bridgewater, the 2015 Pro Bowler, joined the team from the Carolina Panthers. He beat out Drew Lock to become the starter, though Lock started three games in each of which Bridgewater was out injured. In the 13 games that he started, he threw for 3,052 yards, 18 touchdowns, and seven interceptions for a passer rating of 94.9 with a 66.9 completion percentage. At the end of the season, he was traded to the Miami Dolphins as the Denver Broncos acquired Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks.     2022 - Russell Wilson   Russell Wilson joined from the Seattle Seahawks. In a deal that sent Drew Lock to Seattle, along with other players and draft picks, the future hall-of-famer joined the Denver Broncos for a five-year, $245 million deal. The Broncos will hope to replicate the success they had with Peyton Manning when they last had a future hall-of-famer as their quarterback.

Most disappointing QBs of the 2021 NFL season        #5 - Taysom Hill, New Orleans Saints           New Orleans Saints quarterback Taysom Hill Head coach Sean Payton has insisted for a couple of years now that Taysom Hill is a quarterback, not just a utility player. Payton claimed that Hill would eventually be their starting quarterback. Jameis Winston won the job prior to the 2021 NFL season, but after a season-ending injury and another injury to Trevor Siemian, Hill was named the starting quarterback for the final five games.

In two of his starts, he completed less than 50 percent of his passes. He also went without a touchdown pass in two of his five games. #4 - Baker Mayfield, Cleveland Browns Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield Baker Mayfield put together a solid 2020 season. He completed 63 percent of his passes for 3,563 yards with 26 touchdowns and eight interceptions. He appeared to have turned a corner while leading the Cleveland Browns to the playoffs and earning his first postseason victory.

The Browns finished the year with just a 8-9 record and missed out on the 2021 NFL Playoffs. QBs who underwhelmed the most in the 2021 NFL season Here are five quarterbacks from the 2021 NFL season who were the most unimpressive.     #3 - Trevor Lawrence, Jacksonville Jaguars Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevow Lawrence Trevor Lawrence entered the 2021 NFL Draft as one of the highest rated quarterback prospects of all time. He dominated high school and college football, and is believed to possess all of the necessary tools to succeed in the NFL.

He completed less than 60 percent of his passes while throwing 12 touchdowns and a whopping 17 interceptions. He threw multiple interceptions in five different games and played eight separate games without throwing a touchdown pass. The Jaguars finished the season with an abysmal 3-14 record. #2 - Daniel Jones, New York Giants New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones During is 2019 rookie season, Daniel Jones showed a ton of potential. Across 13 games, he threw for 3,027 yards with 24 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. It looked like he was going to have a bright future as the Giants quarterback, but the past two seasons he has heavily regressed.

They won six games in the 2020 season but accumulated just four wins in the 2021 campaign. #1 - Sam Darnold, Carolina Panthers Carolina Panthers quarterback Sam Darnold     Sam Darnold struggled through his first three years with the New York Jets. Many believed he could be a good quarterback but was in too bad of a situation there to succeed. He was traded to the Carolina Panthers prior to the 2021 NFL season, where he would have better coaching and more offensive weapons. It was an excellent opportunity for him to let his talent shine.

Ben Roethlisberger and more  Saturday's Wild Card playoff game saw rookie quarterback Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers defeat the Seattle Seahawks 41-23. It was an impressive display that raised the question of how often quarterbacks lead their teams to playoff wins in their debut seasons.  While many have led their teams to the playoffs, only a select few have managed to achieve the feat of winning a playoff game in their first season. Here is a list of 5 quarterbacks to have won a playoff game in their rookie season.                   #1. Ben Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh Steelers (2004 season)  AFC Wild Card Playoffs - Former Pittsburgh Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Ben Roethlisberger in the first round of the 2004 NFL draft. Initially, he was the third-choice quarterback on the team behind Tommy Maddox and Charlie Batch. However, due to an injury to Batch during the preseason (and poor performances) and an injury to Maddox in Week 3, Roethlisberger was given an opportunity. He led the team to win a playoffs game in his rookie season.

He made his playoff debut in the Divisional round against the New York Jets and helped lead the team to victory in overtime with a game-winning field goal. The Steelers lost the AFC championship game to eventual Super Bowl champions the New England Patriots. #2. Joe Flacco, Baltimore Ravens (2008 season)  New York Jets Joe Flacco     The Baltimore Ravens selected Joe Flacco as the 18th overall pick in 2008 NFL draft. Flacco was meant to be the third-choice quarterback, but due to injuries to starter Kyle Boller and an illness to Tro Smit, Flacco was given the nod. Flacco finished his rookie season with a pass completion percentage of 60.0%, 2,971 yards, and 16 touchdowns. Flacco and the Ravens secured their place in the playoffs and defeated the Miami Dolphins 27-9 in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. Flacco became the first quarterback to win two consecutive playoff games in their rookie season after a 13-10 divisional-round victory over the Tennessee Titans. The Ravens lost the AFC championship game against the Steelers 14-23. #3. Mark Sanchez, New York Jets (2009 season)  Jacksonville Jaguars v New York Jets     Mark Sanchez was taken in the first round of the 2009 NFL draft. The New York Jets traded their first- and second-round selections, as well as three players, to the Cleveland Browns to take him fifth overall. The 2009 season began on a high note for Sanchez, winning three consecutive Pepsi Rookie of the Week awards in the first three weeks of the campaign. He also made history by becoming the first rookie quarterback to start and win his first three NFL games.

In Week 4, Sanchez threw an interception that led to a 99-yard touchdown. In Week 6, he threw five interceptions in a 16-13 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Sanchez and the Jets rallied to finish the regular season with a 9-7 record, securing a spot in the playoffs. In the Wild Card round, they secured a 24-14 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. Sanchez and the team went on to win the Divisional round game against the San Diego Chargers 17-14. Sanchez became the second rookie quarterback in NFL history to win his first two consecutive playoff games following Joe Flacco in 2008. Despite their success, the Jets eventually lost their AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts with a score of 30-17, giving up an 11-point lead. #4. Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks (2012 season) Russell Wilson - St. Louis Rams v Seattle Seahawks, 2012     Russell Wilson was selected by the Seahawks as the 75th overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft. After competing for the starter position with veteran quarterback Matt Flynn and Tarvaris Jackson, Wilson was given the nod for the 2021 season. Wilson threw for 3,118 yards and 26 touchdowns in his rookie season, tying the record set by Peyton Manning for most touchdown passes by a rookie. Wilson's ability as a running quarterback contributed to 489 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. Led by Wilson, the Seahawks secured a playoff spot and went on to win their wild-card round game against the Washington Redskins by a score of 24-14. Wilson had a solid performance, throwing for 187 yards and rushing for 67 yards. They would eventually lose the divisional round game against the Atlanta Falcons by a field goal with 31 seconds left on the clock. #5. Brock Purdy, San Francisco 49ers (2022 season)  NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Seattle Seahawks v San Francisco 49ers     Brock Purdy was selected as the 262nd overall pick in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL draft. After injuries to initial starters Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo, Purdy was given the nod to start in Week 13. To the amazement of many, Purdy put up impressive numbers, throwing for 1,374 yards and 14 total touchdowns in five games as the 49ers starting quarterback. The 49ers met the Seahawks in the Wild Card game of the playoffs and won 41-23.Purdy threw for 332 yards and three passing touchdowns, as well as scoring a rushing touchdown. Purdy will have the chance to become the third rookie quarterback to win consecutive playoff games.     "", ""5 NFL teams that should look to draft Ole Miss QB Matt Corral\xa0  The 2022 NFL Draft is the next major event for the NFL and takes place from April 29th to May 1st. The draft order has been set with the Jacksonville Jaguars owning the first overall pick for the second straight year. One major storyline from the 2022 NFL Draft is the lack of star quarterbacks in the draft class.  Many believe we won't see a quarterback taken within the first ten picks, something that hasn't occurred since 2013 (one of the weakest QB draft classes in the last decade). Kenny Pickett, Malik Willis, and Matt Corral all have the potential to be the first quarterback off the board, but Corral has been consistently climbing the rankings over the last few months.        Matt Corral: Potential 1st QB taken in 2022 NFL Draft           Chick-fil-A Kickoff - Louisville v Ole Miss The bulk of Corral's career at Ole Miss didn't start until 2020, his second season as a starter for the Rebels. After facing mental health difficulties and his troubled past, he was able to get in the right mindset and thrive under his new head coach, Lane Kiffin. In 2019 Corral posted a 59% completion rate of 1,362 passing yards, throwing for six touchdowns and three interceptions. Corral upped the ante in 2020 with a career-high 70.9% completion rate, 3,337 yards, 29 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. In his final year in college, he threw for 3,343 yards on 20 touchdowns and rushed for an additional 11 scores.

Whereas Corral's points of concern have primarily been around his small frame and the slow pace at which he goes through his progressions. Nevertheless, Corral is still an NFL-ready quarterback but one who is best suited to sit as a rookie and take some time to adjust to the pros. With a bounty of quarterback-needy franchises in the draft, here are five teams that should put Matt Corral high on their draft board.     #1 - Washington Commanders have a new NFL brand and need a new NFL quarterback to match Washington Football Team QB Taylor Heinicke Nothing against Taylor Heinicke, but he has seemingly reached his limit in the league as a starter. He's good enough to pull off sneaky comeback victories and take his team to the playoffs in a weak division. But Heinicke is not the guy to take Washington deep into the postseason or lead the franchise longterm.     Damien Bartonek üá®üáø@DABartonekTaylor Heinicke (& Washington, for that matter) ran the 3rd most Play-Action concepts last year among qualified starters. 34% of Heinicke‚Äôs drop-backs involved PA, via PFF. Last season, over 60% of Matt Corral‚Äôs drop-backs involved PA.4:33 AM ¬∑ Feb 20, 202232Taylor Heinicke (& Washington, for that matter) ran the 3rd most Play-Action concepts last year among qualified starters. 34% of Heinicke‚Äôs drop-backs involved PA, via PFF. Last season, over 60% of Matt Corral‚Äôs drop-backs involved PA. On the other hand, Washington's scheme aligns well with Corral's playing style, he has the potential to thrive running a rather simple offense with a strong emphasis on RPOs. Offensive coordinator Scott Turner can help guide Corral as he acclimatizes to the league, while also working on sharpening the tools of the young quarterback. The newly-rebranded Commanders have a strong run game that would aid a rookie quarterback, as well as a star receiver in Terry McLaurin, to make the passing game easier. Adding some more offensive skill players in free agency could certainly turn this team around.     #2 - Denver Broncos have a top NFL roster without a top quarterback Denver Broncos v Los Angeles Chargers - QB Drew Lock The Denver Broncos are filled with talent on both sides of the ball, but their talent is being wasted without a quality quarterback under center. Neither Teddy Bridgewater nor Drew Lock is the future of this NFL franchise. New head coach Nathaniel Hackett has worked closely with reigning NFL MVP quarterback Aaron Rodgers and could work his magic on Corral next.

If the Broncos do indeed draft him, the offense around Corrall would be just as young and as hungry as he is. Which could see the team making a statement in 2022 or 2023 as the Cincinnati Bengals did in 2021. #3 - New Orleans Saints need to start one quarterback in 2022 instead of four different ones     New Orleans Saints QBs - #15 Trevor Siemian and #7 Taysom Hill The New Orleans Saints started four different quarterbacks in 2021 and still couldn't find a long-term answer at the position. Jameis Winston started the season as the #1 quarterback but suffered a torn ACL as well as an injured MCL. Trevor Siemian had a decent run as a starter but showed once again that he is better suited to being an NFL backup. Taysom Hill remains an all-purpose athlete with no sole purpose on the roster and Ian Book floundered in his sole start as a rookie. Matt Corral could be the answer to solving the quarterback issues in New Orleans.

The franchise has suffered a lot of turmoil as of late and needs to start building around one quarterback, not two or three. Jameis Winston could be brought back on a cheap one-year deal to start in 2022 as Corral learns the ropes behind him. #4 - Philadelphia Eagles have too much draft capital to not take Matt Corral     NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Philadelphia Eagles v Tampa Bay Buccaneers - QB Jalen Hurts The Philadelphia Eagles have three picks in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft: #15, #16, and #19. Quarterback Jalen Hurts played admirably across 15 games, passing for 3,144 yards on 16 touchdowns and nine interceptions. This was in addition to 784 rushing yards for a further 10 touchdowns. Hurts simply doesn't look like he's on his way to becoming a dominant passer in the league and was barely able to get his team above .500 (they finished 9-8) Miles Banders@ThatboylightMatt Corral your future Philadelphia Eagles quarterback ü§ù8:02 AM ¬∑ Oct 24, 2021177Matt Corral your future Philadelphia Eagles quarterback ü§ù https://t.co/67tFFpez1b     Philadelphia has major needs such as an edge-rusher, safety, and receiver and could use their first two picks to attempt to address those issues. But passing on several of the best quarterbacks in the draft class twice isn't ideal when you don't have a promising future with your current quarterback. Corral is also a dual-threat quarterback but possesses a slightly better arm than Hurts. The NFC East is in the midst of a power shift and the Eagles could capitalize in a big way with an upgrade at quarterback. #5 - New York Giants take Corral in a heart beat if he falls to Round 2 in NFL Draft Philadelphia Eagles v New York Giants - #8 QB Daniel Jones     There is no guarantee that Matt Corral will get drafted in the first round. Following the NFL Combine, Pro Days and interviews, there's a chance he could go unpicked throughout the first round. His limited leadership experience and ball security issues could easily see him slide down into the second round. If he is still on the board, then the New York Giants should pull the trigger at pick No.36. Owen Kidd@OKiddVTWhat I‚Äôve read about Matt Corral: He has the tools to be a Lamar Jackson/Trey Lance/Josh Allen-type quarterback but he's still incredibly raw and will likely need some time to grow into the starting role at the next level. Would you still want to draft him high 1st round?6:31 AM ¬∑ Oct 25, 202131What I‚Äôve read about Matt Corral: He has the tools to be a Lamar Jackson/Trey Lance/Josh Allen-type quarterback but he's still incredibly raw and will likely need some time to grow into the starting role at the next level. Would you still want to draft him high 1st round? New head coach Brian Daboll did wonders with Josh Allen in Buffalo and Corral has been compared to Allen in terms of his mobility and arm strength. Daboll hasn't committed to Daniel Jones and may want to bring in some strong competition to test the limits of his current starter. The scheme fits and Corral is too good to pass on should he fall to the second round, despite his flaws.

4,Case Keenum,"[""Case Keenum Career: A look at the QB's journey so far  The Cleveland Browns named veteran quarterback Case Keenum as their starting quarterback for their Thursday Night Football clash against the Denver Broncos.  Those who have followed the NFL closely over the last ten years are well aware of Case Keenum. But for those who don't keep tabs on every player in the league and are wondering who Case Keenum is, here's a look at his football journey so far.        Where did Case Keenum go to college?           Case Keenum played five years in college for the Houston Cougars. Keenum, a prolific passer, eclipsed 40 touchdowns in three of the five years he spent with the team. His freshman year and his junior year were the only years he didn't pass for at least 40 touchdowns. Tom Withers@twithersAPCase Keenum: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready for this. I‚Äôm built for this.‚Äù#Browns10:08 AM ¬∑ Oct 20, 2021343 His best season was his final year. In 2011, Keenum threw for 48 touchdowns and five interceptions, while completing 71% of his pass attempts. These were all career-high numbers and set him up nicely for the NFL Draft, or so many thought. He ended up slipping through every round and didn't have a team at the end of Day 3, going undrafted.     Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterBrowns announce QB Case Keenum will start versus Broncos.7:36 AM ¬∑ Oct 20, 2021156011294 Who has Case Keenum played for in the NFL? Case Keenum has played for six teams since entering the league in 2013. His first year in the NFL was with the Houston Texans, who were enjoying a run with Matt Schaub. The Texans went 22-10 from 2011-2012. Keenum's role was mostly passive, but he did play enough to throw for 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions in those two years.         Keenum's performances were not exceptional, but they were good enough to land him with the struggling St. Louis Rams. The team essentially lost at quarterback. Keenum and Nick Foles alternated time on the field before Jared Goff ultimately stole the job. Post that, the Rams moved on from Keenum. He threw 13 touchdowns and 12 interceptions between 2015 and 2016. Keenum then landed with the Minnesota Vikings, which ended up being the most successful stint of his career. Despite being only a year long, his time with the Vikings was massive for Keenum's career. He took over mid-way through the season after Sam Bradford went down with an injury. In 14 starts, Keenum went 11-3 while throwing 22 touchdowns and seven interceptions.     The Vikings eventually made the playoffs, where Keenum played a defining role in one of the greatest playoff moments in NFL history, sending their careers to the next level. Keenum moved on from the Vikings, who signed Kirk Cousins, and landed with the Denver Broncos. The team had big hopes for Keenum, but it didn't work out. The Broncos went 6-10 that season, with Keenum throwing for 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. After a disappointing season, the Broncos moved on from Keenum. Keenum then spent time with the Washington Football Team, where he went 1-7 in eight starts and threw for 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He was then picked up by the Browns as the backup to Baker Mayfield.With Mayfield out due to injury, Keenum has a chance to show that he can play at the same level that he did during his time with the Vikings.Will Keenum see a resurgence, or will this be the final confirmation that his time with the Vikings was a fluke?

D'Ernest Johnson and Christian Kirk  It's that time of the week where you look at your fantasy football lineup and identify what areas to strengthen through the waiver wire.

If your roster has been hit by an injury bug and you are looking for replacements, here are five players to target on the waiver wire:        Top Five Fantasy football Week 7 Waiver Wire Pickups           #1 - D'Ernest Johnson, RB, Cleveland Browns Camryn Justice@camijustice#Browns are thin at running back but D'Ernest Johnson and John Kelly are getting in work with Johnny Stanton today.2:23 AM ¬∑ Oct 19, 2021273 Nick Chubb was ruled out for Week 6 and Kareem Hunt ended up with a severe calf injury, leaving the Cleveland Browns thin in the backfield. D'Ernest Johnson and Demetric Felton will see larger roles in Week 7, but Johnson is a better waiver wire pickup in fantasy football.

Kirk has been a consistent starter and has scored more than 10 points in the past two games. The Arizona Cardinals have a favorable matchup next week as they take on the Houston Texans. Kirk will likely score plenty of fantasy points. #3 - Case Keenum, QB, Cleveland Browns     Fred Greetham@FredGreetham9#Browns Case Keenum and Nick Mullens the only 2 on the field during the open part of practice at QB. Baker Mayfield was not seen on the field.1:57 AM ¬∑ Oct 19, 2021 Even if Case Keenum doesn't start Week 7, it is wise to pick him up off waivers this week. Baker Mayfield is playing through a dislocated shoulder, but he may not be able to play through the pain all year. It's still not 100% certain that Mayfield will play on Thursday, and Keenum will be stepping up if needed. Keenum is a solid fantasy football option at QB2. #4 - Rhamondre Stevenson, RB, New England Patriots Sooner Gridiron@soonergridironCongrats to Rhamondre Stevenson on his first NFL touchdown.#OUDNA x @dreeday32 7:08 AM ¬∑ Oct 17, 202198950     Rhamondre Stevenson scored his first NFL touchdown against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 6 and is seeing a steady role as a pass-catcher. Damien Harris could be limited by an ankle injury and Stevenson is proving to be a reliable option in the backfield. Fifteen fantasy football points against Dallas is a fantastic performance and the Patriots face the New York Jets in Week 7. Stevenson could have an even better outing against the Jets. #5 -Tua Tagovailoa, QB, Miami Dolphins Chris Kouffman@ckparrotTua Tagovailoa in the 4th Quarter:63 of 81 (78%) for 626 yards (7.7 ypa), 5 TD, 2 INT3 Sacks (-20 yd), 9 runs for 41 yards, 3 rush TD109 passer rating.10:29 AM ¬∑ Oct 19, 2021697115     Tua Tagovailoa returned from his rib injury to face the Jacksonville Jaguars in London.

In under two weeks, the team could be 3-5 and without a starting quarterback. At a certain point, the writing is on the wall and the team needs to make some decisions about the future. If Mayfield is still hurt or the team simply isn\'t winning, it might make sense to trade away some players to get ready for next season.  At the same time, if the team is instead 5-3 and still alive, they could also be inclined to make some last-minute moves to bolster the roster before the trade deadline becomes official on Tuesday, November 2. Either way, the Browns could be in for an explosive start to November. Here\'s a look at two players the Browns could trade away and one they could add.        NFL trade deadline 2021: Browns building or Browns auctioning?           #1 - Browns trade away Odell Beckham Jr. The Browns may trade Odell Beckham Jr. away if they don\'t round a corner in the next ten days. Beckham has been injury-prone and is about to turn 30 years old. Next season, the Browns will be on the hook for about $15 million, according to Spotrac. Would it be worth keeping him around at that price?

After the season, teams will not be in the heat of the moment and will not be interested in trading more than the least amount possible. In the middle of the season, desperation trumps frugality. Barring a miracle, this will be the second season in a row in which Beckham has not reached 1000-yards. At some point, the writing is on the wall and moves need to be made.

Keenum\'s stock will be at a high and the Browns have Nick Mullens on the roster as well. If the Browns could trade Keenum for one more star, it could be the final piece.     Put simply, with all of the injuries on the roster at the moment, trading Keenum for a star could be the Browns\' biggest move they can make to attempt to stem the tide. It would be a fight back against the injury bug that has currently infested the team.     #3 - Browns trade for DeVante Parker With so much instability out wide for the 2021 Cleveland Browns, adding another face could be a much-needed dose of medicine. DeVante Parker could be just what the doctor ordered. The Dolphins are 1-5 and just gave up a win against the Jacksonville Jaguars. It cannot be any more obvious that their season is over. Thus, they should be evaluating all of their assets, including DeVante Parker. Parker played with Jarvis Landry in Miami. Having a reunion in Cleveland could do wonders for morale out wide and it could help get Parker up to speed quickly. Parker is still playing well enough to be a big help for the Browns. Last week, he had four catches for 77 yards and a touchdown. Of course, after such a performance so recently, Parker wouldn\'t be the cheapest move. Miami Dolphins Training Camp In this scenario, however, the Browns are 4-4 or better and still in the wild-card chase. They could feel that they need some extra juice and are just one player away from making the playoffs for the second year in a row. This would also be the first time since the 1980s. Parker could be that player for the team.     ', ""Stetson Bennett to go undrafted in the 2023 NFL Draft? Executive gives clarity on teams' apprehension  An anonymous executive shared with ESPN‚Äôs Jeremy Fowler that quarterback Stetson Bennett might not hear his name called during the 2023 NFL Draft. The executive said:  ‚ÄúTo me, he‚Äôs clearly better than those other guys [in this tier]. He does some good stuff. But he might go undrafted. His pre-draft hasn't been good, and there are questions about whether he‚Äôll be the pro that you need out of a backup QB.‚Äù        In Fowler‚Äôs article, NFL executives and scouts categorized 13 quarterback prospects into tiers. The former Georgia play-caller is in Tier 4, the lowest of all groups, with Stanford‚Äôs Tanner McKee and TCU‚Äôs Max Duggan.           The 25-year-old play-caller does have an impressive resume after playing four seasons with the Georgia Bulldogs. He helped the squad to consecutive national championships, tallying 528 yards and eight touchdowns in those games. Those numbers earned him two national championship offensive MVP honors and made him only the fifth quarterback to win consecutive national championships.

He also received last year‚Äôs Burlsworth Trophy as the best Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) player to start as a walk-on. Bennett also took home the 2022 Manning Award as college football‚Äôs best quarterback, as per the Sugar Bowl committee. Fowler compared Stetson Bennett to Houston Texans quarterback Case Keenum. While the executive sees him becoming undrafted, he could go off the board early in the draft‚Äôs third day (rounds four to seven). Meanwhile, an NFL coordinator praised Bennett by saying: ‚ÄúPlays big in big games, quick-twitch, aggressive -- sometimes that hurts him, but he has confidence, which is what you want.‚Äù  Stetson Bennett addressed his recent arrest In late January, WFAA-TV‚Äôs Rebecca Lopez reported that Stetson Bennett was arrested on suspicion of public intoxication. Officers were dispatched when he banged on doors in an Old East Dallas neighborhood as early as 6 a.m. He was taken to a detention center upon his arrest.     Sports Illustrated‚Äôs Mike McDaniel shared that Bennett addressed the matter during the Scouting Combine last month. He told media members: ‚ÄúIt was a mistake that, you know, everyone is aware of.

I‚Äôve talked to GMs and apologized to my family because that‚Äôs whom I felt worst about.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúI felt like I let them down because no matter where I go now, and even without all this, I‚Äôve got an obligation.

"", ""NFL 2018: Ranking the new QB situations for 2018 season  The 2018 off-season began even before the Super Bowl 52 was played. The Washington Redskins agreed to trade for quarterback Alex Smith from the Kansas City Chiefs in late January thus resetting the QB market even before the season ended. Two teams already had two new quarterbacks before the Eagles could beat out the defending champions in February.  The trade freed the embattled ex-Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins to sign with the Minnesota Vikings in Free agency. The Vikings, who made it to the NFC Championship game, had three starting-caliber quarterbacks and let them all hit the free agency and signed Cousins to a first-ever full guaranteed contract.        Weeks prior to the start of free agency it was obvious that the Cousins-Vikings marriage is inevitable, which prompted the MVP of Vikings season Case Keenum to struck a deal with Denver Broncos even before the Cousins deal was finalized. This Keenum deal started the domino effect with many teams that are in the QB market started making deals.           Cleveland Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor from the Buffalo Bills, one of many trades they made this offseason. Arizona Cardinals signed Sam Bradford, New York Jets Signed Teddy Bridgewater and then traded him to the New Orleans Saints after an amazing preseason. AJ McCarron signed with the Bills and got beat out by rookie Josh Allen to become the starter which prompted the Bills to trade him to Oakland. Speaking of rookies, the 2018 draft had as many as Five QBs taken in round 1. By Week 4, four of the 5 are starting and the fifth QB is already seeing some game action in trick plays.     Including both the Veterans and Rookies, there are as many as Eight teams who had new Quarterbacks starting for them this year. Let's take a look at how these QBs fared so far with their new teams. Let's start with a Bonus player, the man who took the league by surprise and then crash landed in week 4:  BONUS: Ryan Fitzpatrick (2-2)  Oh, where to start. When I first started to think about this article after week 2, I had him competing for the number 1 spot with the current number 1 and then week 4 happened and the head coach Dirk Koetter has announced that Jameis Winston will be starting after the week 5 bye.     Since, FitzMagic is just a placeholder for Winston, who was serving his 3-game suspension, I decided not to include him in the rankings but thought he deserved a shout-out for his performance through the first three weeks. He went 2-2 in his starts when no one expected him to be anything better than 1-3. He faced three playoff teams from last year and went 2-1 in those games and came close to being 3-0 while trying to make an epic comeback against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 3. He posted 400 yards in each of his first three games, an NFL record. But week 4 proved why Fitzpatrick is who he is, a journeyman quarterback. The four-game stretch should help him get more money in the next offseason and will be a highly paid backup QB. #8 Josh Rosen/Sam Bradford, Arizona Cardinals (0-4)      Two teams have already started two quarterbacks who were not on their roster last season, one of them is Arizona Cardinals. Cardinals, who saw both their quarterback and head coach retire after last season had a complete overhaul in coaching and QB room. The added three quarterbacks including Mike Glennon. Sam Bradford, who is coming off injuries, signed a 1 year 20 million dollar contract and became a presumed starter. But, the Cardinals are off to a terrible start losing out in all the three starts prompting the change to go with the rookie Josh Rosen. Bradford in his three starts completed 62.5% of his passes for 400 yards and two touchdowns. But, he also had four INTs to his name. Bradford, couldn't move the ball well under Mike McCoy's game plan. He struggled in the first 2 games where the offense only scored 6 points in total. He started off well in the Week 3 matchup against the Chicago Bears where he tossed two TDs to start the game, but then couldn't find the momentum in the rest of the game which paved the way for the rookies Josh Rosen to come in the fourth quarter and try to win the game which was a very close contest.         Rosen was named starter for week 4 and quietly had an impressive debut. Rosen probably threw for only 180 yards but kept the Cardinals in the game without making any stupid mistakes. Cardinals eventually lost to the Russell Wilson's Seahawks, but had a glimpse of their bright future. The Cardinals running game needs to be picked up. The O-line has been one of the worst in the league, which handcuffed one of the elite tailbacks in David Johnson.     This Cardinals offense reminds me of 2016 Rams team which made Todd Gurley, Jared Goff and Case Keenum do nothing. This Cardinals offense is doing the same to David Johnson, Josh Rosen and Larry Fitzerald. Look for a coaching change to come this off season even though it is the first season as a head coach for Steve Wilks, at the very least the OC needs to be changed. With the correct play caller, this offense is capable of some high flying action ala Chiefs, Rams and the Texans. #7 Josh Allen/Nathan Peterman, Buffalo Bills (1-3)      Buffalo Bills had one of the strangest QB competition in NFL this offseason. They had three quarterbacks in the battle for the starting spot during the training camp. All thought that it would be AJ McCarron but instead as the preseason approached McCarron became third stringer and expendable, thus his trade to Raiders. The Bill surprisingly announced Nathan Peterman over the rookie Josh Allen as the starter for week 1, but Peterman repeated his first start performance from last year when he threw for 5 picks. He threw 2 picks and scored nothing, which led for the rookie Josh Allen to take the reigns. Allen in his three starts the next three weeks, completed only 53.4% of passes throwing just two touchdowns with four picks. His best game came in week 3 when the Buffalo Bills stunned the world by beating the Minnesota Vikings. Allen had three total TDs, 2 of them coming on the ground, showing off his athleticism in that game. But, he came back to earth in week 4, throwing 2 picks against an average Packers defense.     Allen, as expected, is raw and playing like a typical rookie. In an ideal scenario, he could use a redshirt season before taking over the reigns like Patrick Mahomes, but he did not have the luxury of learning under someone like Alex Smith, instead, the situation has thrust him into starting role early. He is going to have some growing pains but if week 3 is any indication he is going to be big in long term. #6 Baker Mayfield/Tyrod Taylor, Cleveland Browns (1-2-1)      This is the second team in the list that already had two starters who were not on the roster last season. The Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor during the offseason. A month later the Browns picked Baker Mayfield with the number 1 overall pick. Mayfield was supposed to be redshirted this season with Taylor holding the place for the year at least until the Browns are out of Playoff contention. But with Taylor's concussion in Week 3 Thursday Night matchup against the Jets, Mayfield came in late second quarter and helped Browns mount the comeback and give the franchise its first win in 17 games. Browns had a great start to the season, mostly thanks to the defense which stifled Ben Roethlisberger in Week 1. Drew Brees also had a tough time playing against this defense. Browns started 0-1-1 in the first two weeks and entered week 3 as favorites for the first time in almost two seasons.     Tyrod Taylor apart from a couple of plays had a tough start to his Browns tenure. That bad form continued in week 3. The first half of that game was unwatchable with Tyrod under center. But, when Mayfield came into the game, the dynamics changed. Browns offense is fun to watch after a very long time, He made the plays that Tyrod Taylor would hesitate to do.     Mayfield brought the life back into the Browns fans. The stadium was lit during the Second Half. That Second Half started a new era in Cleveland Football History. Mayfield was named a starter for Week 4 and beyond as expected. On his first start though Mayfield came back to earth against the Oakland Raiders.     Mayfield threw for two touchdowns but also had four turnovers which resulted in 21 Raiders points. Mayfield showed off his athletic skills, but also showed it was premature to make him a HOF player after that amazing second half in week 3. It is going to be interesting to see how the Browns and Mayfield will continue the rest of the way in all of a sudden new look AFC North that has Steelers tied at the bottom of the table instead of the top. #5 Sam Darnold, New York Jets (1-3)      Darnold was the only rookie quarterback who was named the starting quarterback prior to week 1. He had to earn the job in a battle with Teddy Bridgewater. Both Darnold and Bridgewater had a good preseason leading the Jets to trade Bridgewater to Saints and announce Darnold as a starter. Unlike other rookies, Darnold had an impressive start to his career. He completed 76% of his passes for 198 yards, 2 TDs and a pick with an impressive 116.8 rating. But after that, he came back crashing to earth. He had 4 more INTs to only 2 TDs in the remaining three games.         Darnold had his first career game without any interception in week 4 against a very good Jacksonville Jaguars defense. That should be considered a minor victory for a rookie QB who is struggling after a strong start. Unlike other quarterbacks, Darnold isn't surrounded by high flying talent. His receivers and the running backs are well below league average. In order to succeed long-term, the Jets need to provide weapons around him as the Bears did with Mitchell Trubisky this year, which helped him go off in week 4. Quincy Enunwa and the receivers need to step up and help the rookie QB to have any shot this year. Patriots, who had a slow start are getting back their groove right in time with Julian Edelman returning from his suspension. Jets will be facing a tough Denver defense in week 5. if Darnold could escape that game without a Turnover, they could have a very good chance to escape with a W. He could take some pointer from his veteran backup and mentor Josh McCown.     #4 Alex Smith, Washington Redskins (2-1)  Alex Smith has been his typical self to start the 2018 season with his new team the Washington Redskins. He has a completed nearly 70% of his passes and scored 4 Touchdowns with a pick and a 2-1 record. That is a typical Alex Smith stat line. Smith had a good start for his redskins tenure against the Cardinals, where he threw for 255 yards and a couple of TDs. But, in week 2 against a mediocre Colts defense Smith couldn't find the endzone even though completing nearly 72% of his passes. He and the Redskins bounced back in week 3 against the Packers where he outplayed Rodgers to upset the Packers.     Smith success correlates with the success of the running game. in the two wins, the Redskins new running back, Adrian Peterson rushed for nearly hundred yards and has scored a TD at least once, in the loss against the Colts he rushed 11 times for just 20 yards. Smith is one of those QBs who needs all the dominoes around him should work efficiently to find the success. He does not commit any back-breaking mistakes but he does not even get you out of the gate if fallen behind. NFC East is vulnerable right now and Redskins sit on top of the division even with their bye on week 4. The one difference between the Chiefs and the Redskins is that they lack that dynamic pass catcher that could help a QB out. Jordan Reed had some success in the wins but Jamison Crowder has yet to find the rhythm. It will be interesting to see if Smith can help out the Redskins to remain on top of a very close NFC East race as he did with the Chiefs the past few Seasons.     #3 Case Keenum, Denver Broncos (2-2)  Case Keenum, an undrafted free agent out of the University of Houston, had one of the most unprecedented journeys to become the starting quarterback of Denver Broncos. After his amazing career year in 2017 with the Vikings, Keenum signed a 2 year 36 million dollar contract with the Broncos. But, so far Keenum was not able to replicate the kind of success he had last season. Keenum had a total of 7 INTs in 2017 season has already thrown for 6 so far in four games and just tossing three touchdowns. Keenum's decision making at times seem erratic. He is trying to do more than what the defenses are giving him.     Even with his erratic play Keenum found some early success in the first two weeks by having two clutch game winning drives, which Broncos did not have last season. He almost had a third game winning drive on the MNF, week 4 against the Chiefs. He overthrew a wide open Demaryius Thomas which could have resulted in a game winning TD. In the next play he did connect to the rookie Courtland Sutton in an old-school hook and ladder play call.         Keenum, just like Smith is a game manager who needs to have a better player all around him. He has a solid running game with the two rookies, Royce Freeman and Phillip Lindsay sharing the work load, but the receivers apart from Emmanuel Sanders haven't really stepped up. The reason for having Keenum just a tick above the Last year with Vikings Keenum had Thielen and Diggs who had some amazing catches that helped out Keenum. Keenum knows that Demaryius Thomas is no longer in that elite group and need to be more careful forcing the ball into the tight coverage. The reason I have Keenum a tick above Alex Smith is that of his Clutch performance in weeks 1 and 2 and his NFC Championship game appearance just a few months back. I still think that Keenum is an upgrade to what Denver had last season and could help them have a fighting chance to at least grab the Wildcard spot in the playoffs.     There is no panic yet in Denver, there is a lot of season left and with no viable back up option left this will be Keenum's Season. If he can clean up the turnovers, this Denver team could be in hunt for a playoff spot in December. #2 Kirk Cousins, Minnesota Vikings (1-2-1)  Kirk Cousins, signed a monster contract with the Minnesota Vikings this offseason. After reaching the NFC Championship game a year ago with Keenum under center, the expectations very sky high for the Vikings fans. Some even considered this a Superbowl or bust move.     If indeed it is a Superbowl or bust move, the Vikings are off to a terrible start. They opened the season with a W against the 49ers but tied it up in week 2 with the Packers thanks to some head-scratching roughing the passer penalties. But the real stunner cam in Week 3 when Vikings and Cousins looked almost clueless against a bad Buffalo Bills team who scored a combined 23 points in the remaining three games. Cousins was shutout for three quarters, he had a couple of strip sacks an INT and it was late in the 4Q that he tossed a TD almost in garbage time. Apart from that one week, Cousins was his usual self he completed nearly 70% of his passes, tossing 10 Touchdowns and just 2 picks. He has 1,387 yards in just 4 games and yet the record is 1-2-1 record.         Cousins tenure so far remained same like his Redskins tenure where he played very well when was not pressured too much. But, when pressured his performance goes down. In 2018 so far his rating when the pocket is clean was 112.2, but when he is pressured it dramatically drops down to 89.8. Cousins even brought his fumbling issue from Redskins to Vikings, in which he is second most to fumble the ball since 2015. The Vikings O-line performance has been masked by Keenum's athleticism last season of avoiding the sacks, which Cousins clearly lacks. If Vikings need to find success with Cousins under center they need to provide a clean pocket and give him time to make the plays that Keenum couldn't have done last season. The NFC North looks very interesting with Chicago Bears on Top with Packer right next to them. If the Vikings need to be in the Playoffs in a very tough NFC they need to keep teh pocket clean for Cousins.     #1 Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs (4-0)  Patrick Mahomes is not a new player that was signed or added this offseason but he is the new starter for the Kansas City Chiefs after they traded Alex Smith to the Redskins. Mahomes did start in week 17 of last season but still, this is the first season as a full-fledged starter and thought he should be in this conversation. After the kind of start he had, he certainly should be.     Mahomes had one of the best starts since the Peyton Manning's record-breaking 2013 season. Mahomes even broke the Manning's record of 12 total touchdowns by tossing 13 through weeks 1-3. During the first three weeks, Mahomes was off to fast starts putting up 20+ points to start the game and make the opposing offenses play catchup to the Chiefs. The real test for Mahomes came in week 4 against a very good Broncos defense in a very rowdy Denver environment in Monday Night Prime-time slot. He had a slow start where Denver's defense had his number during the first three quarters. But he remained calm and made some timely passes in the fourth quarter resulting in one of the most thrilling matches in 2018 season so far.         The most amazing fact about Mahomes' performance so far in 2018 is that he has yet to throw an interception. In his four starts this season he has 15 touchdowns and zero picks. This INT-less streak should be attributed to his redshirt year in 2017 under Alex Smith. There is no better player to learn from how to remain interception-free. Mahomes performance so far is a reminiscence of Deshaun Watson's performance for Houston Texans last season. Mahomes is bound to be regressed in coming weeks, which could happen very well in week 5 against a very strong Jaguars defense, who allowed only a total of 4 touchdowns. The sky is the limit for Mahomes and this Kansas City offense. All they could ask for is the defense to play some average level play who currently are last in passing yards allowed. If the defense is not improved, a very good offensive season could very well be ruined come January. Mahomes, distanced himself from others atop of the MVP race, not a bad way to kickoff your first full season as a starting NFL QB. Let's hope the football gods spare Mahomes that bit the likes of Wentz and Watson last season during their own MVP campaigns.

He was named the starting running back after both Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt were ruled out for the game. Johnson helped back up quarterback Case Keenum and the Browns to a much-needed victory.  Cleveland entered the game having lost two in a row and were falling behind in the AFC North standings. They were facing a tough Broncos defense while missing key starters. D'Ernest Johnson earned the first start of his career and rushed for 146 yards and a touchdown. He was the Player of the Game in the Browns' 17-14 victory.        The Browns are unlikely to miss Chubb and Hunt thanks to D'Ernest Johnson           D'Ernest Johnson helped the Browns continue with their dominant rushing attack. Every week Cleveland utilize both Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt to overwhelm defenses on their way to one of the very best rushing offenses in the NFL. Neither was able to play on Thursday but the numbers really didn't change much with their third stringer, D'Ernest Johnson, getting the start. NFL on CBS üèà@NFLonCBS‚ÄúPlaying in the NFL was always my dream ‚Ä¶ Coming where I come from, it‚Äôs a blessing man. ‚Äù - D‚ÄôErnest Johnson11:29 AM ¬∑ Oct 21, 20211873106     D'Ernest Johnson is now the third Browns running back to account for 100 yards in a game. That is the most in the NFL, with five teams having zero running backs who have achieved that accomplishment in a single game this season. D'Ernest Johnson helped the Browns possess the ball for more than 60 percent of the game clock and 13 minutes more than the Broncos. This is the Browns' winning formula. D'Ernest Johnson's path to the NFL D'Ernest Johnson was an absolute superstar at the University of South Florida. He had an excellent college football career for them as a running back. Johnson set a school record with 4,186 all-purpose yards and is one of the best USF players of all time. Unfortunately, he was not picked by any team in the NFL Draft. However, D'Ernest Johnson was not done yet trying to make it as a professional football player. In 2018 he went on social media and sent direct messages to all of the teams in the Alliance of American Football asking them for a tryout. His determination landed him a roster spot on the Orlando Apollos. He was successful with the team until the AAF league folded and he was left without a football home once again.     B/R Gridiron@brgridironIn 2018, D'Ernest Johnson messaged every AAF team requesting a tryout. D‚ÄôErnest last night in his first NFL career start:- 22 carries- 146 rushing yards- 22 receiving yards- 1 TD(via @courtkramer39)9:38 AM ¬∑ Oct 22, 2021216721669 In 2019 he got the call he really wanted and was signed to an NFL team, the Cleveland Browns. Thursday night against the Broncos, all of his hard work and determination paid off. D'Ernest Johnson finally got his chance to start a game in the NFL and he made the most of it. It was a memorable performance to cap off an amazing journey.     "", ""NFL 2018: Top 12 0.5 PPR NFL Fantasy Wide Receivers  Wide Receivers are vital in PPR leagues for obvious reasons. Their catching! If you didn't know, PPR stands for 'Point per Reception'. Here I take a look at my top 12 ranked receivers for the coming season.          #12. TY Hilton - Indianapolis Colts - 2017 total = 147.1           Houston Texans v Indianapolis Colts Now this pick could easily change, the closer we get to the NFL season. It all depends on Andrew Lucks' health and if he will be ready to play football at the beginning of the season. Last season, was a down season for Hilton. His 966 receiving yards were the fewest he's had in a season since his rookie year, and way down on the previous seasons total of 1448 yards, which led the league.     Hilton only caught 57 passes, which ranked at 36th among all WR's. That's not exactly the type of productivity you are expecting from the usually reliable Hilton. This was mainly due to Hilton's rapport with Jacoby Brissett being nowhere near as good as when he's paired with Luck. When he last played with Luck in the 2016 season he set a career high in receiving yards and receptions. I fully expect him to set those sorts of figures again if Andrew Luck returns. #11 Adam Thielen ‚Äì Minnesota Viking‚Äôs ‚Äì 2017 total = 194.2 Baltimore Ravens v Minnesota Vikings     2017 was a breakout year for Thielen, setting career highs in receiving yards and receptions. He overtook Stefon Diggs as the ‚Äògo to‚Äô receiver on the team and showed great rapport with Case Keenum. He caught 91 passes, for 1276 yards and 4 touchdowns as Keenum played the best football of his career. This year, it‚Äôs Kirk Cousins at the helm, which is an instant upgrade for the Minnesota offense. Will he have the same rapport with Thielen as Keenum did? I think he will. He‚Äôs a franchise Quarterback who can get it done week in week out. It will be interesting to see how long it takes that connection to flourish. #10 Michael Thomas ‚Äì New Orleans Saints ‚Äì 2017 total = 203.5 New Orleans Saints v Carolina Panthers     Thomas quietly had a very strong 2017 season. In his sophomore year, he caught 104 passes, which was the third most in the league. It was a productive season for the wideout, despite the Saints going with a run-heavy approach to help relieve some pressure on the aging Drew Brees. That being said, the Saints re-signed Brees on a 2-year deal this offseason, showing their confidence in him to take them to a Super Bowl. Thomas is the undoubted WR1 in the offense, and he will continue to receive high volume whenever Brees looks down the field. #9 Mike Evans ‚Äì Tampa Bay Buccaneers ‚Äì 2017 total = 167. Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Carolina Panthers     Evans has all the talent in the world to be an elite receiver in this league for many years. He was a part of the famous WR group in the 2014 draft, where he was drafted with the 7th overall pick, ahead of Odell Beckham Jr. However, 2017 marked career lows for Evans in receptions and yards. This was largely down to his QB, Jameis Winston, not progressing like everyone had expected. That being said, Evans is always Winston‚Äôs first look, so hopefully, he can get back to his 2016 season form, where he caught 96 passes for 1321 yards and 12 touchdowns. #8 AJ Green ‚Äì Cincinnati Bengals ‚Äì 2017 total = 189.3 Cleveland Browns v Cincinnati Bengals     AJ Green truly is one of the best receivers in the NFL. He has put up 1000+ yard seasons in 6 out of the 7 years he has been in the league. That includes 2017, where he caught 75 passes for 1078 yards and 8 touchdowns, despite being on a poor Bengals team with some lackluster performances from Andy Dalton. The offense should be helped by the return of a healthy Tyler Eifert at Tight End and 2017 draft sensation, John Ross, getting more playing time. I see this creating more space for Green as he will face less double teams from opposing CBs. I project him having over 85 catches this coming season. #7 Larry Fitzgerald ‚Äì Arizona Cardinals ‚Äì 2017 total = 206.9 Tennessee Titans v Arizona Cardinals     The aging legend, Larry Fitzgerald, had yet another stellar season for the Arizona Cardinals. He has been such a valuable weapon for Carson Palmer over the years, and maybe none more so than this past season. Fitz caught a massive 109 passes, which was second most in the league, with only Jarvis Landry catching more. Amazingly, Jaron Brown, who had the second most receptions at WR, was miles behind with just 31 catches on the year. This shows that despite being 34 years of age, Fitzgerald is still the main cog in the Cardinals passing game. This new season will see a change of Quarterback in Arizona, with Sam Bradford being signed as a free agent, and Josh Rosen being acquired in the draft with the number 10 overall pick. Whoever is under center come game week 1, Fitzgerald with seeing his usual high volume, as he chases down Terrell Owens for number 2 on the all-time list for receiving yards.     #6 Davante Adams ‚Äì Green Bay Packers ‚Äì 2017 total = 185.5 Green Bay Packers v Carolina Panthers Adams has been fantastic for the Packers over this past couple of seasons, and this year he gets the chance to be the undoubted WR1 in the Green Bay offense. With Jordy Nelson leaving for Oakland Raiders and no veteran brought in to replace him, there will be a lot more targets up for grabs. Adams showed last year that he could get the job done even when Aaron Rodgers went down with a broken collarbone.     This year, Rodgers will be back to full health and is likely to hyper-target Adams, especially in the red zone. He has 22 touchdowns over the past two seasons, which is more than all of the players who have ranked ahead of him on this list. I see a big season ahead for the 25-year-old, former second-round pick out of Fresno State. #5 Keenan Allen ‚Äì Los Angeles Chargers ‚Äì 2017 total = 234.2 San Diego Chargers v Kansas City Chiefs Allen had a slow start to the 2017 season, but he ended up tallying the most receptions and receiving yards of his career. He showed that when he can stay healthy, he is easily a WR1 in this league. Coming off a lacerated kidney in 2015, and a torn ACL in 2016, Allen had become known as injury prone, and many had their doubts about him coming into the 2017 season.     The Chargers even drafted Mike Williams with the 7th overall pick to bolster their WR corps. Allen showed all those doubters wrong as he caught 102 passes and racked up 1393 receiving yards. I fully expect more of the same this year, as the Chargers look to be serious contenders to go far in the playoffs. #4 Julio Jones ‚Äì Atlanta Falcons ‚Äì 2017 total = 207.9 NFC Championship - Green Bay Packers v Atlanta Falcons Julio Jones is a freak athlete, with size, strength and great hands. However, last year seemed to be a bit of a disappointment for fantasy owners who had drafted him in the first round. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Jones still caught 88 passes for 1444 yards, so it was far from a poor season. His main issue was in the touchdown column.     He only caught 3 passes in the end zone, compared to totals of 8 and 10 in years gone by. This was mainly down to Matt Ryan‚Äôs inaccuracy in the RedZone. I see him improving on last years totals, with the addition of Calvin Ridley really helping. Ridley will take some of the attention away from Julio, freeing him up for more receptions and more touchdowns. #3 DeAndre Hopkins ‚Äì Houston Texans ‚Äì 2017 total = 261.8 Houston Texans v Tennessee Titans Hopkins had a fantastic 2017 season for the Texans, catching 13 touchdowns in 15 games, leading to First-team All-Pro honors. He had double-digit targets in the majority of games, regardless of the coverage assigned to him. He showed he could produce big numbers no matter who the team had at Quarterback.     Hopkins also struck up a great rapport with rookie QB Deshaun Watson before he got injured. This will give Texans fans and fantasy owners great hope going into the 2018 season. If Watson can get back to the superb form he displayed in his rookie year, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Hopkins ends up as the WR1 at the end of the season. #2 Odell Beckham Jr ‚Äì New York Giants ‚Äì 2017 total = 61.5 Dallas Cowboys v New York Giants 2017 was a bit of a write off for OBJ, as he missed the first game with an ankle injury and then suffered a fractured ankle in the week 5 match against the Chargers. In those 3 and a half games, he managed 25 catches for 302 yards and 3 touchdowns, which is a great return.     This offseason has been dominated by bad press, trade rumors, and talk of Beckham Jr wanting to be the highest paid player in the NFL. The Giants would be crazy to trade Odell away as he is on course to be one of the best receivers the league has ever seen. In his 47 career games, Beckham has 38 touchdowns and 4424 receiving yards to his name. If he carries on at that pace he will surpass some of the all-time greats and break numerous records. This season will be an interesting one for the Giants offense. The acquisition of Saquon Barkley will relieve the pressure on Eli Manning and is likely to free up more space for the receivers to take full advantage. I see another huge season for Odell, as long as he can stay out of trouble. #1 Antonio Brown ‚Äì Pittsburgh Steelers ‚Äì 2017 total = 259.8 Indianapolis Colts v Pittsburgh Steelers     What a season it was for the Antonio Brown, as he cemented his place as the best wide receiver in the league. Brown caught 101 passes for a league-leading 1533 yards, and 9 touchdowns. He is so crucial to the Steelers offense, getting separation from defender‚Äôs time and time again. Given his relatively diminutive size, Brown has proved that you don‚Äôt need to be over 6 feet tall to be a success in the NFL. He has made every team that passed on him in the 2010 Draft pay, as he continues to put up big numbers year after year. The former 6th round and 195th overall pick will be a top 6-7 pick in all Fantasy drafts this coming year.

Quarterbacking one of the most overlooked franchises in the NFL isn't easy, with every defeat further knocking a fragile confidence.  The Houston Texans finished the 2022 season with an almost inexplicable victory over the Indianapolis Colts. It was a win that cost them the first-overall pick in the 2023 draft. While the Chicago Bears were doubtless the real winners of that crazy AFC South showdown, Davis Mills may also benefit.        The Bears will likely trade the number-one pick for as much as they can get, as they will almost certainly go forward with Justin Fields under center. The Texans, however, are looking to the draft for a new quarterback. While Houston could send draft capital to Chicago for pole position, this feels unlikely.           As does trading for Lamar Jackson or Aaron Rodgers and going for Jimmy Garoppolo doesn't make total sense. These are targets for teams that are looking to win now and the Texans are rebuilding. Drew@IndepthTexansThe Houston Texans have now met with all of the 4 top QB‚Äôs in the NFL Draft:‚Ä¢Bryce Young ‚Ä¢C.J Stroud ‚Ä¢Anthony Richardson ‚Ä¢Will LevisVery likely one of these 4 will be the Texans next QB and or selection with the number 2 overall pick in the draft23322     Whoever does get the first-overall pick is expected to take Bryce Young, which suggests CJ Stroud will become a Texan. Regardless of which QB they draft, this is bad news for Davis Mills. However, he may yet get another chance to prove himself. Bringing in a rookie QB is highly unlikely to turn Houston into immediate Super Bowl contenders, for there are needs to address throughout their roster. With a new head coach and plenty of decent picks, they will be an interesting team to watch. But chucking a rookie quarterback into the fray could do more harm than good. Blooding the rookies throughout their rebuilding roster will be a must, but being careful with their biggest investment is key. Mills was sacked 31 times in each of his two campaigns, and the franchise will test its offensive line before throwing a new man into the mix. The Texans would be wise to tread carefully with their rookie's confidence. There's a fine line between learning from your mistakes and developing a complex. Many a QB has been ruined by a losing side and Houston will measure their new man's mettle carefully.        As such, don't be surprised if the Texans take their time introducing a new man under center and we may see Mills start the season. There is certainly precedence for patience with rookies, as seen by multiple quarterbacks currently in the league.  Rookie quarterbacks often sit behind veterans Los Angeles Rams v New York Giants     Obviously, not every player will see the success of Patrick Mahomes, who sat behind Alex Smith for his first campaign. Nor will the new Texans QB necessarily turn into Aaron Rodgers, who was Brett Favre's understudy (not exactly willingly by either player) for years. Kenny Pickett had to wait for his chance behind Mitch Trubisky for the Pittsburgh Steelers, as did Malik Willis and Desmond Ridder (Tennessee Titans and Atlanta Falcons, respectively). Jared Goff didn't make an appearance for the Los Angeles Rams until the franchise lost patience with Case Keenum midway through the 2016 season. Trey Lance also sat a season behind Jimmy Garoppolo. The point here is that there is a good chance Houston will give Davis Mills opportunities this season. They may want to let their rookie find his feet in the NFL before naming him the starter, or ensure his head doesn't drop if things go wrong. Looking at the last two seasons, Davis Mills is well worth keeping around for the Texans, especially on his rookie deal.      Davis Mills might not resurrect the Texans, but he can help them through a transitional phase Davis Mills - Philadelphia Eagles v Houston Texans Houston have struggled for multiple seasons, with their last playoff appearance coming in the 2019 campaign. Deshaun Watson recorded an individually memorable 2020 campaign, but the Texans finished 4-12. With Watson sitting out a season before being traded to Cleveland, Houston had a gap to fill at quarterback.     Davis Mills was drafted by the franchise in the third round in 2021 behind several quarterbacks. This list includes Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson, Trey Lance, Justin Fields, Mac Jones, Kyle Trask, and Kellen Mond. Mills was taken 67th and not a whole lot was expected of him or the Texans. In his rookie season, he was something of a surprise package. Mills started the campaign behind Tyrod Taylor before taking the starting role (after an injury and some poor play by Taylor). Mills threw for a respectable 2,664 yards and 16 touchdowns against 10 interceptions. He went for a disappointing 2-9 as a starter, but given how low expectations were for him and the Texans, Mills was given quite a lot of credit. In the last campaign, Davis Mills threw for 3,118 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. There were concerns with his play and analysts were reluctant to give him a pass this time. Talks that maybe Mills could be the man under center long-term stopped, and as the losses piled up, people started to look to the 2023 draft.     That said, Mills had some decent highlights last season, especially in both games against the Colts. Quarterbacking the Texans was a thankless task in the 2022 campaign, and it could have gone a lot worse. # 2 Pick In Draft@AYOTexanNationSome Big boy throws from Davis Mills week 1 vs Colts ! 23-37 / 240 Yards/ 2TD 0ints / 98.9 PRLeft some plays out there but all in all had a solid game #WeAreTexans17729 Davis Mills could be very useful in getting the Texans through a transitional phase (as they look to go from early draft pickers to AFC South contenders). He's a cost-effective, willing, and serviceable option while the Texans prepare their new man for life in the NFL.His performances certainly weren't awful and with his future on the line (along with a better roster), it's possible that he will improve markedly in the 2023 campaign.     "", ""Houston Texans Free Agency Signings\xa0  The Houston Texans have been busy during the free agency period, making a variety of moves to bolster their roster under new head coach DeMeco Ryans.   The team signed veteran wide receiver Robert Woods and traded for Tampa Bay Buccaneers right guard Shaq Mason. They also acquired former New York Jets defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins, among other signings.         Houston traded wide receiver Brandin Cooks to the Dallas Cowboys and extended left tackle Laremy Tunsil, making him the highest-paid offensive lineman in the NFL. These moves reflect the Houston Texans' commitment to strengthening their team, with an eye towards a successful 2023 season.            In this article, we will look at each new acquisition in depth, discussing their potential impact on the team.  Texans' Free Agency Deals Robert Woods, wide receiver The Houston Texans signed Robert Woods to a two-year, $15.25 million deal with $10 million fully guaranteed. Woods has been a consistent performer throughout his career, racking up 4,626 yards and 23 touchdowns over five seasons (2016-2021) with the LA Rams.  His familiarity with the west coast offense, which new offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik will implement, makes him a valuable addition to Houston's receiving corps. However, there are concerns about his age (30) and the fact that he's coming off a season with a career-low 527 yards.      The Texans will hope that Woods can regain his form and provide a reliable target for their rookie quarterback.  Shaq Mason, right guard Acquired in a trade with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Shaq Mason is expected to strengthen the Houston Texans' offensive line. He has been a solid starter throughout his career and is known for his run-blocking abilities.  Mason's experience and skill set should help the Texans improve their rushing attack. However, questions remain about his pass protection, as he allowed seven sacks in 2022.  The Texans will hope that Mason's addition can shore up their offensive line and provide better protection for their young quarterback.  Sheldon Rankins, defensive tackle The Houston Texans signed Sheldon Rankins to a one-year, $10.5 million deal in an attempt to address their league-worst run defense. Rankins, who played under New York Jets coach Robert Saleh, should be familiar with Ryans' defensive scheme, given the similarities between the two systems.      The veteran defensive tackle had a positive impact on the Jets' run defense, and the Texans will hope he can do the same for their struggling unit. However, as with Woods, there are concerns about his age (29). His lack of production in the sacks department may also limit his overall impact on the team.  Case Keenum, quarterback Case Keenum returns to Houston, where he began his career, on a two-year deal worth $6.25 million. The 10-year veteran has experience with various franchises and understands the west coast offense.  His signing as a backup, along with the Texans' decision to let go of Jimmy Garoppolo, suggests that the team will look to the draft to address the quarterback position. Keenum's age (35) and limited playing time in recent years are risks, but he should be a capable backup for the team.  Dalton Schultz, tight end The Houston Texans signed Dalton Schultz to a one-year deal worth $9 million. Over the past three seasons, he has emerged as one of the league's top tight ends, amassing 2,000 receiving yards and 17 touchdowns.      Schultz's blocking abilities make him a perfect fit for Slowik's west coast offense in Houston. However, his drop in receiving yards in 2022 raises concerns about whether he can maintain his productivity with a rookie quarterback and increased defensive focus on him.  Devin Singletary, running back Devin Singletary has joined the Houston Texans on a one-year deal worth up to $3.75 million. With 3,151 career rushing yards, he provides a change-of-pace option for the Texans' backfield.  Singletary has shown flashes of brilliance throughout his career, with a 4.4 yards per carry average and an ability to contribute as a receiver out of the backfield. However, concerns about his ball security and pass protection skills may limit his overall impact on the team.  Emmanuel Moseley, cornerback The Texans signed Emmanuel Moseley to a three-year, $18 million contract in free agency, bolstering their secondary.  Moseley has shown potential as a starting cornerback in the NFL with 110 tackles, 22 pass deflections, and two interceptions in his first four seasons. His experience in Ryans' defensive scheme from their time together in San Francisco should help him acclimate quickly to his new team.      However, Mosely's inconsistency in coverage and lack of elite ball skills may limit his ceiling as a top-tier cornerback.  Notable Houston Texans Departures The Houston Texans face significant challenges ahead of the 2023 NFL season following the departures of several key players in free agency this year.  Brandin Cooks' exit leaves a gap in the team's receiving corps, and O.J. Howard's and Jordan Akins' departures strip the Texans of tight end depth. Cooks was a reliable deep threat, while Howard and Akins provided big targets and steady contributions to the offense.  Meanwhile, the loss of Ogbonnia Okoronkwo will weaken the team's pass rush as he added valuable depth as a rotational outside linebacker. Rex Burkhead's departure might have less impact on the team's overall performance. The Texans' backfield has a number of capable running backs who can step up and share the load. Nonetheless, these departures present the Houston Texans with the challenge of finding suitable replacements either through free agency or the draft. They will also have to develop existing talent to fill the voids left by these notable players.     ""]"
5,Ben Roethlisberger,"[""Kenny Pickett's performance proves Steelers have a potential answer but not solution for Ben Roethlisberger's replacement  Kenny Pickett was selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was the organization's choice to take over as their future franchise quarterback following the retirement of Ben Roethlisberger during the 2022 NFL offseason. Roethlisberger retired after spending his entire 18 year career with the Steelers.  While Pickett would be tasked with filling big shoes, he didn't open the season as the starting quarterback. Instead, the Steelers named Mitchell Trubisky the Week 1 starter after signing him during the 2022 free agency period.        Trubisky struggled in his short time as the starting quarterback for the Steelers, losing two of his first three games. He entered a favorable match-up at home in Week 4 against the New York Jets, but failed to impress. By the end of the first half, the Steelers were trailing by a 10-6 score. This triggered head coach Mike Tomlin to make a change, bringing in rookie Kenny Pickett to replace Trubisky.           Pickett's NFL career got off to the roughest of starts as he threw an interception on his very first passing attempt ever. He would go on to complete ten of his 13 passing attempts for 120 yards, but all three of his incompletions were intercepted by the Jets defense. On a more positive note, Pickett recorded two rushing touchdowns. Dov Kleiman@NFL_DovKleimanThat was quick... Kenny Pickett throws an INT on his first drive in the NFL Was his first pass in the NFL.38362     It was a mixed performance for Pickett, who failed to complete the comeback against the Jets. Instead, the Steelers lost their third consecutive game. While it was only one half, Pickett will need to play much better moving forward. Especially if he's going to follow in Ben Roethlisberger's footsteps, which include two Super Bowl rings.     It's unclear at this point if Kenny Pickett will be named the starting quarterback moving forward or if the Steelers will give Trubisky another shot first, but an announcement by Mike Tomlin can be expected sometime prior to the Week 5 game. It will be a tough task for whoever gets named the starter, facing off against the Buffalo Bills, one of the best teams in the NFL with the top-ranked defense from a season ago.     Which teams passed on Kenny Pickett? Pittsburgh QB Kenny Pickett Pickett was the only quarterback selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft, going to the Steelers with the 20th overall pick. Several teams ahead of the Steelers in the draft order were rumored to be interested in drafting a quarterback in the first round, but ultimately decided to pass on Pickett.         The Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, and Seattle Seahawks all decided to pass on quarterbacks, filling other roster needs instead. Other teams that passed on Pickett in the first round drafted quarterbacks later. These were the Atlanta Falcons (Desmond Ridder), the Carolina Panthers (Matt Corral), and the Washington Commanders (Sam Howell). The Tennessee Titans also decided to take a quarterback later in the draft when Malik Willis fell to them in the third round. They weren't necessarily in the market for one, so didn't really pass on Pickett, but capitalized on drafting Willis for value where they got him. The New England Patriots similarly drafted Bailey Zappe in the fourth round, before a trio of speculative quarterbacks were selected late in the seventh round. Does Kenny Pickett really have small hands? Kenny Pickett at the 2022 NFL Combine     Kenny Pickett's hands measured in at just 8.5 inches during the 2022 NFL Combine. He officially has the smallest hands of any quarterback currently playing in the NFL, making his grip on the football a potential issue moving forward. While his hands are extremely small compared to other NFL quarterbacks, it's debatable how much of an impact that really has on a player's abilities. It's certain that the Steelers would have drafted him if they had any concerns about this. They scouted him thoroughly and would have watched endless tape of his college days before reaching a decision.It was great to see the rookie get on the field, although his debut didn't quite go to plan. We will see him develop and perhaps start some games in the near future.

', ""NFL: 5 best replacements for Ben Roethlisberger at the Pittsburgh Steelers\xa0  Earlier during the offseason, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger restructured his contract to help with his team's cap situation.  In doing so, Roethlisberger also ensured he'll be returning to the fold in the Steel City come September 9th as the starting quarterback. But after 16 fantastic years in the NFL, it's hard to imagine that Roethlisberger has too many more championship-caliber years left in him.        Currently, Mason Rudolph is the Steelers' backup quarterback. If you happened to catch his 2019 performances when filling in for the injured Roethlisberger, then you'll already know they fell beneath the high standards expected in Pittsburgh.           The experience may have aided his progression. But, personally, I don't think Rudolph is the solution in the long term. This of course begs the question of who Roethlisberger's successor will eventually be? Let's take a look. Five potential replacements for Ben Roethlisberger The Steelers have signed Ben Roethlisberger to a new contract, per @RapSheet 24th highest-graded QB in 2020 (69.0) pic.twitter.com/DQMUUJ4mEK‚Äî PFF (@PFF) March 4, 2021     #1 - Marcus Mariota (Las Vegas Raiders) Marcus Mariota 2014 Heisman Award-winning QB Marcus Mariota has struggled to live up to expectations in his NFL career. In Tennessee, his abilities seemed to wane year on year and it was no surprise to see him moved on to the Las Vegas Raiders during the 2020 offseason. Mariota has been back up to Derek Carr ever since. That being said, there are two reasons why this signing could work for the Steelers. First, Mariota is out of contract at the end of the 2021 season and has enough experience under his belt to come in and do a job and second, in the one-game viewers really got to see off Mariota last season, he performed quite well.         This performance does suggest that coach Gruden's influence on one of the best college players of all time has been paying off. Besides which, if all else fails, Mariota can simply keep the passing game simple and hand the ball off to Najee Harris, who looks destined to have a tremendous career in the NFL. #2 - Carson Strong (Nevada)        Of all the quarterbacks I've seen this week in preparation for next year's 2022 NFL draft, the Nevada Wolf Pack's signal-caller Carson Strong is certainly the closest to Roethlisberger's style of play. He is potentially a college talent that the Steelers will keep an eye on. Like Roethlisberger, Strong is a traditional pocket-passer blessed with a gun of an arm, accurate delivery, and, at 6-foot-4, a real presence behind the line. Of course, the Steelers could vouch for a host of other quarterbacks in next year's draft. But with 5,193 yards, 38 TDs and just 11 picks in his first two campaigns as a starter in Nevada, Mike Tomlin and co. could do a lot worse than Carson Strong in their quest to replace Roethlisberger. #3 - Drew Lock or Teddy Bridgewater (Denver Broncos) Denver Broncos v Atlanta Falcons     With Drew Lock now vying with the former-Panther, Teddy Bridgewater, for quarterback supremacy in Denver. One of the two signal-callers will likely be deemed surplus to requirements come the 2022 offseason. Teddy Bridgewater threw for 3,733 passing yards, 15 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for Carolina in 2020. Drew Lock managed 2,933 passing yards, 16 touchdowns and 15 picks for the Broncos. With those stats, neither player is likely to pacify a Steelers fanbase used to watching such talents as Terry Bradshaw and Ben Roethlisberger at Heinz Field. But both would be decent stop-gap options if coach Tomlin and GM Kevin Colbert feel there isn't value for them in the 2022 NFL draft. #4 - Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers) Aaron Rodgers is reportedly not happy with the Packers and he has told the organization he does not want to return to the team, per @AdamSchefter Rodgers: PFF's highest-graded player in 2020 (95.1) pic.twitter.com/xTHVEAlZBF‚Äî PFF (@PFF) April 29, 2021     Aaron Rodgers wants out of Green Bay. The Pittsburgh Steelers franchise is one of the most renowned and storied in sports. If the quarterback is granted his wish, I'd expect to see the Steelers sniffing around for the 2020 NFL MVP and the quarterback reciprocating the interest. It probably won't happen, but the Steelers have as good a chance as any other team of persuading Rodgers to join their ranks and, of course, he'd be an excellent replacement for Roethlisberger. #5 - Mitchell Trubisky (Buffalo Bills) Mitchell Trubisky: 63.5 PFF Grade in 2020T-32nd among QBs pic.twitter.com/6eOYBFqsJ6‚Äî PFF (@PFF) March 18, 2021     Bear with me here. For all the hate he receives for not being Patrick Mahomes, Mitchell Trubisky has still thrown almost twice as many touchdowns as he has interceptions in his short career. He's been to the playoffs twice and he's young enough to improve further whilst learning a more dynamic style of offense under Sean McDermott and Brian Daboll at the Bills training center. And who knows what kind of tricks he'll pick up from Josh Allen over in Buffalo, too. Like my first pick Marcus Mariota, I just don't think Trubisky is over and done with in the NFL just yet. Someone will give him another opportunity, so why not the Steelers next year if Roethlisberger retires?Trubisky lining up alongside RB Najee Harris, WRs JuJu Smith-Schuster, Chase Claypool and Diontae Johnson doesn't sound all that bad to me.Plus, it's not like Roethlisberger didn't have a nightmare season back in 2006 (18 touchdowns, 23 interceptions).

Roethlisberger's retirement has been on the horizon for quite some time, as his play has been declining as of late. Big Ben has a host of records and accolades on his extensive NFL resume, but none more important than winning the Super Bowl. In Roethlisberger's 18 seasons, he's only won the Super Bowl twice.        Which Ben Roethlisberger Super Bowl is more impressive?           Ben Roethlisberger had himself quite a career and one of the best back-to-back seasons in NFL history. The Steelers drafted him in 2004, and due to some lackluster performances from Tommy Maddox, Roethlisberger was fast-tracked right into the starting quarterback position for the team. The 2004 season saw Roethlisberger go 13-0 and take his team to the AFC Championship, where they would lose to eventual Super Bowl winners, the New England Patriots. That season would not turn out to be a fluke as the Steelers returned to proper form in 2005, with Ben Roethlisberger leading the way. The Steelers went 11-5 on the season before heading into the playoffs. The Steelers were seeded lower than the Cincinnati Bengals, whom they beat in the divisional round.

His 22.6 passer rating is the worst in Super Bowl history that also included the winning team. Regardless, the team came together for an impressive win and logged their first Super Bowl win under the lead of Ben Roethlisberger.     It would take three seasons before the Steelers would once again find themselves in the final show. The 2008 season saw Roethlisberger and the Steelers post a 12-4 record. Even though they had clinched the NFC North with a win over the Baltimore Ravens in Week 15, they would lose to the Tennessee Titans in Week 16 netting them the #2 seed in the AFC. That meant a first-round bye week. The Steelers will go on to beat the San Diego Chargers in the divisional round of the playoffs. They then faced their division rival and nemesis Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship. The final score was 23-14, leading them back to the Super Bowl to face the Arizona Cardinals. Super Bowl XLIII went much different for Roethlisberger this time around. Even with how good the Cardinals' defense was, he still managed to complete 21 of 30 passes, with 377 yards, 1 TD, and 1 INT.

This included a game-winning TD that saw the Steelers take a 27-23 lead with 35 seconds left. The Cardinals were not allowed to answer back and the Steelers would win.

Ben Roethlisberger and more  Saturday's Wild Card playoff game saw rookie quarterback Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers defeat the Seattle Seahawks 41-23. It was an impressive display that raised the question of how often quarterbacks lead their teams to playoff wins in their debut seasons.  While many have led their teams to the playoffs, only a select few have managed to achieve the feat of winning a playoff game in their first season. Here is a list of 5 quarterbacks to have won a playoff game in their rookie season.                   #1. Ben Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh Steelers (2004 season)  AFC Wild Card Playoffs - Former Pittsburgh Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Ben Roethlisberger in the first round of the 2004 NFL draft. Initially, he was the third-choice quarterback on the team behind Tommy Maddox and Charlie Batch. However, due to an injury to Batch during the preseason (and poor performances) and an injury to Maddox in Week 3, Roethlisberger was given an opportunity. He led the team to win a playoffs game in his rookie season.

He made his playoff debut in the Divisional round against the New York Jets and helped lead the team to victory in overtime with a game-winning field goal. The Steelers lost the AFC championship game to eventual Super Bowl champions the New England Patriots. #2. Joe Flacco, Baltimore Ravens (2008 season)  New York Jets Joe Flacco     The Baltimore Ravens selected Joe Flacco as the 18th overall pick in 2008 NFL draft. Flacco was meant to be the third-choice quarterback, but due to injuries to starter Kyle Boller and an illness to Tro Smit, Flacco was given the nod. Flacco finished his rookie season with a pass completion percentage of 60.0%, 2,971 yards, and 16 touchdowns. Flacco and the Ravens secured their place in the playoffs and defeated the Miami Dolphins 27-9 in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. Flacco became the first quarterback to win two consecutive playoff games in their rookie season after a 13-10 divisional-round victory over the Tennessee Titans. The Ravens lost the AFC championship game against the Steelers 14-23. #3. Mark Sanchez, New York Jets (2009 season)  Jacksonville Jaguars v New York Jets     Mark Sanchez was taken in the first round of the 2009 NFL draft. The New York Jets traded their first- and second-round selections, as well as three players, to the Cleveland Browns to take him fifth overall. The 2009 season began on a high note for Sanchez, winning three consecutive Pepsi Rookie of the Week awards in the first three weeks of the campaign. He also made history by becoming the first rookie quarterback to start and win his first three NFL games.

Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks (2012 season) Russell Wilson - St. Louis Rams v Seattle Seahawks, 2012     Russell Wilson was selected by the Seahawks as the 75th overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft. After competing for the starter position with veteran quarterback Matt Flynn and Tarvaris Jackson, Wilson was given the nod for the 2021 season. Wilson threw for 3,118 yards and 26 touchdowns in his rookie season, tying the record set by Peyton Manning for most touchdown passes by a rookie. Wilson's ability as a running quarterback contributed to 489 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. Led by Wilson, the Seahawks secured a playoff spot and went on to win their wild-card round game against the Washington Redskins by a score of 24-14. Wilson had a solid performance, throwing for 187 yards and rushing for 67 yards.

The 49ers met the Seahawks in the Wild Card game of the playoffs and won 41-23.Purdy threw for 332 yards and three passing touchdowns, as well as scoring a rushing touchdown. Purdy will have the chance to become the third rookie quarterback to win consecutive playoff games.     ""]"
6,Josh Allen,"['Josh Allen addresses poor performance in The Match, claims he was carried by Patrick Mahomes  Josh Allen may be one of the top quarterbacks in football, but the golf course shows a different side of his athletic abilities, or lack thereof. The Buffalo Bills signal-caller teamed up with AFC rival Patrick Mahomes this week to take part in the charity golf event known as The Match.  The two young quarterbacks went up against the old-timers of the NFC in Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers. Rodgers seemed to be the most gifted among the foursome, although Patrick Mahomes had some nice-looking shots as well.        The following day, Allen took to Twitter to check on his partner‚Äôs back and added a little self-deprecation.

In the end, it was a beautifully hit putt on the final hole that drove home the win for Brady and Rodgers. In Allen‚Äôs defense, it seemed as though he started to heat up as the day went along and even narrowly missed dropping in an incredibly long putt on the final hole.     What Allen lacked in golf skills he more than made up for in trash talk. After an impressive drive by Rodgers, the Bills quarterback commented on how good his opponent was and credited it to Rodgers skipping OTAs. Allen was also the target of several verbal jabs from Brady, mostly concerning his weight and lack of Super Bowl wins. The trash talk was apparent among the announcers as well, which included NBA great Charles Barkley and Arizona Cardinals sackmaster J.J. Watt.        Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes put their rivalry on the back burner for a round of charity golf Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes gave NFL fans one of the most thrilling games of all time in last season‚Äôs AFC divisional round. The two have been labeled the next Brady and Manning in their fledgling rivalry that, thus far, has gone in Mahomes‚Äô favor.        As the 2022 season approaches, Allen will look to turn the tide in the rivalry and lead his Buffalo Bills through the playoffs and to the Super Bowl. Mahomes, meanwhile, will attempt to get back there without one of his biggest weapons in Tyreek Hill. The lightning-quick wide receiver suits up this season as a Miami Dolphin.With The Match behind him, Allen looks forward to rejoining the Bills and charging into the season opener against the defending world champion Los Angeles Rams.Also Checkout:- Patrick Mahomes House     ', 'NFL analyst challenges Josh Allen to overcome last season‚Äôs ‚Äòalarming‚Äô performances in 2023 - ‚ÄúHe has the most to prove‚Äù  For Josh Allen, there has been a lot of discussion about his performances since last season came to a disappointing end to the Cincinnati Bengals.  There were no doubts that the best three teams in the conference were the Bengals, the Buffalo Bills and the Kansas City Chiefs, but the cold reality is that the Bills lost in the playoffs three straight times for the other two opponents.         Even worse, the 33-14 loss to the Bengals in January had Allen with such a poor performance that star wide receiver Stefon Diggs was screaming at him on the sidelines.           The quarterback\'s talent is not a question by any means, but the pressure is starting to mount after not reaching the Super Bowl in the past few years, while Mahomes and Burrow dominated the conference over the last four seasons.  ESPN analyst Freddie Coleman gave his verdict on First Take, and he believes that this is a year where Allen is under immense pressure: ‚ÄúI hate to do this to Josh Allen, because I think he and I know he\'s an elite quarterback in the NFL. But he has the most to prove, especially after last year, because how much do we hear? To be fair, the Damar Hamlin situation at the end of the season would wreck a lot of teams, but I thought, even before that happened, he did not deal [well] with the pressure.""      ""Those 14 interceptions were alarming. I thought he put too much on himself, and you can\'t be the best quarterback and the best running back with all that pressure, and think that\'s going to work in your favor.‚Äù Is Josh Allen good? Is he an elite quarterback? He\'s an excellent quarterback who isn\'t afraid of absolutely nothing, whether it\'s taking risks with his throws in tight windows, throwing a bomb with his strong arm or hitting a defender when he\'s running with the football. With an arm capable of making any and all types of throws, he can pull an explosive play out of nowhere at any time. He has also greatly improved his decision-making -- and because of his arm strength, he can connect with his receivers in windows that most quarterbacks don\'t even see.     There\'s no doubt he belongs to the \'elite\' tier.When will the Buffalo Bills start the 2023 season?They have a mouth-watering matchup against the Aaron Rodgers-led New York Jets on September 11, during a Monday Night Football game.Apart from the 22nd anniversary of September 11, 2001, Allen and Rodgers going head-to-head will be one of the best quarterback duels of the season.

Josh Allen has played four games this season where the temperatures have fallen below 40 degrees. He has won three out of those four games and so, will be having a weather advantage in the upcoming contest.        Temperatures are expected to go as low as 29 degrees, and Tua Tagovailoa is known to struggle in cold weather games.           Josh Allen lost the first game played in sub-40 degrees conditions, against the Minnesota Vikings, in Week 10. With winds sweeping at 11 miles per hour, the temperature dropped to 38 degrees. Vikings with a 8-1 record then, defeated the Bills, 33-30. Allen threw for 330 yards with a pass completion percentage of 67.44, and one touchdown.    Since then, the Bills have been playing in much colder temperatures and have won all their games, against the Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, and the New York Jets.     Despite winning, Josh Allen's performances saw a drop in these games. He threw for less than 250+ yards and had four passing touchdowns in all three games, which saw temperatures below 40 degrees. Allen averaged 205.6 passing yards, a 54.4 percent completion rate, and a 78.3 rating in five games below 40 degrees last season. The Buffalo Bills averaged 26 points per game.

7,Jared Goff,"['Jared Goff 2021  Jared Goff is under pressure in 2021  In the spring of 2016, the L.A. Rams were on the clock with the first overall pick. The then Rams director of college scouting Brad Holmes fell in love with California quarterback Jared Goff. Holmes pounded the table so hard that he left GM Les Snead no option but to draft Goff.        Fast forward to January 2021, and Brad Holmes is the new GM of the Detroit Lions. And in his first move as GM, Holmes dealt Matthew Stafford to the Rams for two first-round picks and Jared Goff.           Plenty of pundits expect year one to be a tricky year for Goff. Therefore, year one would get classed as a mulligan for Goff. Instead, in Thursday\'s press conference, Brad Holmes firmly put the pressure on Goff: ""So Jared is a very accurate quarterback, and he has receivers that are getting open. I think it\'s been easy to evaluate Jared."" That\'s correct; the man who fought vehemently for Jared Goff is now telling him that the pressure is on. Despite his healthy relationship with the GM, Goff is in the spotlight. #Lions have acquired QB Jared Goff and undisclosed draft selections from the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for QB Matthew Stafford.üì∞ https://t.co/DvO7cltnjR pic.twitter.com/8aXvkWuuSi‚Äî Detroit Lions (@Lions) March 18, 2021     Jared Goff must perform. Due to the Lions\' beefy draft capital, every draft analyst will link the Lions to a quarterback. It would have been easy if Holmes had said year one, the pressure is off Goff, and he\'s the guy. Holmes chose not to. That speaks volumes about the quarterback situation. The ball is firmly in Goff\'s court. At the end of the season meetings, Holmes won\'t make concessions when discussing Goff\'s performance. At 27-years years old, Goff isn\'t old - he should be entering the prime years of his career. Instead, he arrives in Detroit as an outcast. Sean McVay no longer wanted Goff on his team. After a joyous Super Bowl run, Goff\'s play declined to an alarming level. The interceptions and bad decisions became more prominent in his game. That became untenable, and the team that gave up so much to draft him and then paid him a boatload quit on him.     History is not on Goff\'s side. Recently, NFL teams have used young quarterbacks on rookie deals as a ticket for success. Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, and Carson Wentz enjoyed great success on rookie contracts. Despite restructuring Goff\'s contract, it is still a bloated deal for a player deemed damaged goods. There is always a good crop of young collegiate quarterbacks coming through for the 2022 NFL Draft. That complicates the situation for Goff. Dan Campbell spoke about biding his time for a quarterback in the offseason. The new head coach spoke glowingly about how the Chiefs waited for the right player at quarterback. The Lions won\'t worry about the cap concerns. The salary cap is set for an increase once the new NFL TV deal kicks in. Teams are no longer concerned about carrying dead cap money. It muddies the situation for Goff even more. After sweating on the decision to draft Jared Goff in 2016, the new GM has firmly put pressure on Goff. He expects quality quarterback play. Holmes wants Goff to step up and command the Lions locker room.     Sportspeople often hit crossroads in their respective careers. Jared Goff is at a massive crossroads. His career in the NFL as a starting quarterback is on the line. His most trusted confidant is not going to make excuses for him - no one else will. The unassuming Californian needs to go out roaring like a Lion in 2021. Otherwise, his stayover in Detroit might resemble a pit stop.The Jared Goff restructure is officially on the books, and the NFLPA public salary cap report now has the Lions with approximately $22.4 million in available cap space. pic.twitter.com/73AVMNEOHv‚Äî Chris Burke (@ChrisBurkeNFL) April 1, 2021Also Read: Who is Jared Goff\'s Girlfriend, Christen Harper?

"", ""Jared Goff or Geno Smith: Who is a better pick?\xa0  Jared Goff has his fans and critics, but both camps would agree to feel sorry for him after the events of the 2021 NFL season. The Los Angeles Rams, the team that drafted Goff first overall in the 2016 NFL Draft, traded him away with a couple of picks to the Detroit Lions for Matthew Stafford. That trade was the catalyst for the Rams' Super Bowl success.   On the other hand, Goff was made to endure a frustrating year at the perennial league punching bag, the Detroit Lions. This season has not been too different from Goff's debut in Detroit, as the shot caller is pulling off a stat line of 1,583 passing yards, 11 touchdowns, and six picks, good for a 52.6 QBR score.        However, Geno Smith is having the best spell of his eight-and-a-half-year NFL career. He is finally fulfilling the promise he showed in college. Geno is a true rennaissance story. The quarterback rose out of the Seattle Seahawks' departed legend Russell Wilson's shadow to become one of the most in-form shot callers in the league so far this 2022 season. Geno Smith is racking up stats of 1,712 passing yards, 11 touchdowns, and three picks, good for a 66.8 QBR score.           Verdict: Geno Smith will be a better pick for your fantasy team. Geno Smith's Seattle Seahawks have a much better record than Jared Goff's Detroit Lions. And judging by the squad depth of both franchises, those records will be similar come the end of the regular season. Quarterback ability greatly affects a franchise's performance, and at the moment, Geno Smith has just too much ability over Jared Goff.          View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Why Geno Smith is a better fantasy pick than Jared Goff Geno Smith is a better fantasy pick than Jared Goff for many reasons. First, he has more momentum than Goff due to his team's unexpected playoff push in his first year as a starter. Momentum goes a long way in the NFL fantasy league. So we can only look further than the West Virginia alum. Also, there's the team factor, which is directly affected by quarterback play. Smith plays for a team, the Seattle Seahawks, that is better than the Detroit Lions. The Lions have sucked for a long time, while the Seahawks are perennial playoff contenders. You need not be a rocket scientist to know who would finish higher at the end of the season.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     How did Jared Goff and Geno Smith perform last season? Jared Goff and Geno Smith had significantly differing seasons in the 2021 NFL season, with the shot callers playing different roles for their franchises. Jared Goff was a starter for the NFL basement team, the Detroit Lions. He pulled up stats of 3,245 passing yards, 19 touchdowns, and eight picks, good for a 45.5 QBR score in fourteen starts. On the other hand, Geno Smith spent the 2021 NFL season backing up former Seattle Seahawks franchise quarterback Russell Wilson. Hence, his stat line reads 702 passing yards, five touchdowns, and one pick, good for a 45.5 QBR score in four games.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     How have Jared Goff and Geno Smith performed this season? Jared Goff and Geno Smith entered this season with pretty different expectations. Goff was expected to possibly take the Lions to another level that he became accustomed to while with the Los Angeles Rams. Unfortunately, Goff has yet to do that, and the Lions are sitting at the bottom of the league with a 1-5 record. His next game is against Tua Tagovailoa's Miami Dolphins, so it doesn't get easier. On the other hand, Geno Smith outperforms every NFL quarterback not named Josh Allen, Patrick Mahomes, or Joe Burrow. The eight-year veteran has finally hit his stride, and it remains to be seen who will stop him and the Seahawks. Geno Smith has led the Seahawks to a 4-3 start to the season, giving them no need to look into the draft or free agency for a Russell Wilson replacement.              View this post on Instagram            Instagram PostIn their upcoming Week 8 matchup, Geno and the Seahawks are up against the rampant New York Giants.

He has finished inside the top ten quarterbacks in each of his last seven games, including five top-fives and two QB1's. While the Philadelphia Eagles have an excellent defense, Fields should be trusted in the fantasy lineup for as long as his scorching hot streak continues.     Dak Prescott - Dallas Cowboys vs. Jacksonville Jaguars Dallas Cowboys QB Dak Prescott Dak Prescott will be looking to bounce back in Week 15 following a disappointing performance last week against the Houston Texans. He has an ideal matchup to do so in Week 15 against the Jacksonville Jaguars. They rank in the bottom eight in fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks.

The Los Angeles Rams, champions of the NFC, faced off against the Cincinnati Bengals, champions of the AFC. The game was coached by Sean McVay for the Los Angeles Rams and Zac Taylor for the Cincinnati Bengals.  The Rams had a solid regular season, finishing with a record of 12-5. They won their division and then defeated the Arizona Cardinals, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game to advance to the Super Bowl. McVay traded for Quarterback Matthew Stafford from the Detroit Lions ahead of the season, sending former starting QB Jared Goff the other way. Stafford led the team's offense, completing 367 passes for 4,886 yards and 40 touchdowns, along with Cooper Kupp setting franchise receiving records for catches and yards, winning the triple crown (most receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns in a season). The defense was led by three-time Defensive Player of the Year Aaron Donald, who recorded 13.5 sacks that season, and defensive coordinator Brandon Staley. They also made significant moves this season, adding former Super Bowl MVP Von Miller to the defense and superstar receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to the offense.        The Bengals also had a successful regular season, finishing with a record of 10-7. They entered the playoffs as the number 4 seed, winning the AFC North. They then defeated the Las Vegas Raiders, the Tennesse Titans, and the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game to advance to Super Bowl LVI. Quarterback Joe Burrow led the team's offense, throwing for 4,611 yards and 34 touchdowns, including 1,415 yards and 13 touchdowns to Rookie wide receiver JaMarr Chase.

"", 'Los Angeles Rams training camp 2021: 5 players to watch out for  The Los Angeles Rams look set to challenge for the NFC title and another Super Bowl berth this season. They made one of the biggest off-season moves when they traded starting quarterback Jared Goff to the Detroit Lions for veteran QB Matthew Stafford.  Rams\'s head coach Sean McVay will be salivating at the prospect of working with Stafford and designing plays for his new quarterback. Big things are expected from the new-look LA Rams\' offense in 2021.        As training camp approaches, there are a few Rams players who will be looking to impress before pre-season games get underway in August.                    View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Los Angeles Rams (@rams) Here are five players to keep an eye on during the Rams\' upcoming training camp. #1 Matthew Stafford The veteran NFL quarterback has a lot of pressure on him, heading into training camp in late July. The Rams have bet their future on the 33-year-old QB by trading former starter Jared Goff and future first-round draft picks for Stafford.     In Detroit, Stafford made only one Pro Bowl and won zero playoff games over 12 seasons in the motor city. Expectations are much higher in Los Angeles, so Rams fans will want to see Stafford show some quality play during training camp.  #2 Cam Akers Rams rookie Cam Akers was a workhorse last season. He had 145 rushing attempts for 625 yards and two touchdowns. The arrival of Matthew Stafford will only enhance Akers\' production in 2021. Akers will be challenged for the starting job by Darrell Henderson Jr. in training camp, so he will need to continue to show improvement in 2021. Keep an eye on the second-year running back\'s performance during training camp.  #3 Aaron Donald          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Los Angeles Rams (@rams)     The Rams\' star defensive powerhouse ended last season injured and was unable to help the team to another Super Bowl appearance. So, all eyes will be on the three-time Defensive Player of the Year at training camp this year. Donald should be leading from the front in practice and putting pressure on new quarterback Matthew Stafford. Now 30, the defensive tackle will be gunning to win his first NFL championship.  #4 Desean Jackson Rams\' coaching staff and fans will be hoping to see an injury-free Desean Jackson in training camp. The veteran wide receiver has been plagued by injuries over the past couple of seasons. Jackson is renowned for being a deep threat to opposing NFL defenses. Now 34, it will be interesting to see if he still has the elite speed to get behind the secondary. The three-time Pro Bowler is still seeking his first Super Bowl ring.  #5 Leonard Floyd     The outside linebacker was a revelation for the Los Angeles Rams last season. The 6\' 6"", 240 lbs Floyd recorded 55 tackles, one forced fumble and 10.5 sacks in 2020.He was recently rewarded with a four-year extension by the Rams, so the team will expect him to continue his dominant ways. Floyd and Donald look set to terrify opposing offenses again this season.     ', 'Touchdown Kings: Top 10 quarterbacks with the most touchdowns in the 2022 regular season  Throughout the 2022 regular season, several quarterbacks put on impressive performances, leading their teams to victory with their touchdown passes and skilled runs into the end zone.  The 2022-2023 season has come to an end with an exciting Super Bowl matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. After a tight and high-scoring game, the Chiefs emerged victorious with a 38-35 win.        Here is a list of the top 10 quarterbacks with the most regular season touchdowns for the 2022-2023 season.            #10 Tom Brady, 26 touchdowns NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Dallas Cowboys v Tampa Bay Buccaneers In his final NFL season, Tom Brady finished 2022 as the quarterback with the 10th most touchdowns, scoring a total of 26 touchdowns. Of those, 25 were passes to the endzone, and also managed to score one rushing touchdown. Over the course of the season, Brady threw for an impressive 4,694 yards and led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to the division title in the NFC South.     While Brady and the Buccaneers had an impressive regular season, their journey came to a disappointing end when they lost to the Dallas Cowboys in the wildcard round of the playoffs.  #9 Aaron Rodgers, 27 Detroit Lions v Green Bay Packers In the 2022 regular season, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers did not perform up to his usual high standards. Despite this, he still managed to score a total of 27 touchdowns, with 26 being passing and 1 rushing. However, Rodgers\' future has been the subject of media speculation for much of the post-season, leaving fans and analysts wondering where he will play next season. Regardless of where he ends up, there is no denying that Rodgers is one of the most talented quarterbacks in the league.      #8 Jared Goff, 29 Detroit Lions v Green Bay Packers Jared Goff, the quarterback for the Detroit Lions, had an impressive 2022 regular season. However, he narrowly missed out on a spot in the playoffs on the final day. Throughout the season, Goff scored an impressive 29 passing touchdowns. Goff\'s performance in the second half of the season was particularly noteworthy, as he scored 15 TDs and had zero interceptions. In fact, he ranked first in TD-INT ratio from weeks 10-18, showcasing his skill and accuracy on the field.      #7 Trevor Lawrence, 30 2023 NFL Pro Bowl Games Trevor Lawrence, nicknamed ""The Prince,"" demonstrated significant improvement in his sophomore season with an impressive performance that led the Jacksonville Jaguars to the divisional round of the playoffs. Over the course of the 2022 season, Lawrence scored a total of 30 touchdowns, with 25 passing and 5 rushing. Despite facing a challenging start to his NFL career, Lawrence\'s talent and potential cannot be overlooked. With the guidance of head coach Doug Pederson, Lawrence is projected to have an even better season in 2023 and beyond.      Tied #5 Kirk Cousins, 31 NFC Wild Card Playoffs - New York Giants v Minnesota Vikings Kirk Cousins had an outstanding regular season as the quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings, culminating in a 13-4 winning record in 2022. Impressively, Cousins tallied a total of 31 touchdowns - 29 of which were passing touchdowns, with an additional 2 scored by rushing. A key factor contributing to his success was the strong supporting cast in the offense, which included standout players such as Justin Jefferson. Cousins\' impressive performance highlights not only his own skills and talent but also the importance of a well-rounded team effort.      Tied #5 Geno Smith, 31 NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Seattle Seahawks v San Francisco 49ers Geno Smith, in his tenth year in the NFL, had the best season of his career to date. After serving as a backup to Russell Wilson for the past three seasons, he finally had his opportunity to lead the Seattle Seahawks as their starting quarterback. Impressively, he led the league in pass completion percentage with an impressive 69.8%. He finished the 2022 regular season with 30 passing and 1 rushing touchdown, placing him fifth among quarterbacks for the most touchdowns.     Gregg Bell@gbellseattleNFL NextGen Stats says Geno Smith‚Äôs 52 yarder to DK Metcalf for Seahawks at SF last weekend was his 14th deep TD pass this season.Smith led NFL in deep TD passes (13) in the regular season.

In the 2022 regular season, he achieved the best record as a starting quarterback, leading the Eagles to an impressive 14-1 record in games started. Furthermore, Hurts led the Eagles to the Super Bowl, where they narrowly lost to the Chiefs by a score of 38-35. Despite the loss, Hurts set a Super Bowl record for his impressive stats as a losing quarterback. Over the course of the regular season, Hurts tallied a remarkable 35 touchdowns, including 22 passing and 13 rushing.  #3 Joe Burrow, 40 AFC Championship - Cincinnati Bengals v Kansas City Chiefs     Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals came tantalizingly close to replicating their Super Bowl run from the previous season. However, they fell just one game short when they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Chiefs. Burrow\'s outstanding performances throughout the season have been a major factor in the team\'s success. He has cemented his status as one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL. Burrow\'s regular-season performance was particularly impressive, with a whopping 35 passing touchdowns supplemented by 5 rushing to the endzone for a total of 40.  #2 Josh Allen, 42 AFC Divisional Playoffs - Cincinnati Bengals v Buffalo Bills     The 2022 pre-season designated MVP, Josh Allen, had an outstanding season, notching an impressive 42 total touchdowns, including 35 passing and 7 rushing. Despite his remarkable performance, however, Allen and the Buffalo Bills were unable to improve upon their 2021 postseason record, losing to the Bengals in the divisional round of the 2022 season. Built in Buffalo@BuiltInBuffalo_Total Touchdowns since 2020:Patrick Mahomes 124Josh Allen 129#BillsMafia100077 Although Allen received just one first-place vote in the MVP race, he has established himself as one of the league\'s top quarterbacks. The 26-year-old will no doubt be a strong contender for the award in future seasons.      #1 Patrick Mahomes, 45 Super Bowl LVII - Winning Head Coach and MVP Press Conference Patrick Mahomes, the talented quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, had an imperious 2022 regular season. He threw a league-leading 41 passing touchdowns and added 4 more rushes to the endzone for a total of 45, which was the most in the league. This achievement is even more impressive when considering the loss of one of the league\'s best receivers, Tyreek Hill. Mahomes\' performance was undoubtedly a major factor in him winning the league MVP award.Furthermore, Mahomes\' leadership and skill helped the Chiefs secure the Super Bowl championship, where he received the Super Bowl MVP award despite battling an ankle injury. This speaks volumes about Mahomes\' resilience, determination and exceptional talent.     ']"

More importantly, six of his ten punts landed inside the 49ers\' 20-yard line, which proved crucial.

Most critics saw the highly-hyped Manning\'s unofficial college football debut as a flop.  The five-star New Orleans native and nephew of Hall of Famer Peyton Manning failed to impress as Maalik Murphy‚Äôs backup for the Orange team.

He was a five-star recruit, ranking as such by all big four recruiting media companies: ESPN, Rivals, 247Sports and On3. The hotly sought-after quarterback picked the Longhorns over a handful of other top-tier programs, including the Crimson Tide, Clemson Tigers, Georgia Bulldogs and LSU Tigers. Despite the slight backlash, Eli believes that Arch‚Äôs early enrollment at Texas will pay off in the long haul. The 6-foot-4 quarterback completed his senior year at Isadore Newman with 2,407 yards and 34 touchdowns, placing him at the top of the 2023 recruiting class. That‚Äôs why expectations among analysts and Texas fans are sky-high from the get-go.On this part, Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian has said that he won\'t rush Manning along. He plans to have him play second fiddle to the incumbent QB come the start of the season as Texas battles for a spot in the Big 12 championship game.     ', ""Peyton Manning vs Eli Manning: Which brother performed better in their respective Super Bowl wins?\xa0  Peyton Manning and Eli Manning have a lot of similarities. Both are former quarterbacks in the NFL who hail from the same family. They were both selected first overall in their respective drafts and both won two Super Bowls.  There is little doubt, though, who the better quarterback was between them. Peyton Manning is a Hall-of-Famer. He famously changed the league in how quarterbacks would react at the line of scrimmage and change plays. He holds the record for most touchdown passes in a season with 55. He reached four Super Bowls compared to the two of his younger brother. His overall impact on the game has been much greater than Eli Manning's.        Denver Broncos@BroncosLegacy cemented. Peyton Manning reveals his @ProFootballHOF bust!: @nflnetwork1490230           But who among them was better when it mattered the most? Peyton Manning won both Super Bowl XLI (2007) and 50 (2016) and was the Super Bowl MVP in the former. Eli Manning won Super Bowls XLII (2008) and XLVI (2012) and was the Super Bowl MVP both times. Let's look deeper to decide which of the Manning brothers fared better in their Super Bowl wins. Peyton Manning and Eli Manning: A Super Bowl matchup     Indianapolis Colts vs. New York Giants (image credit - Bleacher Report) Peyton Manning played in four Super Bowls and won two. He won one and lost one with both the Indianapolis Colts and the Denver Broncos. In the ones where he did win, how much of a contribution to the eventual glory did he actually have? In Super Bowl XLI against the Chicago Bears, the Colts quarterback threw one touchdown and an interception and was sacked once. His passer rating was 81.8 and he passed for 247 yards. As mentioned before, that was enough to win him the Super Bowl MVP nod.     In Super Bowl 50 against the Carolina Panthers, his powers had clearly waned in what turned out to be his last season in the NFL. He threw for only 141 yards and did not have a single touchdown. However, he did throw an interception. He was sacked five times for a loss of 37 yards in total. He ended up with a passer rating of 56.6. The Broncos won the game because of their defense and Von Miller took home the Super Bowl MVP award. Now, let's take a look at Eli Manning. He won both his Super Bowls with the New York Giants against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. His first outing was in Super Bowl XLII. The Giants defeated the Patriots, who were coming off a perfect season until then, so the relative strength of the opposition was higher than what his elder brother faced.

Though he was sacked thrice, he only gave up a total of eight yards on those sacks. He passed for a total of 255 yards as he was named the Super Bowl MVP with a 87.3 passer rating. Note here that all the figures are already better than Peyton Manning achieved in either of his Super Bowl wins. But for the younger Manning, his best performance in a Super Bowl was to come in the XLVI edition. In that game, he threw for one touchdown and had no interceptions. His total passing yards were 296, achieved by connecting on 30 out of 40 attempts at an astounding 75% completion rate. His passer rating was accordingly 103.8 as he again walked away with the Super Bowl MVP award.        Consider also that Eli Manning never lost a Super Bowl, whereas his brother lost two. That in itself is a pretty impressive stat.Upon reflection, it is clear that Eli Manning has far outstripped his more illustrious brothers when it comes to Super Bowl performances. Peyton Manning may have achieved quite a lot, but when it came to crunch time, his younger brother held his nerve much better.     "", 'Tom Brady vs Eli Manning: Who had the last laugh?

', 'New York Giants great Eli Manning recalls trying to emulate Derek Jeter\'s stature in New York as a rookie: ""You want to get to Derek Jeter level""  Derek Jeter is not only a New York icon, but a sports icon. He was the face of the most recognizable sports team in the world for about two decades, winning five championships and cementing his status as an all-time champion.  However, he\'s not the only New York sports icon. He transcends the city, but he also shares it. In the NFL, Eli Manning is that sports icon. He is a two-time Super Bowl winning quarterback for the New York Giants.        When Manning first got to New York as a rookie in 2004, Jeter was well established. He had already won four of his five rings and had been in the league for nine full years at that point.      Manning recalls thinking he needed to be like Jeter when he first entered the league, as he told the former New York Yankees star on the Eli Manning Show.    Manning recalled a brutal performance with a zero quarterback rating, but that Jeter called him to lend some advice:     ""You called me... \'Keep grinding, keep your head up, New York\'s a tough place.\' It meant a lot to me cause when I was coming into New York, you were the role model. You were kinda, \'Hey, this is where you want to get to. You want to get to Derek Jeter level.\'"" Jeter\'s advice must have helped Manning because he would go on to become one of the most iconic players in New York football history.  How long did Derek Jeter play in New York? Derek Jeter was a longtime Yankee and he had the benefit of never playing anywhere else, something a lot of players today cannot say. He debuted in 1995, though he only played in 15 games. The following year, he won Rookie of the Year.     Derek Jeter retired in 2014He would go on to play for the Yankees until 2014 when he retired. He never had any major injury issues, save for a 2013 season (when he was 39) when he only played 17 games.Other than that, he never played less than 119 games and other than that season, never less than 148.

Injury update on Titans QB\xa0  The Tennessee Titans take on the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 18 in the AFC South title decider but will be without Ryan Tannehill.

However, the team placed him on the IR, effectively ending his season.           Who is the Titans' starting QB tonight against the Jaguars in Week 18 in Ryan Tannehill's absence? Tennessee Titans QB Joshua Dobbs Rookie Malik Willis was the team's backup quarterback for the majority of the 2022 season. He featured in eight games for the Titans, starting three, however, he was benched for the team's Week 17 clash against the Dallas Cowboys in favor of Joshua Dobbs.     NFL@NFLFirst career TD pass for @josh_dobbs1 #DALvsTEN on Prime VideoAlso available on NFL+ bit.ly/3Ww62cW2909333 Dobbs had a decent outing against the Cowboys. He threw for 232 yards and one touchdown with one interception in the Titans' 27-13 loss. The quarterback's performance was impressive enough for the team to name him as the starter for the game against the Jaguars. This is a huge opportunity for him to prove himself and stake a claim for next season.     "", ""Reasons why Malik Willis should start over Ryan Tannehill  The Ryan Tannehill era has been mired in regular season glory and playoff disappointment. Since arriving in Tennessee in 2019, Tannehill has made this once moribund franchise relevant again. With three consecutive postseason appearances under his belt, he has done his best to bring the Titans a Lombardi Trophy for the first time in their relatively short history.  Ultimately, regardless of his attempts, Tennessee fans have continually dug their heads into their hands in disgust as Tannehill has put up underwhelming performance after underwhelming performance.        Although the former Pro Bowler is set to return to the field as Tennessee's leader, Malik Willis, their recent third-round draft selection, appears to be lurking in the shadows. Unofficially, Willis seems to be the guy waiting in the wings as their quarterback of the future. Nevertheless, we'll tell you why that future needs to start now.           #1 - Start the growing pains early Tennessee Titans v Baltimore Ravens It was no surprise that Malik Willis drew the first preseason start of the year against the Baltimore Ravens. Both sidelines, however, were pleasantly surprised with what Willis had to offer.     In what amounted to only a short sample size, Willis was pretty terrific. The former collegiate star out of Liberty completed six of his 11 passes for 107 yards, throwing for an average of 9.7 yards per attempt. Willis, to his credit, also showed off his wheels, rushing the ball five times for 38 yards. It was about as dynamic a performance as he could have. Now, as a direct result, Tannehill's grip on the starting gig is beginning to loosen. Although allowing him to keep his spot in the lineup would probably lead to more wins this season for the Titans, it could stunt Willis' overall growth. At this point, we know what Tannehill is and what he isn't. Willis should be thrown into the fire and allowed to take his lumps early on. Sitting behind Tannehill would be a wrong move on Tennessee's part. #2 - Ryan Tannehill won't be here for the long haul     AFC Divisional Playoffs - Cincinnati Bengals v Tennessee Titans Realistically, the Titans will likely look to push Tannehill out the backdoor at the end of the 2022 season. With no talks of a possible contract extension, paired with Tannehill recently turning 34, the hourglass on his time in Tennessee is rapidly wasting away. In three full seasons as the Titans starter, Tannehill has enjoyed monumental success in the regular season, leading the Titans to double-digit victory totals in 2020 and 2021. However, when the postseason lights have shined their brightest, he has played impetuously.     The final straw that broke the camel's back was last season's divisional-round matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals. Despite being considered the favorites, Tannehill flat-out stunk up the joint, throwing for just 220 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions. Tennessee should look to replace him now with Malik Willis, who is undoubtedly their quarterback of the future. #3 - Malik Willis falls in line with the new-age quarterbacks Tennessee Titans v Baltimore Ravens Admittedly, Ryan Tannehill is a more than respectable quarterback and has been so for over a decade. However, he's seemingly missing something.     As we gaze upon the current signal-callers around the league, he fits the mold of yesteryear quarterbacks. The former Pro Bowler is accurate in the pocket but seldom uses his legs to get himself out of harm's way while picking up huge chunk yards for the Titans. On the other hand, Willis appears to look like a more modern-day quarterback. During his lone preseason outing, Willis not only threw the ball for 107 yards but also rushed for 38 impressive yards in his limited time. With his ability to threaten opposing defenses with his gigantic arm and quick feet, Willis is a much bigger threat out on the field than Tannehill could ever be.     "", '""Why\'d you have to do it like that?"" - Ryan Tannehill lauds AJ Brown\'s merciless revenge game vs Titans with Jon Robinson fired in aftermath\xa0  Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown was on a mission this past Sunday as he faced off against his former football team, the Tennessee Titans.  Tennessee drafted Brown with their second-round pick of the 2019 draft. The team decided to trade him this offseason and the Eagles were their trade partner, giving the Titans their 18th overall pick in the 2022 draft.        Brown faced off against his former team and had a career game. He recorded eight receptions for 119 yards and two touchdowns vs. his former team. Brown\'s former quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, went up to him after the game and lauded his performance while showing no mercy against his former team.           Tannehill said: ‚ÄúWhy\'d you have to do it like that?

The following season, he was selected to the Pro Bowl, as he recorded 70 receptions, 1,075 yards, and 11 touchdowns. Brown fell short of another 1,000 yards season in his third year as he played in 13 games, missing three to injuries. In 12 games with the Eagles this year, he\'s recorded 61 catches for 950 yards and nine touchdowns.     Shane Haff@HAFFnHAFF_TPLAJ Brown has 183 receiving yards over expectation on tight-window throws this season, 60 more than the next closest player (per NextGen Stats).533 AJ Brown could be part of the reason why the Tennessee Titans fired general manager Jon Robinson Arizona Cardinals vs. Titans.     Yesterday\'s news of the Tennessee Titans firing general manager Jon Robinson seemed a little strange. The Titans are currently 7-5 and have a three-game lead over the Indianapolis Colts and Jacksonville Jaguars in the division. He was the team\'s general manager from 2016 all the way up until yesterday.    Tennessee made the decision this offseason to extend wide receiver A.J. Brown or trade him. The team ultimately decided to trade him to the Eagles as Robinson called the finals shot. After seeing the year he is having, it was a reminder to the ownership of the many mistakes Robinson has made as general manager.The team traded for Julio Jones and picked Isaiah Wilson in the first round of the 2020 NFL draft. Neither of those trades worked in Tennessee\'s favor.     ', ""Is Derrick Henry playing tonight vs Chiefs in Week 9?\xa0  Without AJ Brown this year, Derrick Henry's stranglehold on leading the team's offense has only gotten stronger. However, bellcow running backs all have one massive downside. With all of the action comes a lot of hits and the odds for an injury increase as the season goes on.  Since he missed a large chunk of 2021, fans are nervous that they could be in for a repeat this year. How is Henry's health going into the team's toughest matchup of the year?        Put simply, the running back is a full go for the Sunday Night Football matchup against Patrick Mahomes' Kansas City Chiefs. Based on the exigent circumstances surrounding the team, Henry could be in for his biggest game of the season, which is saying something.              Derrick Henry's fantasy football update and predictions Derrick Henry     First and foremost, starting quarterback Ryan Tannehill is dealing with an ankle injury and is listed as questionable for the game. Last week, the veteran quarterback missed the contest and rookie Malik Willis made his first start of the season.  To make things easier on the rookie, they leaned on Derrick Henry and the running back exploded. In the game, he earned a season-high 32 attempts for 219 yards and two touchdowns. If Tannehill doesn't play this week, he will be in line for another such performance.        There is another reason for the Titans to lean into the running game. Considering how explosive the Chiefs' offense is, the Titans will have no hope but to lean into the running game. Games with a lot of running plays are shorter in length, giving Mahomes fewer chances to take the field and score more touchdowns. As such, leaning into the running back is doubly likely in this matchup. This, of course, will invite the Chiefs to stack the line of scrimmage. However, with Willis starting last week, many expected the same and Henry still feasted. Will the Chiefs linebackers be able to hold back the tide? However, if the Chiefs get an early lead and the Titans fail to score early, there is a chance that the Titans will be forced to throw early and often. For most teams, this would script out the running back, but their current running back is so instrumental to their offense that they simply cannot afford to stop running the ball.Expect the running back to have at least 25 touches in the contest, unless they fall behind by 21 or more points.     "", ""What happened to Malik Willis? Reason why Titans QB isn't playing tonight vs. Cowboys revealed  Malik Willis was listed as the backup quarterback to Joshua Dobbs when the Tennessee Titans took on the Dallas Cowboys today in Thursday Night football. It was seen as quite the surprise because Dobbs only joined the team on December 21, whereas Willis has been the regular backup to Ryan Tannehill.  However, circumstances have dictated why they have ended up in this situation. The Tennessee Titans have a critical game coming up next week. They play the Jacksonville Jaguars, with both teams tied with a 7-8 record. Even if the Titans lose this week, they will only be one game behind going into next week if Jacksonville wins.        Defeating the Jaguars will clinch the division for them. So this game is basically a free hit for them.            Then there is the situation where Ryan Tannehill has been placed on injured reserve. This means that they do not expect him to be back either next week or deep into the playoffs (if they get there). So it comes down to Joshua Dobbs and Malik Willis. They need both their quarterbacks to be familiar with the offense going into next week. Hence, it made a lot of sense for Dobbs to start in this game to get some action with the offense and familiarize himself.     Malik Willis is expected to be back next week Malik Willis is expected to return for the game next week against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Unless there is a mind-blowing performance by Joshua Dobbs this week, this situation is not expected to change going into next week. Jeremy Fowler@JFowlerESPNMy understanding of Titans‚Äô QB outlook for rest of the year *Team figured it doesnt hurt to get a look at what Josh Dobbs can do in a game that doesn‚Äôt hurt them in standings*Barring eye-opening performance from Dobbs, Malik Willis will most likely start vs. Jaguars12437 Malik Willis has not had the best of seasons, starting as the backup quarterback for Ryan Tannehill. He has not thrown for a single touchdown this season but has thrown three interceptions. This is not a good look for any quarterback.     Particularly concerning for the Titans was his performance last week against the Houston Texans. They played the worst team in the NFL and instead of breaking their losing streak, he threw for zero touchdowns and two interceptions. He finished with a 34.5 passer rating. Jordan Pun@Texans_ThoughtsThe Titans aren‚Äôt giving up on Malik Willis after 3 starts in which he only threw 49 total passes.That‚Äôs not a good enough sample size to evaluate anyone, especially a guy like Willis who is viewed as a project.They‚Äôre resting most of their starters for Week 18‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it.391 Next week, if he does play as he is expected to, he will come up against an ascendant Jacksonville Jaguars with the divisional top seed on the line. Facing him as the opposing quarterback will be Trevor Lawrence, who has started to show glimpses of his potential this season. If he has to prove himself, Malik Willis will have to do it with the season on the line.

Jones sought outside help from Alabama, which did not sit well with Belichick.  However, the hiring of Bill O'Brien as the new offensive coordinator has alleviated some of the tensions, given his prior relationships with both Jones and Belichick from their respective roles in New England and Alabama. Can the Patriots trade Mac Jones if he doesn't play well in 2023? While there have been discussions about the possibility of trading Jones if he does not perform well in 2023, it is unlikely due to the financial aspects involved. Trading Jones does not make sense from a financial standpoint, considering his contract will cost the Patriots less than $10 million over the next two years, which is relatively low compared to regular rookie contracts, especially for top picks. Jones still has two guaranteed years remaining on his contract, and the Patriots hold the option to activate a fifth year due to his first-round draft status. His cap hits for 2023 and 2024 are $4.25 million and $4.9 million, respectively.     "", ""Ranking the top 5 NFL free agents available\xa0  Free agency has passed and the 2022 NFL Draft has been and gone. The biggest names, the sought-after players, the ones that command hefty price tags, have all found their homes for the upcoming season. While the most obvious names are now gone, that doesn‚Äôt mean there aren't any options still available out there.  There are veteran stars coming off a few bad seasons, these last year's men are desperate to relive their glory days. Not to mention injury-riddled players, defiant to the very end and determined to make a comeback.        Here are the best five NFL free agents left on the market:           #5. Julio Jones The market value of Julio Jones should not entirely be tied to the performance of quarterback Ryan Tannehill. After dominating the NFL for a decade as a member of the Atlanta Falcons, Jones was a monster when he had Matt Ryan throwing him the ball. Granted, in his final year, he did slow down. However, once he arrived in Tennessee, Jones was a shell of his former self. NFL Stats@NFL_StatsActive players with the most career receiving yards‚Ä¶Julio Jones - 13,330Antonio Brown - 12,291DeSean Jackson - 11,110DeAndre Hopkins - 10,581AJ Green - 10,278TY Hilton - 9,691Mike Evans - 9,301Rob Gronkowski - 9,286Emmanuel Sanders - 9,245Travis Kelce - 9,00644854     In 2021, Jones registered career lows in receiving yards at 434 and yards per game at 43.4. Seldom did Jones have the ball thrown his way, he was targeted just 48 times. He caught only one touchdown pass off 31 receptions. He may have lost a step or two but Jones is still a big, physical receiver with great hands. His days of being the number one option might be over, but as a secondary receiver on a team with Super Bowl aspirations, Jones can fill in nicely. At the age of 33 he could be signed at a discount. #4. Will Fuller Miami Dolphins v Houston Texans     No player in the NFL, perhaps apart from Deshaun Watson, needs to rehabilitate their image quite like Will Fuller. During his brief yet wildly productive career, Fuller‚Äôs name has popped up on the injury report more than he would like. In 2020, he got through the majority of the season injury-free. Despite staying out of the medical tent, his season stats have an enormous asterisk on them due to a failed PED test. In his first season in a new destination, Fuller spent the vast majority of his time sequestered on the sidelines due to injuries. After playing in only two games, the Miami Dolphins let him go. The speedy receiver is currently languishing in the open market. Some teams will be apprehensive about signing Fuller to a deal. Is he past his injury woes? Was his PED suspension an honest mistake? Fuller won‚Äôt come with a hefty price tag. Super Bowl contending teams can get their hands on a receiver who‚Äôs more than capable of taking the top off a defense for minimal cost.     #3. Trey Flowers Indianapolis Colts v Detroit Lions Signing Trey Flowers to a massive deal wouldn‚Äôt be the wisest decision any NFL team has ever made. However, that isn‚Äôt because of his performance. When healthy, Flowers‚Äô has been one of the best defensive linemen in the league. But, therein lies the problem, ‚Äúwhen healthy.‚Äù Over the past two seasons, Flowers has missed more than half of the year due to countless injuries. While it appears as though his body is struggling with the rigors of the game, at 29, he should have plenty left in the tank.     From 2017 to 2019, Flowers was a menace up front, recording 21 sacks during that stretch for both the New England Patriots and the Detroit Lions. If he can stay healthy, he would be a steal for anyone willing to take a chance on him. #2. James Bradberry New York Giants v Los Angeles Chargers James Bradberry was the lone bright spot on a horrific New York Giants team in 2020 with 3 interceptions, 18 passes defended and 54 combined tackles. After nabbing his first NFL Pro Bowl appearance, Bradberry produced similar numbers in 2021 with 4 interceptions, 17 passes defended and 47 combined tackles.     Defensive players often find themselves at a disadvantage. With the NFL openly prioritizing offensive numbers, defenders can struggle to impact the game and don't often get the praise they deserve. Bradberry‚Äôs numbers should make him a salivating prospect for numerous teams, but when you add his durability, missing only two games in five years, Bradberry becomes incredibly valuable. #1. Odell Beckham Jr. NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Arizona Cardinals v Los Angeles Rams Undoubtedly, Odell Beckham Jr.‚Äôs long and seemingly perpetual injury history has scared off a number of suitors. Despite his otherworldly talents, Beckham Jr. has failed to record a thousand-yard season since 2019. Nevertheless, his mediocre numbers are also an indictment of poor quarterback play.     Neer Ray@NeerRayNFL@obj And I already know the comeback reel gonna be even tougher than the last one 16716 At the age of 29, Beckham Jr. is far from done as a top receiver in the NFL. Case in point would be his recent Super Bowl performance. Before crashing down to the turf in a heap, Beckham Jr. was well on his way to winning Super Bowl MVP, finishing the game with two catches, a touchdown score, and 53 yards. Odell Beckham Jr@objI will be back ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt kno when. Where. But I will. Be. Back‚Ä¶468523017Beckham Jr. has plenty left to offer in the NFL. Not just as a secondary receiver or a decoy but as a number one option in a playoff-bound squad. It‚Äôs unclear when he‚Äôll be able to play in 2022 but once he does return, whoever signs him could see their fortunes improve.     "", 'NFL fans troll Will Levis after Titans QB falls behind Malik Willis in QB2 battle - ""Levis may be really fu**ing bad""  Will Levis was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft. This marked the second time in as many years that the Titans selected a quarterback in the first three rounds of the draft. They took Malik Willis in the third round the year before, with each of them now joining struggling starter Ryan Tannehill.  Malik Willis clearly struggled during the 2022 NFL season in his rookie year. This factored heavily into the Titans\' decision to draft Will Levis. If they felt secure about the future of their quarterback position, they surely wouldn\'t have used another premium pick on a player in the same position.        While many believed the Titans were receiving an upgrade when they drafted Levis, that may not necessarily be the case. Recent reports indicate that Levis has fallen behind Willis on the Titans\' depth chart in the early stages of their 2023 NFL offseason programs.           Many fans were shocked by the report that maybe Will Levis isn\'t as strong a prospect as he was expected to be. Some of them went on Reddit to troll the rookie quarterback for falling behind the second-year player who has shown little promise so far.

Willis reportedly has put his best foot forward, including a strong practice on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Levis has gotten off to a bit of a slow start. in nfl      Malik Willis was projected to be a first-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, but ended up slipping all the way to Round 3 before eventually being selected by the Titans. His incredible athleticism made him an exciting prospect, but his major deficiencies throwing the football during his rookie season has severely hurt his outlook as a potential future starter. His unproven ability to be a pocket passer and relative lack of legitimate college football competition playing at Liberty are likely why he slipped all the way to the third round. His fall is somewhat justified by his ugly rookie performance. The alarming part about the Titans drafting Will Levis is that he also fell further down the draft board than most thought he would. Why did Will Levis fall in the 2023 NFL Draft? Will Levis     Will Levis was expected to go in the top 10 picks of the 2023 NFL Draft by most ""experts"" around the league. Several mock drafts even had him going as high as the No. 1 pick to the Carolina Panthers rather than Bryce Young. When it was all said and done, almost every one of these experts were wrong as Levis fell all the way out of the first round. The Titans made a move to trade up in the second round to select the falling Levis. Many rumors began circling that most teams shared a belief that his personality doesn\'t seem to fit the mold of an NFL quarterback. His college football tape also showed that he struggled to be a consistently accurate passer.    Nevertheless, the Titans took a shot on a quarterback apparently nobody else wanted for the second draft in a row. If nothing else, this clearly demonstrates their lack of faith in Ryan Tannehill retaining the starting job for much longer.     ', ""5 potential dark horses for the 2022 NFL MVP award  The NFL MVP award is routinely a quarterback competition since the turn of the millennium. Only one running back has won it in the last decade, and only four have won it overall since 2000.            In 2022, just who will be the NFL MVP is the million dollar question, and that is meant literally, given all of the incentives in a modern NFL contract.           Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterStarting in 2022, and for 10 years running, Patrick Mahomes has a $1.25 million incentive for winning AFC Championship game and a $1.25 million incentive for winning NFL MVP, per source. That‚Äôs $25M of incentives over 10 years, taking value of his deal from $477M to $503M.132922201 The Patrick Mahomes', Josh Allen's, and Joe Burrow's of the world will all be linked to the award, but this coming season sees a lot of quarterbacks finding new homes. Several established players could also see the time they put in with their franchise finally pay off. In either category, the potential to be a dark horse NFL MVP candidate is there.     Here are 5 potential dark horses for the 2022 NFL MVP award: Jalen Hurts has an improved Eagles wide receiver room Jalen Hurts The narrative for the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2022 season is whether or not the man under center will be enough to lead them to the playoffs. If Jalen Hurts can simply have a middle-of-the-pack performance, the Eagles will be NFC East contenders. They signed several championship-caliber players from the 2021 Georgia Bulldogs, who were added to their veteran-laden defense. If they can get an imporved performance from Hurts, an MVP award is not out of the question.     Miami Dolphin quarterback Tua Tagovaiola Tua Tagovaiola Tua Tagovaiola could already be nearly at the MVP level and we might not realize it. Tagovaiola has played just 21 games in his career, with last season being interrupted by a Week 1 rib fracture while facing the Buffalo Bills.        If he can finally stay on the field for 17 games, minus a pair at most, he could reach his potential at the professional level as an MVP contender. Mac Jones has the Bill Belichick machine backing him Mac Jones Mac Jones has had the most success in the NFL out of the quarterbacks on this list. He led the Patriots to an AFC wild card spot as a rookie after being selected in the first round of the 2021 draft. With Bill Belichick behind him, Jones can continue to carry the torch for an offense that was historic in the years preceding his arrival in New England.     Ryan Tannehill of the Tennessee Titans Ryan Tannehill While he doesn't get much MVP attention, Ryan Tannehill could be the Tennessee Titan to bring the award to the 'Music City'. Pickswise@PickswiseLook who is tied for a VERY EARLY favorite to win his third-straight MVP @CaesarsSports Aaron Rodgers +700Patrick Mahomes +700Josh Allen +900Joe Burrow +1200Justin Herbert +1400Matthew Stafford +1500Derrick Henry +1800292     Derrick Henry's legendary career has possibly seen its peak, but Tannehill, at age 33, is right at the age where some quarterbacks hit their form. The Titans are already at the top of the AFC, so a standout season from Tannehill could get him into that conversation. Matt Ryan has joined the Indianapolis Colts Matt Ryan Similar to Matt Stafford's situation in 2021, Matt Ryan has been traded from a perennially under-achieving, down-on-its-luck franchise to one with a championship infrastructure. Ryan will be joining a Colts offense that rolled out the red carpet for Carson Wentz last season, only to receive a moderate return. The long-time Falcons quarterback had a career completion percentage of 65.5% over 14 years and won an MVP award in 2016.A change of scenery could be the late-career refresher the 37-year-old may need to become an MVP candidate once again.

11,Joe Flacco,"[""Is Joe Flacco still playing football?  Joe Flacco had one of the strongest arms in football, and he used that strong arm to constantly drag the Baltimore Ravens into the postseason. A divisive topic in the NFL has always been whether Joe Flacco is good, great, or overrated. Depending on your side, there are compelling arguments for your point.  Flacco has been a member of the NFL for longer than some casual fans have been watching, so it's no surprise that they can't remember how good he was, especially when his back was against the wall. Joe Flacco was a true mentality monster. He added grit, grind, and talent to every franchise he suited up for. That being said, there's a question here that we need to answer.        New York Jets@nyjetsJOE FLACCO BABY105801486           Is Joe Flacco still playing football? Yes, Flacco is still playing football, and he was seen in Week 4 of the 2022 NFL season playing for the New York Jets. The Jets re-signed Flacco on a one-year deal to serve as the backup for their young quarterback, Zach Wilson.  When Wilson suffered an injury in Week 1 of the season, the Jets needed a seasoned vet to steady the ship. Queue in Flacco, who steadied the Jets pretty admirably.     So yes, Flacco is still playing football at the age of 37, which isn't that old considering his position as a quarterback. However, it's been five years since Flacco was an undisputed starter. You would have to rewind to his days as a Baltimore Raven (pre-Lamar Jackson) for when he was last a QB1. So maybe it's time to hang up the cleats, or maybe not. Joe Flacco has earned the right to make that decision. Action Network@ActionNetworkHQNFL Passing Yards Leaders1. Tua Tagovailoa: 7392. Carson Wentz: 6503. Joe Flacco: 616220292359 Why is Joe Flacco playing backup to Zach Wilson?     Joe Flacco is playing backup to Zach Wilson because Jets coaches believe that Zach Wilson is their quarterback of the future. That's the reason they drafted him so high, and they are in the process of building a team that can compete around his skillset. Strong arm Joe had his time, as he has been in the league for almost two decades, playing in some of the best games in league history. Hence, Flacco is playing backup to Zach Wilson because his time as a starter in the NFL seems to have expired. However, new York Jets coach Robert Saleh still has faith in Flacco, and who knows? Maybe he'll win back the starting spot from the pocket-sized competitor with time. Robert Estes@BreakfastCarrotIke Taylor summarizing Joe Flacco will always be funny to me. The man is Elite1458224     Joe Flacco's fantasy performance His fantasy football performance over the past decade has been topsy-turvy. The reason is that he has barely started football games since the Baltimore Ravens drafted Lamar Jackson. It's such a shame, as prime Flacco would have been an actual beast in today's NFL. He has all the tools, stats, and grit to be a fantasy football league legend. However, we are in 2022, and Flacco is warming the bench for a young Jets QB named Zach Wilson.

Wilson replied: ‚ÄúNo. Are you serious?"" In the 2017-2018 season, quarterbacks Josh McCown and Bryce Petty threw for a combined 60 yards versus the Denver Broncos in Week 14. All-time, the team has thrown for under 100 yards in 55 games.  Should Joe Flacco become the Jets starter for the rest of the season? While head coach Robert Saleh seems to be sticking with Zach Wilson, the numbers show that the team has played better under Joe Flacco.

It\'s time to win the games we should win."" Wilson has thrown for under 200 yards passing in a game this season four times, including the loss versus the Patriots. He also hasn\'t thrown a touchdown in four of his last five starts, which was the case against the Patriots. In Week Nine against the Jets, the former BYU star had his lone game with a passer rating of over 100 (101.8 versus the Buffalo Bills).

He performed admirably in Week 8's matchup with the New England Patriots. Conklin was targeted ten times while playing the majority of the day while trailing. In the defeat, he hauled in six catches for 79 yards and two touchdowns. This was his greatest performance since joining the team.  If you don't have Mark Andrews or Travis Kelce on your team, tight end is probably the toughest spot in fantasy football for you to find a regular producer. Conklin is worth a pickup in some leagues, even though he's expected to have some off days. Part of his problem is that the Jets utilize a run-heavy offense. For those trying to navigate injuries or bye weeks, Conklin is a reliable streaming option.        Harrison Glaser@NYJetsTFMediaTyler Conklin had his biggest game since being on the #Jets today 79 yards 13.2 yards per catch 2 TDs18           Week 9's game against the Buffalo Bills will probably be a pass-heavy one, as the game-script is likely going to favor the Bills. Thus, Conklin could have another high-volume game. Considering the above, we recommend starting Tyler Conklin in Week 9. Tyler Conklin's season thus far New York Jets v Green Bay Packers     For Conklin, this season has been one of peaks and valleys. With Joe Flacco running the Jets' offense, he started the year by producing respectable fantasy numbers. However, Conklin's statistics have significantly decreased following Zach Wilson's return in Week 4. The tight end has caught 32 passes for 309 yards and three touchdowns this season. He has proven that when targeted he can deliver and deserves a greater number of looks than he normally receives. It will be interesting to see if quarterback Zach Wilson starts to utilize his tight end more as the season progresses.In a Week 9 matchup against the Buffalo Bills, the New York Jets will likely have to score a lot of points to stay in the game. Tyler Conklin should benefit if the Jets keep throwing the ball frequently in this upcoming game.     "", 'carson wentz: 5 NFL QBs who could be out of the league after 2023 feat.

Here are the quarterbacks who might have played their last snap during the 2022 NFL season. The possibility of getting another contract is dwindling as their recent performances indicate it‚Äôs time to go. They‚Äôve had their time, but the game will move on without them in pads and uniforms. Which 5 NFL quarterbacks could be out of the league in ahead of the 2023 season? 5. Joe Flacco Baltimore Ravens fans were surprised when Joe Flacco became the 18th overall selection in the 2008 NFL Draft. Aside from playing for a small school, Flacco even asked his coach to play baseball because he was not confident about his prospects. But the University of Delaware alumnus brought stability to a position where the Ravens struggled to find long-term solutions.     Flockville@FlockvilleWelp, with Lamar Jackson asking to be traded out of Baltimore so he doesn‚Äôt have to play with the #Ravens anymore‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs only 3 words for #RavensFlock.RUN. IT. BACK.Joe Flacco is Elite.Time for One Last Ride. 22227 He became the team‚Äôs starting quarterback for 11 seasons, winning Super Bowl XLVII and taking MVP honors. But since then, he has bounced around the league, suiting up for the Denver Broncos, Philadelphia Eagles, and New York Jets (twice). He took over from Zach Wilson in five games in the 2022 season but won only one game. There are better options at quarterback than the 38-year-old Flacco. 4. Josh Johnson NFC Championship - San Francisco 49ers v Philadelphia Eagles     Josh Johnson was also selected in the 2008 draft, 142 spots after Flacco. He‚Äôs a journeyman who has suited up for 14 NFL teams in 15 seasons. He also played for the Los Angeles Wildcats for one XFL season. Johnson had his fourth stint with the San Francisco 49ers in 2022 and played two games.  He played in the NFC Championship Game after Brock Purdy suffered an injury but was also checked out due to a concussion. SportsCenter@SportsCenterBrock Purdy is back in at QB for the 49ers after this hit on Josh Johnson.2906134 He finished the game with seven completions for 74 yards. Johnson also appeared in two regular-season games but had only one completion and three rushing yards. Seeing him get another opportunity is challenging, given that he is already 36. Likewise, the 49ers signed Sam Darnold to compete with Purdy and Trey Lance.     3. Chase Daniel Los Angeles Chargers v Arizona Cardinals Chase Daniel was a highly-touted quarterback coming out of college after throwing for 12,515 yards and 101 touchdowns as a University of Missouri starter. Unfortunately, the two-time Heisman Trophy finalist went undrafted in 2009. Daniel eventually joined the New Orleans Saints after spending time in the Washington Commanders\' practice squad. The 33rd Team@The33rdTeamFB.@ChaseDaniel weighs in on the Lamar Jackson news, and why he has ""mixed emotions"" on the former MVP\'s trade request ‚öñÔ∏è353     He has had a fulfilling career, even though he has only started five games in 14 seasons. Aside from winning Super Bowl XLIV with the Saints, Chase Daniel also has estimated career earnings of $41 million. He appeared in four games for the Los Angeles Chargers last season, throwing for 52 yards and a touchdown. But with Easton Stick being Justin Herbert\'s backup, Daniel might have seen the end of his playing career. 2. Matt Ryan Houston Texans v Indianapolis Colts Despite his release in March, the 2016 NFL Most Valuable Player will still get $12 million from the Indianapolis Colts. Credit his agent, Tom Condon, for negotiating that caveat into his contract. While he will still receive financial rewards, Matt Ryan faltered in his attempt to lead the Colts to the playoffs.      He has only won four of the 12 regular-season games he started, finishing with 14 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Barstool Indy@barstoolindyThe Matt Ryan Era in Indy is officially over. We‚Äôll never forget The Run, Matty Ice \U0001fae11417127 If this is the end for Ryan, he has built credentials worthy of consideration for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Aside from being a league MVP, he was an Offensive Player of the Year and Offensive Rookie of the Year awardee. Ryan also has one All-Pro distinction and four Pro Bowl selections. He must accept a backup role to keep getting game checks.     1. Carson Wentz Cleveland Browns v Washington Commanders Ironically, Wentz was the Colts‚Äô starting quarterback before Ryan. The Commanders traded for him, hoping to get a quarterback who showed more promise earlier in his NFL career. But he ended up starting seven games, winning only two. Head coach Ron Rivera named him the starter in their must-win Week 17 match against the Cleveland Browns. Sadly, he played poorly, putting Washington out of playoff contention. Moody@EricNMoody‚ÄúWashington released QB Carson Wentz.‚ÄùThe Commanders see big things for Sam Howell.Carson Wentz right now:39351 The Commanders had seen enough and released Wentz after the 2022 NFL season. After failing in two opportunities as a starting quarterback, he would have to take a significant salary cut if he wanted to keep playing. But getting another contract isn‚Äôt up to him because it looks like he has given everything he can as a player. He‚Äôd be lucky if an NFL team came calling, considering his recent struggles.     ', 'Are Philadelphia Eagles still unsure about QB Jalen Hurts? Philadelphia trades for Jacksonville QB Gardner Minshew  The Philadelphia Eagles may have made a very underrated roster move by acquiring QB Garnder Minshew from the Jacksonville Jaguars, adding to a roster with Jalen Hurts and Joe Flacco already in place. Gardner Minshew lost a QB ""battle"" that he was never seriously going to win against the number one overall pick Trevor Lawrence. Minshew was a breakout star in 2019 when he took over for Nick Foles. In 2020, he struggled on the field with a lingering hand injury that impacted his performance. The Jaguars drafted Lawrence, a generational talent, and it was just a matter of time before they traded Gardner Minshew as he wasn\'t going to unseat Trevor Lawrence any time soon.  Trade: #Eagles have acquired QB Gardner Minshew from Jacksonville in exchange for a conditional sixth-round pick in 2022. The team also released QB Nick Mullens. pic.twitter.com/MLYrJfymxE‚Äî Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) August 28, 2021        Gardner Minshew trade shows uncertainty with Jalen Hurts...and Jacksonville Jaguars head coach?           Enter the Philadelphia Eagles, who have been in deep thought on what Jalen Hurts\' future holds with the team. Through three NFL preseason games, Jalen Hurts saw action only in Week 1 as the starter (3/7 for 54 yards). QB Joe Flacco played most of the preseason and played well, too. Philadelphia seems to be hinting to Jalen Hurts that his time as a starter could be in jeopardy by offering a sixth-round pick for Gardner Minshew. So yes, the Philadelphia Eagles are still not sold on Jalen Hurts being the face of their franchise. That doesn\'t mean he\'ll be benched immediately for Flacco or Minshew, who is #3 on the depth chart. The team does have options at QB now though, if injury, COVID-19, or regression strikes Jalen Hurts. Flacco had a great preseason and showed he can still perform with success in the NFL, but he\'s not suited to lead Nick Sirianni\'s offense. It requires a smaller, more mobile and athletic player and that has never been Joe Flacco. Gardner Minshew, on the other hand, looks like a prime candidate for such a system. The Eagles do not know if he\'ll be more like the 2019 or 2020 Gardner Minshew, though. It would be smart not to give Minshew responsibilities on the offense before he earns them.     Eagles just landed a 25-year old QB that has completed 62.9% with 37 TD, only 11 INT, and 93.1% rating in his first two seasons for a stinking 6th round pick. Gardner Minshew is a winning NFL quarterback. Absolute no-brainer deal for Howie Roseman.‚Äî Jim Nagy (@JimNagy_SB) August 28, 2021 Jacksonville dropped the ball with Gardner Minshew Giving up a sixth-round pick for a QB with 5,530 passing yards and 37 passing TDs in two years is a steal and says more about the dysfunction and uncertainty in Jacksonville than Philadelphia. The so-called QB competition seemed like an act to boost Minshew\'s trade value, which failed obviously and leaves HC Urban Meyer to be criticized for such a move. Still, Philadelphia does well to have extra options at QB, something they\'ve been known to do over the years.     Despite playing 13 less full games, Jalen Hurts had more 300+ passing yard performances than Baker Mayfield.In Hurts‚Äô 3 game stretch of full starts, he also averaged more YPG, TD per game, and had a higher Comp %.#Eagles pic.twitter.com/mpF8OkEpb4‚Äî Eagles Nation (@PHLEaglesNation) August 23, 2021 Jalen Hurts has potential, but needs to utilize it early in 2021 Jalen Hurts is still just 23 with only four career starts, even though it may feel he\'s played more than that. A 1-3 record isn\'t great and neither is a 52% completion rate, 6 TDs, and four INTs. The upside is that he\'s shown he can lead, the offense respects him, and he\'s had 300+ yards in two of his four starts. He\'s played much better in training camp, but he really needed the reps in the preseason regardless of the Eagles wanting to rest him to prevent an injury. Jalen Hurts\' small amount of playing time in his career isn\'t large enough to really allow him to have a long leash as a starter and he will be under the microscope. While Gardner Minshew\'s arrival isn\'t a formal answer to Jalen Hurts losing his starting job, it does prove the Eagles feel they need to have suitable options on the depth chart. Don\'t bet on Philadelphia having a winning season in 2021.     ', '‚ÄúZach Wilson says cougar hunting is easier‚Äù ‚Äì Shannon Sharpe Twitter burn puts Jets QB on blast after horror TNF loss vs Jaguars  Zach Wilson and the New York Jets suffered their fourth straight loss as they lost 3-19 to the Jacksonville Jaguars. This was another devastating loss for the Jets, whose playoff ambitions have fallen apart.  Wilson once again played poorly and was benched by the Jets in the second half of the game. Chris Streveler came in to replace him, but the Jets weren\'t able to change the outcome of the result.                     In light of another terrible performance from Wilson, many trolled the New York Jets quarterback. NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe also chimed in to take a subtle dig at Wilson. Here\'s what Sharpe tweeted about Zach Wilson after his awful performance against the Jacksonville Jaguars: ""Zach Wilson says cougar hunting is easier than playing qb in the NFL. Son, you‚Äôve gotta do better than this"" shannon sharpe@ShannonSharpeZach Wilson says cougar hunting is easier than playing qb in the NFL.

Unfortunately, the former BYU quarterback hasn\'t been able to showcase his skills on the field this season. It is highly probable that the loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars was his last-ever start for the Jets, as the franchise will look to use the other quarterbacks on their roster. Due to their four-game losing streak, New York will head into their next game against the Seattle Seahawks as the underdogs.       Is the Zach Wilson era over in New York? Zach Wilson: Detroit Lions v New York Jets As stated earlier, the game against the Jaguars might have been the last start for Wilson in New York. The team clearly plays better with other quarterbacks than with Wilson. As a result, the Jets will look to play with Joe Flacco or Chris Streveler if Mike White isn\'t healthy. nick wright@getnickwrightIt‚Äôs absolutely amazing that the *moment* literally ANY quarterback other than Zach Wilson plays for the Jets their offense markedly improves.4502289     Jets head coach Robert Saleh has stated that this isn\'t the end of Wilson in New York, but it\'s really hard to see him continuing. Against the Jaguars, Wilson finished the game by completing 9/18 throws for 92 yards and an interception. He had a passer rating of 41.9. Ari Meirov@MySportsUpdate#Jets HC Robert Saleh said they didn\'t intend to bench Zach Wilson tonight. The goal was to get the run game going by bringing in Chris Streveler -- and they eventually opted to stick with him once they realized the offense got a spark. ""We haven\'t see the last of him [Zach].""197575New York looked primed to make the playoffs, but the injury to Mike White has derailed their chances of making it to the postseason. Wilson had the opportunity to redeem himself, but he failed. It will be interesting to see what\'s next for both Zach Wilson and the New York Jets.     ', ""Tom Brady's biggest playoff loss: Cowboys en route to creating history  Tom Brady is the final boss in the NFL playoffs. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers superstar has made it to ten Super Bowls in his career and won seven. He holds almost every, if not every, playoff quarterback record. He holds the record for the most wins, most passing yards, most passing touchdowns, and most Super Bowl MVPs.  Of Brady's 13 playoff losses, seven have been by one score. However, like almost every great quarterback, he has been on the receiving end of some embarrassing playoff losses.        Here are the five biggest playoff losses of his career:           Tom Brady's five Biggest Playoff losses #5 - Patriots 16-26 Broncos, 2013 AFC Championship Game - 10 Points AFC Championship - New England Patriots v Denver Broncos The soon-to-be NFL MVP Peyton Manning put on a clinic against Brady and the Patriots at Mile High and beat them by 10 points to advance to Super Bowl 48. Manning threw for 400 yards and two touchdowns and helped the Broncos build a 20-3 lead by the end of the third quarter. Brady and the Patriots tried to rally back and outscored the Broncos 13-6 in the fourth quarter, but it was too little, too late.     #4 - Patriots 13-27 Broncos, 2005 AFC Divisional Round - 14 points Brady's first playoff loss also came against the Broncos in the 2005 AFC Divisional round. Quarterback Jake Plummer threw for 197 yards and one touchdown while running back Mike Anderson rushed for 69 yards and two touchdowns to end the Patriots' dream of a Super Bowl three-peat.

Ravens' Willis McGahee and Le'Ron McClain also rushed for one touchdown each in a dominating rushing display.     The Ravens' defense was also on song, holding Brady to 154 passing yards and two touchdowns with three interceptions.     "", 'Why was Zach Wilson benched? What did he say in the Week 11 postgame conference?  Zach Wilson was the starting quarterback for the New York Jets for seven games this season. He led the team to five wins, including a Week 9, 20-17 win against the Buffalo Bills. Under his leadership, the Jets lost two games, both of which were against the New England Patriots.  Wilson had a poor performance in the Week 11 defeat to their AFC East rival, and followed it up with a disastrous press conference. As a result, head coach Robert Saleh announced he was benching Wilson in favor of Mike White.        Wilson was roundly criticized for his refusal to take accountability for a poor offensive display, while the Jets defense limited the Patriots to three points all game. New England won the game 10-3 in the final seconds on a punt return touchdown.           In the postgame interview, a reporter asked Wilson if he felt he had let the defense down. His response was simple: ""No."" Watch the video below, as it was as much his body language as what he said:         So was it entirely that comment that led to his benching, or was there more to the story? Zach Wilson\'s 2022 NFL season stats and Week 12 performance Zach Wilson - New York Jets v Carolina Panthers The Jets have been impressive this season, but Wilson can\'t take too much credit for their change in fortunes. Although they were winning games, they were looking stagnant on offense and some of the issues had to be shouldered by Zach Wilson. It\'s important to note that a season-ending injury to Breece Hall was a major factor in their offensive downturn, but Wilson really didn\'t help himself either.     The Jets entered the regular season with Joe Flacco under center as Wilson suffered a knee injury in the preseason matchup with the Philadelphia Eagles. Flacco went 1-2 before Wilson was ready to play against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 4. Wilson brought the Jets into the limelight as they won their next four games. However, in Week 8, the Patriots defeated the Jets 22-17. Zach Wilson completed only 20 of the 41 passes he attempted. He threw for 355 yards and had two touchdown passes and three interceptions. Those turnovers proved too much for the Jets to overcome.        Following a narrow win over the Buffalo Bills and a bye week, the Jets fell to a disappointing 3-10 loss against the Patriots in Week 11. Wilson completed 9 of 22 passes for 77 yards and the offense gained just two yards after halftime. It was the worst performance of his career and this, along with his postgame comments, caused him to be benched for Week 12 against the Chicago Bears. You might also like - When can college football players go to the NFL? This season, Zach Wilson has thrown for 1,279 yards, four touchdowns and five interceptions. As the Jets believe they can compete with the best of teams this year, they felt a change was required to push them forward. Zach Wilson apologized for his Week 11 comments Wilson later apologized for his comments, saying: ‚ÄúI wanted the opportunity to talk to those guys, really make it from the heart... It\'s deserved (the criticism), the way that I handled the situation wasn\'t right and I\'ve got to be a better football player and I\'ve got to be a better leader for these guys...""         Wilson spoke to the entire team on Wednesday, admitting his poor performance in the game. He also said that he is not here to play as a backup quarterback and will do whatever he can to re-claim the starting job for the team. Meanwhile, Mike White started Sunday\'s game against the Chicago Bears and led the team to a 31-10 victory. White impressed everyone with his game by completing 22 of 28 for 315 yards and throwing three touchdown passes.     The question remains as to whether the will Jets give Zach Wilson another chance to prove himself.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Newyorkjets.com and H/T Sportskeeda.

Mike White\'s stranglehold on the football-loving public\'s imagination is over, as the New York Jets announced that they would start Joe Flacco for their Sunday contest against the Miami Dolphins (1 p.m. ET, CBS). White put in a literal Hall of Fame performance on Oct. 31 against the Cincinnati Bengals, becoming the first NFL quarterback to throw for 400 yards and three touchdowns in his first career start.

Many would probably expect legends like Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, George Blanda, and Y.A. Tittle to appear on the list. Others, like Nick Foles and Joe Kapp, were able to carve professional football legacies beyond their high-scoring affairs but the addition of Adrian Burk is one that will certainly raise eyebrows among non-football historians.     Burk was the second overall pick of the 1950 NFL Draft but spent a relatively uneventful seven seasons with the Colts and Eagles. But an October 1954 afternoon with the latter helped him make history, as he threw seven touchdowns on only 27 attempts in a 49-21 win over Washington, becoming the first to earn that historic tally. That triumph was one of only 15 victories Burk would earn as a starter in his NFL career. Despite his history in a helmet, Burk is perhaps better known for his officiating endeavors as a back judge. Ironically, he was present when Kapp pulled off the feat in 1969. Burk was also part of the officiating crew for Franco Harris\' Immaculate Reception during the 1972-73 playoffs.

A 41-34 win for the Cleveland Browns over the Kansas City Chiefs featured over 900 yards of offense, 286 of which came from Browns running back Jerome Harrison. Harrison\'s tally was good for the third-best single-game rushing tally in NFL history. To put that in perspective, Harrison tallied only 301 total over the first 13 games of the 2008 season. That was enough for Cleveland to bring him back on a new contract and grant him the top rushing duties for the following season. Alas, Harrison was traded to Philadelphia in October of the following year. He was nearly sent back to the Eagles after signing with Detroit over the offseason, but he failed his physical after Philadelphia doctors discovered a brain tumor. Some expected Harrison to be a quadraplegic after the ordeal, but he has since regained most of his motor skills through a rigorous recovery process.     Flynn (10) threw for 480 yards in a 45-41 win (Photo: Getty) 1/1/12: Flynn the Money The NFL history of the Green Bay Packers has been written by aerial legends: Bart Starr, Brett Favre, Aaron Rodgers, and...Matt Flynn??? Titletown\'s single-game record for passing yards and touchdowns is held by Flynn, a seventh-round pick of the Packers in the 2008 draft. Flynn had made a single start entering Week 17 of the 2011-12 NFL season, when he was called upon to relieve a resting Rodgers before the top-seeded Packers began their playoff trek. Despite the relative lack of stakes, Flynn wowed audiences with a 480-yard, six-touchdown showing as the Packers earned a 45-41 victory over the Detroit Lions.     Flynn\'s output was enough to convince the Seattle Seahawks to shell out the big bucks: a three-year, $20.5 million contract awaited in the ensuing offseason, along with the implication that Flynn was the team\'s new franchise man. Alas for Flynn, the drafting of a third-round pick named Russell Wilson changed everything. He lasted only two more seasons in the NFL after that, a stretch that included a return to Green Bay in 2013-14. Gray scores one of his four touchdowns in the win over the Colts (Photo: Getty) 11/16/14: Gray Matter It has become a tiring NFL cliche/meme to say that Bill Belichick can win with anyone. But that axiom rang dangerously true during a November 2014 prime-time contest between Belichick\'s New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts.     With regular rushers Stevan Ridley and LeGarrette Blount unavailable, the Patriots bestowed their duties on Gray. That Sunday night\'s showdown against the Colts was the one-month anniversary of his promotion to the Patriots\' active roster. He went on to torch the Colts for 201 rushing yards and four scores, becoming the first player in the NFL\'s modern era to earn a touchdown quartet after entering the game with none. New England would win the game 42-20 and Gray earned cover duties for the ensuing week\'s issue of Sports Illustrated. Alas, Belichick giveth and Belichick taketh away: Gray took the costliest nap of his life during the ensuing week of practice, as his oversleeping made him late for practice after his phone died. Gray was originally suspended for a ""violation of team rules"" after the incident, but wound up being a healthy scratch in all but four of the Patriots\' remaining games that season. He was released by the Patriots at the end of training camp in 2015 and failed to catch on in Miami or Jacksonville.

The 2023 NFL season is now under two months away, which also means the return of NFL Fantasy is just around the corner.  Millions of fans across the world spend hours deliberating who to draft for their fantasy squads for the upcoming season, as they try to rank the league\'s superstars by position.        There is tons of wide receiver talent in the NFL currently, and the majority of them are also studs when it comes to fantasy.           For reference, all fantasy point scoring mentioned in this post will be the 1-point PPR scoring method. 2023 Fantasy Football: Top 10 wide receiver rankings #10 - Garrett Wilson         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post New York Jets WR Garrett Wilson is heading into year two with much higher prospects than a year ago. Wilson managed to put up 215.7 PPR points in 2022, with Joe Flacco, Mike White, and Zach Wilson throwing him the ball.     However, Wilson has a new QB in Aaron Rodgers, who is a monumental upgrade over the aforementioned. Wilson is Rodgers\' new WR1 and the pair will be hoping to strike an immediate rapport, much like Rodgers and his old teammate Davante Adams. #9 - Amon-Ra St. Brown         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post The Detroit Lions were one of the feel-good stories of the 2022 season, as they came from nowhere to almost sneak into the playoffs with their \'smashmouth\' football under likeable HC Dan Campbell.     Amon-Ra St. Brown was one of the surprises of the season, racking up 267.6 fantasy points, the 7th most in the league at the position. St. Brown will be looking for a repeat in 2023, and the Lions often find themselves in shootouts, so expect Amon-Ra to be high up in fantasy scoring once again. #8 - A.J. Brown         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Philadelphia Eagles star WR A.J. Brown helped his team make it all the way to the Super Bowl in 2022, as he put up 299.6 fantasy points across the regular season.     Brown now goes into his second season linking up with quarterback Jalen Hurts, and the big-play threat of Brown should make him a solid draft choice for your fantasy team. #7 - CeeDee Lamb         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Ceedee Lamb was excellent in 2022, linking up brilliantly with QB Dak Prescott. Lamb amassed 301.6 PPR points across the year, ranking fifth in the entire NFL. Prescott has relied heavily on Lamb, and outside of Brandin Cooks, he has little in the way of competition, so expect him to be in the upper echelons of fantasy football in 2023.     #6 - Davante Adams         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Davante Adams ranked as the third best wide receiver in fantasy football in 2022, ending the year with 335.5 fantasy points in his first year with the Las Vegas Raiders. Adams remains dominant and one of the best WRs in the NFL, but the Raiders replaced Adams\' close friend Derek Carr with Jimmy Garoppolo during the offseason and there\'s no guarantee the two will tandem as well as Adams and Carr. The Raiders also have the second toughest schedule in 2023 according to sharpfootballanalysis.com, so this is something to be aware of.     2023 Fantasy Football: Top 10 wide receiver rankings #5 - Cooper Kupp         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post After missing the majority of the 2022 season through injury, many fans forgot how dominant Cooper Kupp was when he won the \'Triple Crown\' back in 2021. Kupp led all WRs in yards, touchdowns and receptions as he formed an instant relationship with Matthew Stafford, one which culminated in the Los Angeles Rams winning the Super Bowl. Kupp ended 2021 with a monstrous 439.5 fantasy points, over 100 clear of any other WR this year.     Health is, of course, the main concern when drafting Kupp as his ankle injury side-lined him for most of 2022, while Stafford also missed time with a spinal cord injury. #4 - Stefon Diggs         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post On week 1 of the 2022 NFL season, Buffalo Bills wideout Stefon Diggs declared \'I\'m him\', after blasting past Jalen Ramsey for a score in the Bills\' 31-10 win over the defending Super Bowl champs Rams. Diggs was \'him\' in 2022, totalling 321.2 fantasy points across the year as he formed a lethal duo with QB Josh Allen.     Allen\'s huge arm and Diggs speed and elusiveness left defenses in their wake all year, and expect them to pick up where they left off if they can overcome their argument on the Bills sideline during their playoff exit against the Cincinnati Bengals. Dov Kleiman@NFL_DovKleimanThe last time the #Bills saw Stefon Diggs he was yelling at Josh Allen on the sideline of a playoff loss to the #Bengals Diggs signed a new deal last offseason, so skipping camp is more likely to do with the team than his contract.twitter.com/NFL_DovKleiman‚Ä¶Dov Kleiman@NFL_DovKleimanùó®ùóΩùó±ùóÆùòÅùó≤: #Bills WR Stefon Diggs is NOT in mandatory minicamp.Coach Sean McDermott says he\'s: ""Very concerned.""(via @JoeBuscaglia)4784491 #3 - Tyreek Hill         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Many questions were asked of Tyreek Hill when he moved from Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs to Tua Tagovailoa and the Miami Dolphins. Hill answered those questions, and then some as he had 341.2 fantasy points in an outstanding 2022 season. Hill had an immediate connection with Tua, one that was only hindered when the quarterback faced various health concerns throughout the year. If Tagovailoa can remain healthy all year, expect him, Hill and Jaylen Waddle form one of the most electrifying offenses in football. #2 - Ja\'Marr Chase         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Cincinnati Bengals WR Ja\'Marr Chase ranked 11th overall in fantasy scoring in 2022 despite missing four games through injury and having a game suspended against the Buffalo Bills in the wake of Damar Hamlin\'s heart attack. Chase was as good as his rookie year when on the field, seamlessly linking up with his former college QB Joe Burrow. Burrow took a step forward in 2022, and expect the same of a healthy Chase in this insane Bengals offense. Who had the most fantasy points as a WR last year? #1 - Justin Jefferson         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Minnesota Vikings WR Justin Jefferson had the most fantasy points as a WR in 2022, amassing 368.7 PPR points across an outstanding 2022 season. Jefferson built on his rapport with QB Kirk Cousins and was the clear WR1 for Minnesota, ahead of Adam Thielen and K.J. Osborn. Jefferson remains by far and away the best wide receiver in football, and until anyone can challenge him on that, he will likely be the best fantasy WR in 2023. PFF@PFF1. Justin Jefferson2.

NFL fans have been treated to a number of great games during the first week of the preseason. All five of the top quarterbacks in the 2021 NFL draft were on display. Justin Fields put on the best performance of all five rookie quarterbacks selected.        The Denver Broncos, surprisingly, had a phenomenal day on Saturday against the Vikings, putting up 33 points. Dwayne Haskins has seemed to figure things out with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The forgotten Jake Fromm led the Buffalo Bills to a game-winning field goal against the Detroit Lions.           These are just some of the many talking points that will carry over into Week 2 of the NFL preseason. With one game on the books for Sunday, let's take a look at what's in store for fans.

Stroud?  C.J. Stroud is one of the top prospects in the 2023 NFL Draft and is surely on the Indianapolis Colts‚Äô radar.  The Ohio State quarterback has been nothing less than spectacular during his two years as a starter. In 2021, he recorded 4,435 passing yards, 44 touchdowns, and six interceptions. This season, he has posted 3,340 yards, 37 touchdowns, and only six interceptions. In both seasons, he finished in the top four in Heisman voting.

While many of those guys go on to become stars at the next level, quarterbacks from that school just don‚Äôt tend to pan out for some reason. Drafted by the Baltimore Colts fourth overall in 1982, former Buckeye Art Schlichter played only 13 NFL games and is now known as one of the biggest draft busts of all time.     We\'ve also seen tons of other Buckeye QB legends like Troy Smith‚Äîthe last player from the school to win the Heisman Trophy‚ÄîBobby Hoying, Cardale Jones, Dwayne Haskins, and J.T.

However, Justin Fields just might‚Äôve broken the ‚ÄúOhio State Quarterback Curse.‚Äù The current Chicago Bears star, who‚Äôs in his second pro season, has over 1,000 rushing yards this year, as he has joined Michael Vick and Lamar Jackson as the only quarterbacks in NFL history to accomplish such a feat.

Future franchise quarterback in Indy? Ohio State\'s C.J. Stroud a frustrating 4-10-1 record, the Colts are clearly one of the worst teams in the league right now. They must address several areas, such as the offensive line, but their biggest need is a young, franchise quarterback who they can build around for many years to come. With a frustrating 4-10-1 record, the Colts are clearly one of the worst teams in the league right now. They must address several areas, such as the offensive line, but their biggest need is a young, franchise quarterback who they can build around for many years to come.     Since Andrew Luck retired in 2019, the Colts have added veterans like Philip Rivers, Carson Wentz, and now Matt Ryan this season. But none of those guys has been the long-term answer in Indianapolis.Stroud could certainly become the piece Indy has needed since Luck left town. He has loads of potential and is a pure pocket passer who possesses great overall accuracy. While it may take a few years to develop, Stroud could return the Colts to relevance in the not-so-distant future.     ', ""3 best Ohio State Quarterbacks to play in the NFL  Ohio State University is historically one of the top college football programs in the country. Every year they send several players to the NFL Draft and many of them have gone on to have great success at the professional level.   Quarterbacks don't necessarily fit that same narrative.        Ohio State has had plenty of great college quarterbacks in school history but they have not found the same success at the NFL level. Eleven Ohio State quarterbacks have made it to the NFL with a combined 79-99-1 career records as starters.            Nine of the eleven have thrown more interceptions than touchdowns in their NFL careers. The current lone NFL starting quarterback from Ohio State University is trying to shed the label. He wants to prove that their success in college can translate to the professional stage.  He is one of the three greatest Ohio State quarterbacks of all time and could eventually be the first to be elite in the NFL. Top 3 Ohio State quarterbacks of all time that made it to the NFL #3 - Dwayne Haskins Ohio State University quarterback Dwayne Haskins     Dwayne Haskins was the starting quarterback at Ohio State for just one year in 2018 but it was the best statistical season in the school's history. He set the Buckeyes' single-season all-time record in passing yards, total yards, completion percentage and passing touchdowns.  He also set a Big Ten Conference record with 4,831 passing yards and 50 passing touchdowns. Joe Dempsey@joedempsey44C.J.

He started 16 games over two seasons, completing just 60 percent of his passes with 12 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.      He is now a back-up quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers. #2 - Troy Smith Ohio State University quarterback Troy Smith Troy Smith was the last player from Ohio State to win the Heisman Trophy in 2006, college football's greatest individual honor. It is also the last time a player from the Big Ten Conference won the award.  Smith did so by completing 65 percent of his passes for 2,542 passing yards and throwing 44 of his 54 career passing touchdowns. Troy Smith never ended up being productive as an NFL quarterback. He started just eight games across four seasons with the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers.      He completed just 52 percent of his career passes. #1 - Justin Fields Ohio State University quarterback Justin Fields In two years as a starter at Ohio State, Justin Fields had an incredible 20-2 overall record. He never lost a regular-season game, with both losses coming in the College Football Playoffs.  His 2019 season set a new school record for passer rating at 181.4 and his 63 touchdown passes are the second most in school history.

At college football icon Mike Leach\'s funeral ceremony on Tuesday, Gardner Minshew spoke to the gathering and even dropped an f-bomb while paying tribute to his old coach.  Gardner Minshew, the backup quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles, missed walk-through practice on Tuesday to give a speech at Mike Leach\'s funeral service, wherein he and numerous others recalled the seasoned coach with affection.        Despite their brief time around each other, Minshew\'s single campaign of playing for Mike Leach at Washington State significantly influenced him.           syd@sydney_wickerA closer look at the memorabilia in front of the stage. USC head coach Lincoln Riley is here and is set to give a tribute. Bob Stoops and Gardner Minshew expected to have a tribute as well. QB Will Rogers and LB Nathaniel Watson will speak for MSU.@WTOKTV11619 Addressing the crowd at the funeral at Humphrey Coliseum on the Mississippi State school grounds, Minshew remarked, ""Probably my favorite thing about being a coach is that absolute courage of just being yourself, and I think that\'s one of the things that he rubbed off on me."" ""And man, my life and football outside of it ‚Äî that\'s one of the biggest blessings and lessons I\'ve learned,"" he continued.     Ross Dellenger of Sports Illustrated quoted Minshew as saying, ""He genuinely didn\'t care and gave a f‚Äîk what others thought."" From 2012 through 2019, Mike Leach served as a coach at Washington State. Due to difficulties from a cardiac issue, he passed away on Monday. He was 61. Leach was regarded as an innovative coach and a revolutionary. Minshew opted to memorialize him in that light.

How did Gardner Minshew perform at Washington State? Gardner Minshew had a unique journey to play under Leach, first at Troy before moving on to Northwest Mississippi Community College and then East Carolina. In 2018, he transferred as a graduate student to Washington State. After two underwhelming seasons in East Carolina, Minshew was the nation\'s top passer in Washington. The Jacksonville Jaguars selected him in the sixth round of the draft after he won the PAC-12 Offensive Player of the Year award.

', ""Which team would be the perfect fit for Cam Newton?  Cam Newton's stint with the New England Patriots came to a surprising end as the quarterback was released to reach the 53-man roster limit.  Newton was the Patriots' starting quarterback for the 2020 season and entered a battle with rookie Mac Jones for the job in the pre-season, which Jones definitely won today with the veteran's release. The 2015 NFL MVP made some good appearances in the pre-season, but New England decided to focus on the future and give Jones the most snaps he can take as a rookie.        It's also worth noting that even though Newton seems to be healthier than 2020, Jones gives the Patriots the best chance to win in 2021.           There wasn't just one reason that Cam Newton is gone. It was a combination of at least three, I'm told: Mac Jones' emergence, Newton's vaccination stance (which caused a bit of a stir behind the scenes) and Cam's uninspiring performance this summer.‚Äî Adam Beasley (@AdamHBeasley) August 31, 2021 However, a question arises with Newton's release: which team would be the best fit for the veteran in 2021? Washington Football Team the most logic spot for Newton With the regular season only nine days away, there aren't a lot of spots that make sense for Newton to be in. Washington is the outlier in that sense.     Connections with coach Ron Rivera, who drafted and coached Newton for the Carolina Panthers from 2011 to 2019, made it a possibility when the veteran first became a free agent in March 2020. A deal was never reached because Washington had Dwayne Haskins on the roster and they focused on developing the young quarterback, but things went south from there. The situation is different now, as Newton knows he'll have to settle for a backup role if he wants to play in 2021. Ryan Fitzpatrick, Washington's starter, has been kind of a journeyman during his career, and we can never discard the possibility of Fitzpatrick being benched. Super Bowl 50 - Carolina Panthers v Denver Broncos     If Newton joins Washington, he'll be on a team where the backup position is valuable and, if something happens to Fitzpatrick, whether he gets injured or is benched for a poor performance, Newton would play for a team that gives him an opportunity to compete for a playoff spot. A couple of factors in play with releasing Cam Newton rather than keeping him on as the Patriots' backup: His command of the locker room, and his vaccination status. Neither make him an ideal choice as a backup behind a rookie QB.‚Äî Doug Kyed (@DougKyed) August 31, 2021 Newton needs to settle for a backup role With the regular season only a few days away, Newton won't be the presumed starter for any team, even those with a murky quarterback situation.     This is not a position like offensive lineman or kickers, where it doesn't take much to learn the system and you can just go out and perform. Quarterbacks are the most important pieces on a team and it always takes some time to learn the playbook.That's why Washington is the best landing spot for Newton. He's already familiar with the coaching staff. He'll have a shot at playing during the season, considering who their starter is.But if the veteran thinks he'll be able to find a starting spot in the league, even after a decent pre-season, he's setting himself up for disappointment.     "", ""5 surprising cuts that happened during the NFL season  While news breaking about surprising cuts is a common occurrence in the NFL's preseason, it's fairly rare to see cuts announced in midseason ‚Äî like the news linebacker Jaylon Smith was presented with by the Dallas Cowboys this week.  The 26-year-old Pro Bowler was deemed surplus to requirements by owner Jerry Jones and head coach Mike McCarthy, which leads us to look at five of the NFL's most shocking midseason roster moves where a leading player was cut off.        5 of the most surprising cuts made by NFL teams during the season           #1 ‚Äì LeGarrette Blount, Pittsburgh Steelers, November 2014 Former Pittsburgh Steelers running back LeGarrette Blount LeGarrette Blount was already in hot water with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2014 after being handed a DUI when he was caught driving his Camaro with Le'Veon Bell and a 20 gram bag of marijuana. Things turned even more sour after Blount was benched in Week 11. He left the field while Steelers were in victory formation and was later cut. Blount's stay in Pittsburgh lasted less than a season.     #2 ‚Äì Ryan Mallet, Houston Texans, October 2015 Houston Texans quarterback Ryan Mallet After a series of embarrassing events, Ryan Mallet blew his chance to establish himself as the Houston Texans starting quarterback. After being acquired by trade from the New England Patriots, head coach Bill O'Brien installed Mallet as the starter for the 2014 season but the QB only played three games before a torn pectoral muscle ended his season. Brian Hoyer beat Mallet for the starter's jersey during the 2015 preseason, and a day after the announcement, Mallet missed practice after sleeping through his alarm in scenes amplified by NFL Films' hit show Hard Knocks. The comedy of errors didn't end there. Ahead of a Week 7 road game, Mallet missed the team flight and the Texans severed ties and cut the gaff-prone QB on October 27.     #3 ‚Äì Antonio Brown, Oakland Raiders, September 2019 Antonio Brown with Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr in the 2019 preseason Another awkward scenario that played out on Hard Knocks was the tale of Antonio Brown's frozen feet. After signing a big-money deal to be the marquee signing in Jon Gruden's first year at the Oakland Raiders, Brown froze his toes by not wearing the correct protection in a cryotherapy chamber. While training alone during camp, Brown kicked up a fuss about the league's new helmet rules and refused to embrace enhanced safety gear. After making a public apology for the distractions he caused, Brown demanded his release two days before the Raiders' Week 1 game. He signed for the New England Patriots and was cut by them after one game, following accusations of sexual assualt.

He was fined $5,000 for breaking COVID-19 protocols by bringing a friend into the team bubble, and was later stripped of the captaincy and fined $40,000 for being photographed at a party without a facemask. After being benched once again for poor performance, Washington Football Team head coach Ron Rivera felt Haskins had been handed enough chances and the quarterback was cut with one game remaining in the 2020 season. Albert Breer@AlbertBreerForgot to put this in the MMQB column, but I looked up the fastest first-round QBs to be outright cut since 2000.

"", ""5 takeaways from the Pittsburgh Steelers' win over the Philadelphia Eagles in preseason  In the first official week of the 2021 NFL preseason, the Philadelphia Eagles went up against the Pittsburgh Steelers, with the Steelers winning their second-straight NFL preseason game 24-16.   We got to see a lot more of OC Matt Canada's new offense in Pittsburgh, though. The Eagles had some success, but have a number of things to work on in training camp before they endure the rigors of the regular season.         Here are a some of the main takeaways from the Pittsburgh Steelers vs Philadelphia Eagles game in Week 1 of the NFL preseason.            Five things we learned from Pittsburgh Steelers vs Philadelphia Eagles  #1 - Preseason MVPs on each team Eagles WR Quez Watkins can flat out FLY üí® üí® üí® pic.twitter.com/8l26sk2Q4y‚Äî Field Yates (@FieldYates) August 13, 2021 Ben Roethlisberger once again sat out for the Pittsburgh Steelers, but Jalen Hurts got in some early reps. The Steelers also played a majority of their starters, outside of a select few.      For the Philadelphia Eagles, the clear MVP of the game was WR Quez Watkins. Right before kickoff, the announcers claimed they were keeping an eye on Watkins for his speed and they weren't wrong. Early in the game, Quez Watkins was able to burn past his defender as Jalen Hurts threw to him running up the sideline. Unfortunately, it was overthrown and out of reach.  Later in the first quarter, Watkins caught a screen pass from QB Joe Flacco and turned on the turbo for a 79-yard TD thanks to a few good blocks. His speed has gained him attention in training camp and it could land him in the starting rotation at this rate. McFarland fighting for the Touchdown! #Steelers pic.twitter.com/MhGobqSW9s‚Äî Blitzburgh ‚ú® (@BlitzVideos) August 13, 2021     For the Pittsburgh Steelers, the entire RB room was the MVP. Dwayne Haskins was a close second with his 161 yards and a TD, including several passes in tight windows. He had some rocky moments as well, though.  Overall, the Pittsburgh Steelers' RBs ran for 160 yards on 37 carries (4.3 yards per carry). Tony Brooks-James was the lead rusher with 51 yards and had several nice gains in the second half. Jaylen Samuels was able to make a case for a roster spot with 45 yards and newly-signed Pete Guerriero had 20 yards.  Najee Harris had a couple nice moments, but had one taken back by a holding call. #2 - Players who might be on the roster bubble  While there were many bright spots in this game, both teams could look at a few players and put them on the shortlist for the roster bubble when it comes time for the first cuts. Nick Mullens throws a pick with his first throw as an Eagle#Eagles #FlyEaglesFly pic.twitter.com/I9cw8H2ael‚Äî Brodes Media (@BrodesMedia) August 13, 2021     For Philadelphia, that player could be QB Nick Mullens. Mullens was primed to have a positive outing in this game and show that he can drive a team downfield with some success. Instead, he looked far from confident on the field. His first INT occurred when he was forced to get the ball out quickly with pressure closing in. He threw it behind his receiver and Justin Layne snagged it.  His second pick was more his own fault. Mullens showed a lack of arm strength and follow-through on a deep pass that was also a late throw. Lafayette Pitts was able to pick it from the air and get a decent return. The Pittsburgh Steelers might also have to take a second look at TE Zach Gentry. He had two targets in the game, but clearly dropped one. Dwayne Haskins' pass was a little behind him but still catchable.  Gentry only had one target in the Hall of Fame Game and Kevin Rader could end up jumping him on the depth chart. He's yet to make an impact as a 2019 fifth-round pick.     #3 - Dwayne Haskins is making strides at QB3, but Josh Dobbs is still in the reckoning for the Pittsburgh Steelers Vintage Dwayne Haskins üòç pic.twitter.com/7NPC1P4vrH‚Äî Barstool OSU (@BarstoolOSU) August 13, 2021 Pittsburgh Steelers QB Josh Dobbs only had 30 passing yards and an INT in this game but had a much better outing in the Hall of Fame Game. He played in the fourth quarter, where the Pittsburgh Steelers were constantly feeding their RBs, who were carving up the sleepy Philadelphia DL.  His first pass was low and his second was picked off after Elijah Riley read his eyes and jumped the route. Several of Dobbs' passes were low and almost out of reach for his targets.     Haskins played well in his role for the Pittsburgh Steelers, but it was far from perfect. He threaded the needle on several key throws, but had some that were off-target and wobbly. The biggest takeaway was the mental mistakes he made, such as running the wrong way on a read-option play.  Haskins will likely still start over Dobbs in the next game for the Pittsburgh Steelers, but Dobbs could get back in the game with a strong showing. #4 - Philadelphia DL was sluggish and ineffective for most of the second half The Eagles pulled most of their starters in the second half, but left some second-string players in. DC Jonathan Gannon should have made some personnel changes in the third quarter, as his defensive line was pounded on and slowed as the quarter went on.  The Pittsburgh Steelers possessed the ball for the majority of the third quarter, thanks to their success running the ball up the middle.

He seemed to have the punter battle in his pocket, but then Jordan Berry showed up.  His first punt was recovered at the two-yard line and his second bounced back, similar to Harvin's a week earlier, and was downed inside the 10. His longest of the night was 54 yards.

"", ""2021 NFL Draft: Ohio State football players ready to make an impact in the NFL  Since 2000 the Ohio State Buckeyes have produced the most college football players that were drafted by NFL teams. The Buckeyes have had 141 players drafted into the NFL, of which 84 players were drafted in the first-round of the NFL Draft, which is the most of all-time.  They are currently tied with Alabama for the most first-round picks since 2000 with 31 players. Ohio State had three players go within the first 20 picks in the 2020 NFL Draft. They have had the most defensive backs, defensive lineman and wide receivers drafted since 2000.        Its safe to say that the Ohio State Buckeyes have gifted NFL franchises with outstanding talent for the past 20 years.            Five Ohio State Buckeyes that will make immediate impact in the 2021 NFL Season 5) Chris Olave, Wide Receiver, Ohio State Chris Olave has been the top wide receiver at Ohio State for the past two seasons. When watching Olave at Ohio State, he showed great route running abilities as well as great hands, while catching almost every ball thrown his way. CBS Sports has Chris Olave ranked number 11 when it comes to wide receiver prospects. With the NFL Combine being in jeopardy, it is unknown if Chris Olave will be able to improve his ranking before the 2021 NFL Draft. Olave will likely hear his name called on day two of this year's draft. ESPN‚Äôs Todd McShay believes #OhioState‚Äôs Chris Olave can be a first-round pick (FREE)https://t.co/C9dv3pQxXX pic.twitter.com/O9fXWYBneO‚Äî Bucknuts (@Bucknuts247) January 14, 2021     Being selected on the second day of the 2021 NFL Draft is a blessing for Olave. He will most likely be drafted by a playoff-contending team and will be able to show off his skill set. His explosiveness and deep threat abilities are amongst the best in the 2021 group of wide receivers.  4) Trey Sermon, Running Back, Ohio State Trey Sermon took some time to bust onto the scene at Ohio State. He notably had a huge Big Ten Championship game, in which he broke the Ohio State single game rushing record. He then carried the form from that game over to the College Football Playoffs in the semi-final against Clemson. üî•üå∞ @treyera has been ridiculous in the last two games for @OhioStateFB! #FOXFacts pic.twitter.com/zIyJjQ3RtY‚Äî FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) January 2, 2021     Trey Sermon was the difference-maker in the College Football Playoff semi-final game. Unfortunately for Sermon, he was injured on his first run of the National Championship game against Alabama. Sermon is the eighth best running back in the 2021 NFL Draft. Trey Sermon will thrive in an offense that utilizes their running backs in both the running and passing game. One team that stands out is the Buffalo Bills, and he would give them a huge upgrade at the running back position. Buffalo could get Trey Sermon in the third or fourth round of the 2021 NFL Draft.  3) Shaun Wade, Defensive Back, Ohio State Shaun Wade made an early decision to opt-out of the 2020 College Football Season because it was supposed to be canceled. Once the Big Ten changed their decision, Wade opted back in. However, his performance in the National Championship game could have hurt his draft stock. He has all the right intangibles to be a great NFL corner. Wade can play the perimeter of the field with the best of them and will most likely hear his name called on day one of the 2021 NFL Draft. He will be one of the Ohio State Buckeyes selected in the top 25 picks.     Shaun Wade would be a great fit for the Jacksonville Jaguars, playing under his old coach Urban Meyer. He would also be a good fit for the Cleveland Browns playing alongside former Ohio State corner Denzel Ward. Wade has the skill set to be an instant contributor to any NFL defense.  2) Wyatt Davis, Interior Offensive Lineman, Ohio State Wyatt Davis is the second-highest ranked Ohio State player from their 2020 team. CBS Sports has Davis just behind Penei Sewell from Oregon. Davis has been the glue that has kept the Buckeyes offensive line together. üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è@wyattdavis53 is a unanimous first-team All-Americanüò§üò§üò§#GoBuckeyes pic.twitter.com/EqNStSOSkz‚Äî Ohio State Football (@OhioStateFB) January 9, 2021     Davis has all the abilities that NFL Scouts are looking for in an interior offensive lineman. He showed that he can run and pass block with the best of them while starting at Ohio State. Davis could hear his name being called early in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft. There are a few NFL teams that would benefit from Drafting Wyatt Davis. Los Angeles Chargers are one of the teams that could use him up front. The other team would be the Dallas Cowboys. No matter where Wyatt Davis goes he will be a day one starter for any NFL franchise.  1) Justin Fields, Quarterback, Ohio State There is a big storm cloud that hovers over Justin Fields. That cloud is the former Ohio State quarterbacks who have failed miserably in the NFL, the most recent being Dwayne Haskins Jr. Justin Fields will forgo his senior season and enter the 2021 NFL draft, he announced on Twitter.He finished his college career with 5,701 pass yards, 67 TD, 9 INTs, 1,133 rush yards and 19 TD. pic.twitter.com/YGZ9DiHV0w‚Äî SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) January 18, 2021     Justin Fields is projected to be selected in the top five of the 2021 NFL Draft. Fields has been the backbone of the success Ohio State has had over the past two years and has been the Buckeyes' leader since transferring from Georgia.Fields has all the skills that come with being an NFL franchise quarterback. His ability to throw on the run is remarkable and he possesses great arm strength and tremendous football IQ.Justin Fields will look to rewrite the failures of former Ohio State quarterbacks by leading an NFL franchise after being drafted.     "", 'NFL QB battles: Predicting winners of top 5 neck-and-neck battles  Over the last few days, two NFL teams have named their starters for the 2021 NFL season.   The Jacksonville Jaguars officially, and unsurprisingly, named rookie Trevor Lawrence as their starter for the upcoming campaign. In Denver, Teddy Bridgewater won the quarterback battle and Drew Lock will serve as the backup.         However, there are still three NFL teams that don\'t have an official QB1 for the 2021 season and five others are still figuring out their QB2.           Below, we project the winners of a few quarterback battles. Projected winners for top QB battles in the NFL  #1 New England Patriots - Mac Jones, QB1 Mac Jones on a frozen rope üöÄ pic.twitter.com/rOiDECIg0t‚Äî PFF (@PFF) August 20, 2021 This is probably the most straightforward prediction after recent events.  A miscommunication led to Cam Newton violating the NFL\'s health and safety protocol and the veteran will now miss most of this week\'s practices ahead of the preseason finale.      Rookie Mac Jones will take this opportunity to solidify his case for the starting job further and win it with a good outing in the Patriots\' NFL preseason finale against the New York Giants.  #2 New Orleans Saints - Jameis Winston, QB1 SLING DAT THING @Jaboowins! üí™29-yard TD strike to @CallawayMarquez üôåüì∫: ESPN pic.twitter.com/SPBZczDB1b‚Äî New Orleans Saints (@Saints) August 24, 2021 The battle between Jameis Winston and Taysom Hill has gone on longer than expected, but the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback is finally starting to pull ahead.  Winston is playing with confidence and has been efficient while leading the offense during the preseason. The former number one overall pick already had the advantage due to his history of putting up big passing numbers.      With Winston as the starter, Taysom Hill can still carve out a specialty role to get game time.  #3 San Francisco 49ers - Jimmy Garoppolo, QB1 Jimmy Garoppolo has ‚Äúa pretty good idea‚Äù of who‚Äôs starting for the #49ers Week 1. This is the unbothered answer of a man who spends zero time on Twitter. pic.twitter.com/2KT366w4L5‚Äî Lydia (@limajuliettango) August 25, 2021 Trey Lance might be the better NFL quarterback prospect, but the San Francisco 49ers have over $20 million invested in Jimmy Garoppolo this year and he\'s more experienced.  That\'s not to say the 49ers can\'t make a change later in the season if they are eliminated from playoff contention, or Garoppolo struggles or gets injured. The best-case scenario is to put Lance in before the NFL trade deadline if he\'s still the better player and trade Garoppolo to a needy team.     #4 Pittsburgh Steelers - Mason Rudolph, QB2  A very underrated play of the night here from Mason Rudolph. Free rusher in his face, avoids the sack and has great awareness to try and fight to move the chains. Take your hat off and hand it to 2 here, with some help from Finney and Green. I loved this. #Steelers pic.twitter.com/3QsOiUGJ3z‚Äî Josh Carney (@ByJoshCarney) August 22, 2021 Dwayne Haskins was announced as the Steelers\' NFL preseason finale starter, meaning Mason Rudolph will be the backup to Ben Roethlisberger this year.  Haskins still has to beat Joshua Dobbs for a roster spot, which should be easy if he plays well against the Carolina Panthers\' starting defense. This year, Haskins had a solid shot at winning QB2, but Rudolph\'s strong NFL preseason performances seem to have won him the battle.     #5 Dallas Cowboys - Cooper Rush, QB2 Head coach Mike McCarthy confirmed it will be Cooper Rush taking the first-team reps at quarterback during today\'s press conference.üó£Ô∏è ""He has earned this opportunity, absolutely."" üó£Ô∏è‚Äî Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) August 23, 2021 In a surprising turn of events, Cooper Rush quietly climbed the depth chart during the NFL preseason and is in line to be the Dallas Cowboys\' backup quarterback for the 2021 season.  Garrett Gilbert entered camp as Dak Prescott\'s backup but had a disastrous outing against the Houston Texans. Rush went 25-of-38 for 256 yards and two touchdowns in preseason action. Between Rush and Gilbert, the former looked like the better NFL quarterback under pressure and proved he can lead the offense down the field. Rush was the Cowboys\' backup quarterback from 2017-2019 before Andy Dalton took over in 2020 but earned his spot back.     ']"
13,Trevor Lawrence,"[""Weather for Jets game tonight: Jaguars face challenging conditions ahead of Week 16 TNF showdown  The Jacksonville Jaguars will travel to MetLife Stadium to face the New York Jets on Thursday Night Football. The Jaguars may have gotten on the plane to temperatures in the high 60's, but it will be a much different story when they land in the northeast.  As winter weather brought by Storm Elliot sweeps across the United States, there are sure to be some disruptions this weekend in some important NFL games. The first being tonight's game where the temperature at kickoff is set to be in the 40's, which wouldn't be bad if that were the only weather issue. There is also an 80% chance of rain and heavy winds are also expected throughout the game.                      The Jaguars have already played in one game this season that was affected by weather, in Week 4 against the Philadelphia Eagles. The main issue for Jacksonville in that game was ball security as it is for most teams when the conditions are wet and windy. Fantasy Football Weather Guys@FFWeatherGuysWinter Storm #Elliot will start to impact the Northeast tonight, driving heavy rain and wind for tonight's #TNFonPrime event where the New York Jets host the Jacksonville Jaguars91     Jaguars offensive coordinator Press Taylor told reporters on Tuesday that they are aware of the weather outlook. He said that he knows what changes they need to make to improve on their performance earlier in the year: ‚ÄúWe understand that we kind of had our own self-inflicted issues in Philly in terms of our ball security. That‚Äôs just something we‚Äôve been aware of, we‚Äôve tried to emphasize that. Every single week we‚Äôve gone in, we‚Äôve played games where there‚Äôs expected rain. Whether that was home games or on the road. That‚Äôs certainly something we‚Äôre aware of, we understand that we have to do a better job than we did.‚Äù         Quarterback Trevor Lawrence is even pondering the idea of wearing gloves during Thursday night's game to help him grip the ball. He fumbled four times and threw one interception the last time he played in the rain. Lawrence has had a solid past few weeks, including an overtime win over the Dallas Cowboys in Week 15. Whether he will switch up the game plan will likely be a gametime decision. IS QB Zach Wilson playing in Week 16 against the Jaguars? The Jacksonville Jaguars are still alive in the AFC South race and after a win against the Dallas Cowboys last week, anything can happen for this young team. Their next obstacles will be the New York Jets and the poor weather conditions. WFAN Sports Radio@WFAN660It will officially be Zach Wilson starting for the Jets again on Thursday:bit.ly/3hM7Ejn71     So, who will be the starting quarterback for the New York Jets? That would be Zach Wilson. Although Wilson was benched by head coach Robert Saleh to give him time to work on his mechanics, he returned to the starting position last week. This was due to Mike White sustaining serious rib injuries in Week 14.Saleh is putting his confidence in Wilson again this week as the Jets try to stay in the AFC playoff bubble. A loss to Jacksonville will likely take them out of contention.     "", ""Will Trevor Lawrence be the most productive rookie QB of 2021?  When Roger Goodell read Trevor Lawrence's name as the first overall pick in the NFL Draft, it was the most predictable first pick in years. Now, months on from that moment, the NFL is speeding toward the beginning of Lawrence's first season.  How will the young rookie do? Will he be the most productive rookie quarterback of 2021?        Trevor Lawrence's history in a new system           Looking back at his college stats, it seems that Lawrence is not afraid to come out in a career firing on all cylinders. In his freshman season at Clemson, he played 15 games. In those games, he completed 65.2 percent of his passes and threw for 3280 yards, 30 touchdowns and four interceptions.

If any rookie quarterback is prepared to adapt to the Jacksonville Jaguars and the NFL as a whole, it is Trevor Lawrence. Trevor Lawrence in the NFL Of course, it is not entirely up to Trevor Lawrence if he succeeds. Plenty of hyped-up quarterbacks land with a bottom-tier franchise and slowly wash out of the league.     Unfortunately for Lawrence, he has a lot working against him. He is playing for a rookie head coach in Urban Meyer. Urban Meyer has had plenty of success in college, but the NFL is a different game. NFL coaches have less control over their players than college coaches. NFL coaches have to be much more tactful when talking to the players whereas college coaches' word is law. If Urban Meyer's transition is anything less than smooth, the whole operation will become impaired. Impaired teams fall apart during the season. Currently, there are a lot of distractions on the team as well. The team signed Tim Tebow as a tight end and still has Gardner Minshew on the roster. These are two powder kegs that could create a lot of problems for the Jaguars. Tim Tebow's clout could clog up the locker room as the low-stringed player gets more attention than the starting tight end.     At the same time, Gardner Minshew is one of the most distracting players in the NFL with his haircuts and personality. Urban Meyer needs to address these problems before the team can achieve the level of focus required to be a force in the NFL.     Lastly, Jacksonville's roster is a mess and facing a high-rate of turnovers. The Jaguars currently have the fourth youngest roster in the NFL, according to nfltraderumors. This is because the team has not had many draft picks turn out to be good enough to keep around for long. This has resulted in a roster that is lacking talent in too many positions.     It seems that the team will not have too many weapons for Trevor Lawrence to throw to. If this is the case, it will limit his ability to be productive in the NFL. Urban Meyer Trevor Lawrence needs a lot to go his way in the next several months in order to put together a strong rookie season that could compete to be the best rookie season of the year. He needs Urban Meyer to work out well and he needs the distractions to cease. He also needs the roster to play like a veteran squad. Entering a season with that many questions usually leads to a rough rookie outing.If Trevor Lawrence has a good rookie season, it will be because of him and him alone.     "", ""Most interceptions in a playoff game: Where does Trevor Lawrence's disaster debut land?  Trevor Lawrence endured a nightmare outing in his first playoff game for the Jacksonville Jaguars against the Los Angeles Chargers. He threw four interceptions and no touchdowns.  Going into the two-minute warning in the first half, he could not even lead the team down to field goal range. Thankfully, he threw for one touchdown to end the half, to ensure that the Jaguars did not remain scoreless.        It was as bad as it got in the first half and based on that alone, he moved into the leaderboard for most interceptions in a playoff game. Brett Favre is top of the list with six. Trevor Lawrence already had four in the first half.           It comes as a contrast to Brock Purdy's involvement in four touchdowns for the San Francisco 49ers against the Seattle Seahawks earlier in the day. This really was not a good look for Lawrence. Purdy was the last selection in this year's draft and Trevor Lawrence was the consensus first pick in 2021 Yet, their performances did not show that today. Jono Barnes@JonoBarnesBrock Purdy, an ill-considered 262th pick, having the game he had tonight and Trevor Lawrence, a hyped up 1st overall pick, having the game he‚Äôs having tonight is honestly why the NFL is the greatest sports league.719     NFL QBs ahead of Trevor Lawrence with most interceptions in a playoff game ft. Brett Favre The most interceptions in a playoff game are six. Only one of them came during the Super Bowl era. Brett Favre threw six interceptions in the 2001 season when the Green Bay Packers played the St. Louis Rams. He threw for six interceptions and just two touchdowns. The earliest instance of six interceptions in a playoff game came during the NFL Championship game in 1946. Frank Filchock of the New York Giants was the guilty party. Like Favre many years later, he also threw for two touchdowns against the Chicago Bears. The 1950s saw two consecutive NFL Championship games, where the quarterback threw six interceptions. In 1954, Detroit Lions quarterback Bobby Layne threw six picks and no touchdowns. The following year, in 1955, Los Angeles Rams quarterback Norm van Brocklin threw one touchdown but six interceptions. Both those games were against the Cleveland Browns. 14 quarterbacks have also thrown five interceptions in playoff games.     Michael David Smith@MichaelDavSmithThe NFL record for interceptions thrown in a playoff game is 6. Trevor Lawrence is halfway to tying it, and it's still the first quarter.(The QBs who have thrown 6 interceptions in a playoff game are Brett Favre, Frank Filchock, Bobby Layne and Norm Van Brocklin.)2311The good news for Trevor Lawrence is that he recovered to start the second half by throwing for two touchdowns in the third quarter.

Many analysts compared him to Peyton Manning, Andrew Luck, and John Elway and felt he\'s the kind of talent that could completely change the trajectory of a failing team.        However, his first season was a bust, primarily due to the lack of talent surrounding him in Jacksonville.           The 2020 ACC Player of the Year could have refused to play for the Jacksonville Jaguars. Perhaps another quarterback-needy team would have traded picks or even players for him. He could have also found himself with the Detroit Lions or New York Jets. In a recent article for Pro Football Talk, Mike Florio brought up the topic of how the draft should be approached by top prospects. Florio said that while it‚Äôs too late for Lawrence to change the past, players like Arch Manning, who are expected to be drafted early, should be aware of what they are signing up for.

The Colts eventually traded him away to the Denver Broncos. The only other instance of this happening was when Eli Manning said he would not play for the Chargers after being drafted and was traded to the New York Giants.     Also Checkout:- Trevor Lawrence Net Worth Trevor Lawrence is the type of talent that can turn a bad team\'s fortunes around The Jaguars often find themselves in the top five of the draft, but a talent like Lawrence should be able to change that.

He guided the Jaguars to a win that eliminated their division rivals from the playoffs.With Super Bowl-winning head coach Doug Pederson now leading the team, the Jaguars are poised to surprise a lot of naysayers this season. Look for Lawrence to settle into his role and lift the team to new heights.     ', 'Are Philadelphia Eagles still unsure about QB Jalen Hurts? Philadelphia trades for Jacksonville QB Gardner Minshew  The Philadelphia Eagles may have made a very underrated roster move by acquiring QB Garnder Minshew from the Jacksonville Jaguars, adding to a roster with Jalen Hurts and Joe Flacco already in place. Gardner Minshew lost a QB ""battle"" that he was never seriously going to win against the number one overall pick Trevor Lawrence. Minshew was a breakout star in 2019 when he took over for Nick Foles. In 2020, he struggled on the field with a lingering hand injury that impacted his performance. The Jaguars drafted Lawrence, a generational talent, and it was just a matter of time before they traded Gardner Minshew as he wasn\'t going to unseat Trevor Lawrence any time soon.  Trade: #Eagles have acquired QB Gardner Minshew from Jacksonville in exchange for a conditional sixth-round pick in 2022. The team also released QB Nick Mullens. pic.twitter.com/MLYrJfymxE‚Äî Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) August 28, 2021        Gardner Minshew trade shows uncertainty with Jalen Hurts...and Jacksonville Jaguars head coach?           Enter the Philadelphia Eagles, who have been in deep thought on what Jalen Hurts\' future holds with the team. Through three NFL preseason games, Jalen Hurts saw action only in Week 1 as the starter (3/7 for 54 yards). QB Joe Flacco played most of the preseason and played well, too. Philadelphia seems to be hinting to Jalen Hurts that his time as a starter could be in jeopardy by offering a sixth-round pick for Gardner Minshew. So yes, the Philadelphia Eagles are still not sold on Jalen Hurts being the face of their franchise. That doesn\'t mean he\'ll be benched immediately for Flacco or Minshew, who is #3 on the depth chart. The team does have options at QB now though, if injury, COVID-19, or regression strikes Jalen Hurts. Flacco had a great preseason and showed he can still perform with success in the NFL, but he\'s not suited to lead Nick Sirianni\'s offense. It requires a smaller, more mobile and athletic player and that has never been Joe Flacco. Gardner Minshew, on the other hand, looks like a prime candidate for such a system. The Eagles do not know if he\'ll be more like the 2019 or 2020 Gardner Minshew, though. It would be smart not to give Minshew responsibilities on the offense before he earns them.     Eagles just landed a 25-year old QB that has completed 62.9% with 37 TD, only 11 INT, and 93.1% rating in his first two seasons for a stinking 6th round pick. Gardner Minshew is a winning NFL quarterback. Absolute no-brainer deal for Howie Roseman.‚Äî Jim Nagy (@JimNagy_SB) August 28, 2021 Jacksonville dropped the ball with Gardner Minshew Giving up a sixth-round pick for a QB with 5,530 passing yards and 37 passing TDs in two years is a steal and says more about the dysfunction and uncertainty in Jacksonville than Philadelphia. The so-called QB competition seemed like an act to boost Minshew\'s trade value, which failed obviously and leaves HC Urban Meyer to be criticized for such a move. Still, Philadelphia does well to have extra options at QB, something they\'ve been known to do over the years.     Despite playing 13 less full games, Jalen Hurts had more 300+ passing yard performances than Baker Mayfield.In Hurts‚Äô 3 game stretch of full starts, he also averaged more YPG, TD per game, and had a higher Comp %.#Eagles pic.twitter.com/mpF8OkEpb4‚Äî Eagles Nation (@PHLEaglesNation) August 23, 2021 Jalen Hurts has potential, but needs to utilize it early in 2021 Jalen Hurts is still just 23 with only four career starts, even though it may feel he\'s played more than that. A 1-3 record isn\'t great and neither is a 52% completion rate, 6 TDs, and four INTs. The upside is that he\'s shown he can lead, the offense respects him, and he\'s had 300+ yards in two of his four starts. He\'s played much better in training camp, but he really needed the reps in the preseason regardless of the Eagles wanting to rest him to prevent an injury. Jalen Hurts\' small amount of playing time in his career isn\'t large enough to really allow him to have a long leash as a starter and he will be under the microscope. While Gardner Minshew\'s arrival isn\'t a formal answer to Jalen Hurts losing his starting job, it does prove the Eagles feel they need to have suitable options on the depth chart. Don\'t bet on Philadelphia having a winning season in 2021.     ']"

How the personal trainer had Tom Brady\'s back in the quest for longevity  Every athlete has some sort of support system in their corner, even the GOATs like Tampa Bay Buccaneers QB Tom Brady. Everyone is aware of Tom Brady\'s health regiments and strict diet through his historic run with the New England Patriots, but it wasn\'t his own dietary plan. The man behind Tom Brady\'s longevity is alternative medicine practitioner-turned-personal trainer Alex Guerrero.  Alex Guerrero, Tom Brady, and TB12        Tom Brady has worked with Alex Guerrero on getting into an 80/20 alkaline diet (80% alkalic and 20% acidic) that is mostly vegan and strays from inflammation foods such as tomatoes, peppers, mushrooms, and eggplants. The two men have become business partners in the TB12 brand, including a peak performance website TB12sports.com, TB12 Sports Therapy Center next to Gillette Stadium, a health program based on Tom Brady\'s book The TB12 Method, the TB12 Nutrition Manual (branded snacks, protein bars, prepared meals and smoothies), and TB12 workout gear that includes ""recovery pajamas"" that help recover from physcial exertion and trauma.           Alex Guerrero has been the right hand man for Tom Brady\'s health for years and monitors everything he puts into his body. However, he\'s been apart of several different legal and financial battles. In 2005, the FTC sanctioned him for falsely promoting himself as a legit doctor claiming to cure cancers, AIDs, and other diseases with a dietary supplement through infomercials. Guerrero helped establish 6 Degree Nutrition, a company that produces nutritional supplements like Neurosafe, and stated it protects users from the ""consequences of sports-related traumatic brain injuries"" by producing nutrients to the brain. WR Wes Welker and Tom Brady both advocated for the product before the FTC settled with Alex Guerrero and shut down the company in 2012, ceasing any further productions.     The Boston Globe reported that Alex Guerrero has a history of ""financial issues and legal entanglements."" He has since rejuventated his career by tying it to Tom Brady\'s career. When Brady played for the New England Patriots, Alex Guerrero worked with many other players on the team: Danny Amendola, Julian Edelman, Jimmy Garoppolo, Rob Gronkowski, and Ty Law. In 2017, Alex Guerrero caused friction with the Patriots\' management and training staff. He was overly involved and intervened by having too many team privileges as a non-NFL employee. His privileges were heavily banned and wasn\'t allowed into certain parts of the building. Through his many legal issues, slanders, and lawsuits, Tom Brady still trusted Alex Guerrero with his career and health.

He claims to have known of Brady playing in 2020 with a torn MCL but the Buccaneers knew little or nothing about it. Guerrero also helps Tom Brady\'s emotional levels with his diet, including the ""emotional foods"" of pizza and burgers after an injury to cope with the stress. You can say what you want about Alex Guerrero\'s integrity or past, but he has been able to help Tom Brady keep in shape and remain a top-ten QB in the NFL into his 40s.Alex Guerrero, @TomBrady\'s trainer, said he expects him to play at least two more years.

October 18, 2009, however, would quickly become a day to remember for the GOAT and a nightmare-fueled memory for Tennessee Titans fans. The New England Patriots would record a 59-0 win over the Titans, the NFL\'s biggest blowout ever.  NFL@NFL5 TDs in one half.6 TDs in total.All through a snow storm.This @TomBrady performance was legendary.  (via @NFLLegacy)4016468        It was an ok start for the Titans as the Patriots scored 10 points. Perhaps, the Titans had a chance. That would quickly end as Tom Brady threw two touchdown passes to wide receiver Randy Moss within a minute. Titans quarterback Vince Young threw an interception shortly afterward which, of course, resulted in yet another Patriots touchdown.           Tom Brady threw touchdown passes within the two-minute warning to wide receiver Wes Welker to make it 45-0 at halftime. Brady would surprisingly still play in the third quarter as he threw his final touchdown pass of the day to Moss. Backup quarterback Brian Hoyer would finally sub in for Brady and grab the final touchdown of the day as NFL history was made at the expense of the Tennesse Titans. Tom Brady would finish 29/34, 380 yards, and six touchdown passes, somehow not enough for a perfect passer rating. Welker would finish with 150 yards and two touchdowns, while Moss would have to settle for 129 yards and three TDs.

Tom Brady owns every quarterback stat ever Super Bowl LV No team in NFL history has ever won seven Super Bowls; however, a player has, and that man is Tom Brady. Brady would win six rings alongside Belichick, and the quarterback would prove he did not need Belichick when he brought a Super Bowl win home to Tampa. He has five Super Bowl MVPs and three regular-season MVPs.     Brady has the most passing yards (89,214) and the most touchdown passes ever (649), His records are secure for years to come. Patrick Mahomes is having an amazing NFL career so far, but he would probably have to play into his mid-40s to trouble Brady\'s records.Tom Brady is the NFL\'s undisputed GOAT.     ', ""What Does Tom Brady Eat? Here‚Äôs a Look at his TB12 Diet  The Tom Brady Diet, also called the TB12 Method, is a diet plan NFL legend Tom Brady came up with. It's based on eating whole foods and is one of the main reasons why the 45-year-old is still playing professional football.  The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback says that his diet and workout routine have helped him reduce risk of injury and improve his athletic performance, recovery, energy level, and health.        The first edition of the TB12 Method, which advises people how to eat like Tom Brady, came out in 2017. In 2020, a new version of the TB12 Method with updated information came out.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Some people have been able to lose weight by following the diet. Others do it in the hope that it would make them feel more energized and help them do better in sports. Many online reviews from people who have tried the diet have been positive, but critics say it's too complicated, can't be done long term and isn't based on science.     In this article, we will talk about the good and bad things about the Tom Brady Diet so that you can decide if it might work for you.  How to Follow the TB12 Diet? The Tom Brady Diet is a plant-based diet that focuses on whole foods that have been processed as little as possible. Whenever feasible, people are encouraged to eat only organic, locally grown, and seasonal foods. The diet also requires you to eat only organic, grass-fed, free-range, hormone-free and antibiotic-free meats and poultry, as well as wild, hormone-free, and antibiotic-free fish.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     People who follow this diet are told to eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes grown organically 80% of the time. Twenty per cent of the diet is made up of grass-fed, organic, antibiotic- and hormone-free lean meats and fish or seafood caught in the wild. The TB12 Method has a long list of foods to avoid or eat less of, as they can exacerbate inflammation. These foods are: Non-organic dairy from grass-fed cows, refined carbs, trans fats, and saturated fatsadded sugarssalt\\alcohol\\caffeine The diet also doesn't allow: GMOsMost cooking oils, such as canola and soyHigh fructose corn syrup, andOther foods that contain soy. Brady's personal chef is often quoted as saying that Brady stays away from nightshade vegetables, as they're thought to cause inflammation.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     However, research shows that nightshade vegetables do not cause inflammation. In fact, there's new evidence that suggests the opposite. The most recent version of the TB12 Method lets you eat nightshade vegetables, and the shopping list even includes tomatoes and peppers. The change is likely to be a good thing for people who'tr thinking about going on the diet. Besides the strict rules about what to eat, the TB12 Diet has a few other rules: Drink a lot of fluids. The TB12 Method requires you to drink half your bodyweight in water every day. Most of the water you drink should also have electrolytes added to it, but the diet says that you shouldn't drink water with or around meals.Meal timing: People who follow the diet are told not to eat within three hours of going to bed.Portion sizes: The diet says to eat meat, poultry, and fish in portions the size of your palm, along with two palms' worth of vegetables.When to stop eating: The TB12 Method requires you to stop eating when you're 75% full to supposedly help with digestion and nutrient absorption.

It might help you lose weight, keep you from getting sick, and improve your sports performance and recovery.Nevertheless, it's too restrictive and has some rules that don't make sense from a scientific point of view. Also, the many rules and restrictions make it probably tough to keep up for a long time.

', ""Tom Brady left in awe of Kelsey Plum after Las Vegas Aces star's record-breaking 40-point performance  It takes a lot to get the attention of former NFL quarterback and surefire Hall of Famer Tom Brady, but Las Vegas Aces basketball star Kelsey Plum has done just that.  With the WNBA season in full swing, the Aces (17-2) are rolling, including a 113-89 win over the Minnesota Lynx. The 24-point win was never in doubt as the Aces added to their advantage after each quarter.        But the biggest thing to come out of the game was Plum's incredible performance, as she dropped 40 points in just 31 minutes. She also had two rebounds and four assists, and Brady took notice of her efforts, sharing her game on his Instagram story.           Brady loves Plum's performance. In addition to her amazing performance, Plum also became the first player in franchise history to post a 40-point game. Per Sports Illustrated, Plum's previous high for points in a game was 26. Well, she smashed that against the Lynx.     In her 40-point effort, she also posted six 3-point shots while shooting 14-for-18. Putting it simply, Plum was unstoppable, and Tom Brady loved it.  Tom Brady's ownership stake in the Las Vegas Aces one of many off-field deals Brady, right, at the Connecticut Sky vs. Las Vegas Aces game. While Plum's efforts were superb, we think that Brady loved it twice as much, seeing as he has an ownership stake in the Aces. It is just one of Tom Brady's many off-field moves, and this one is, for some, one of his best yet.        Brady has other irons in the fire, of course, with his BradyBrand clothing line, his NFT business called Autograph and his TB12 Method still doing well.        While his on-field efforts are out of this world, Brady's off-field ones are just as good, and he is starting his 10-year contract with Fox Sports in 2024 as he makes a move to the broadcast booth.All in all, Tom Brady isn't slacking off since he retired, and he is clearly loving his life right now, even more so after Plum's 40-point effort.

The game started brightly for Dallas as they drove down the field and scored what would be their only points of the game. After that, it was tough sledding for Dallas as their receivers simply could not get open. Prescott often forced the ball into tight coverage and was lucky not to be picked off more than once. The Buccaneers held Dallas to 3/15 on third down as the offense could not move the ball at all and kept the home side to 2/5 on fourth down.

TB12 led the New England Patriots nine times to the Super Bowl, and he won six of them. He could have won seven Super Bowl titles when he was with the Pats; however, he failed to do so.        Super Bowl LII took place in February 2018 between the Patriots and the Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Even though Brady had a remarkable game, throwing for 505 yards and three touchdowns, his efforts were not enough to secure a victory for the Patriots.           In the second half, Tom Brady and his team faced a 10-point deficit. However, Brady led a comeback effort by throwing touchdown passes to Rob Gronkowski and Chris Hogan. The first touchdown pass helped narrow the gap, while the second one gave the Patriots a 33-32 lead with 9:22 remaining in the game. Despite Brady‚Äôs efforts to lead the Patriots to a victory, Nick Foles and the Eagles responded with a touchdown drive of their own. With the game on the line, Brady had the opportunity to engineer another iconic Super Bowl-winning drive. However, the Eagles‚Äô defense had other plans. Brandon Graham‚Äôs strip-sack of Brady halted New England‚Äôs comeback attempt.     ""They\'re all pretty disappointing,"" Brady said, per Edward Lewis of NFL.com. ""I mean, losing sucks. But you show up and you try to win and sometimes you lose and that\'s the way it goes. ... It obviously‚Äîyup, it sucks."" The strip-sack forced the turnover and gave possession back to Philadelphia.

Tom Brady\'s last Super Bowl loss came against the Eagles Super Bowl LII - Philadelphia Eagles v New England Patriots     The 15-time Pro Bowler retired from the NFL in February 2023, after his 2022 season went lukewarm. He played with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2020 to 2022 and won his last Super Bowl ring with them. But his last Super Bowl loss came against Nick Foles and the Eagles. Many argue that Tom Brady\'s performance against Philadelphia was the best of his entire career, although it brought no success. His ability to rally his team and make crucial plays was instrumental in putting the Patriots in a position to potentially win the game.Although Tom Brady\'s comeback bid fell short, his legacy as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history remained intact. The game showcased the competitiveness and drama that often defines Super Bowl matchups.

He has smashed tablets and sweared at his offensive line follow their loss. Now, while it is the height of lunacy to ever count out the G.O.A.T. in anything football-related, Pat McAfee went there by pointing out the issues the quarterback has been facing this season since his \'unretirement.\'        Pat McAfee@PatMcAfeeShowHow are we feeling about Tom Brady\'s unretirement @RapSheet...#PMSOverreactionMonday21013           The conversation began with Ian Rapoport being questioned about Brady\'s health. The NFL Insider confirmed that there is nothing physically wrong with the quarterback, except a sore throwing shoulder that he needs to keep loose during games. But beyond that, he emphasized his belief that Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers offense will be back because of the talent there. This caused Pat McAfee to weigh in and say, ""I don\'t believe Tom Brady is, you know, the same Tom Brady was a year ago or two years ago. Yeah. Did he make the worst now? Like I said, I\'m not allowed to say it was the worst unretirement in the history of unretirement of all sports. It sounds like it seems like from outside looking in.""     He brought up the problems off the field that Brady is facing and speculated that it is affecting his performance on the field as well. He continued, ""We don\'t know Tom. I do not know Tom. Outside looking in, hate that his entire personal life is being aired and grieved... It is seeming to affect what is going on the field...  ""Everything seems to have gone to sh*t since him unretiring, and that\'s like a real conversation that\'s going to have to take place because he is the greatest of all time. He is Tom Brady. He could be doing everything else."" What are Tom Brady\'s problems that Pat McAfee is referring to? Perhaps the biggest distraction this season for Brady has been his alleged decline in marital bliss with wife Gisele Bundchen. Reports suggest that she is unhappy with the quarterback\'s return to the NFL after retiring last year, especially as she believes she has put her successful modeling and advocacy career on hold to care for the family while he was playing.       Additionally, while he led the league last year in passing yards and touchdowns, this season he has dropped to 12th with just eight touchdowns after six games. It is an alarming drop and whether he can turn it around or not is something only Tom Brady can answer.

Although the Saints' offense was also limited by an offense quarterbacked by Taysom Hill and without head coach Sean Payton, out because of testing positive for COVID, their defense did what it typically does against Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which baffles them beyond epic proportions.

Tom Brady was held in check against the Saints in a performance not replicated in 15 years New Orleans Saints v Tampa Bay Buccaneers     On Sunday Night Football, the New Orleans Saints did the unthinkable: limit Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers offense to zero points for the entire game. This feat has not been done to Tom Brady in 15 years, since the Miami Dolphins shut out Brady's New England Patriots by a score of 21-0. As an aside, the head coach of those 2006 Miami Dolphins was none other than Nick Saban, the current head coach and conductor of the University of Alabama's college football dynasty. Saban is also a disciple of Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, so perhaps it's not that much of a surprise that it was that team that last shut out Brady. The record for a quarterback not being shut out in an NFL game currently sits at 255 games and is held by former New Orleans Saints quarterback and current NBC Sunday Night Football analyst Drew Brees. Ironically, it was Brees's former team that did a number on Brady and the Buccaneers' offense. The front four constantly sent pressure and collapsed the pocket around Brady, which is universally known as kryptonite for the seven-time Super Bowl champion.     And not to take away from a great defensive game from the Saints' defense, but during the course of the game, the Buccaneers also lost receivers Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and running back Leonard Fournette.

But they hope to have Godwin back for the playoffs and also look forward to the return of Antonio Brown, who has been suspended for the past three games for misrepresenting his COVID vaccination status by allegedly using a fake vaccination card.     And although Sunday wasn't his best game, it never hurts to have Tom Brady on your side when the chips are down.Also Read: What happened to Buccaneers WR Chris Godwin?     "", '""Straight hate by a guy who is jealous""- Tom Brady debate prompts Skip Bayless to take personal shots at Shannon Sharpe  Things between Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe got heated beyond anyone\'s wildest expectations during a debate about Tom Brady\'s performance in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\' embarrassing 35-7 loss to Brock Purdy the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.  During Monday\'s episode of Undisputed on FS1, Sharpe was highly critical of Brady\'s performance, calling out the quarterback for his poor performance while passing the ball. Brady completed only 34 of his 55 pass attempts for 253 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.         Tom Brady debate sparks petty argument between Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe           Bayless offered poor retorts to Sharpe\'s legitimate criticism of Tom Brady\'s performance, before accusing the NFL Hall of Famer of being jealous of the seven-time Super Bowl champion. When Sharpe called out Bayless for claiming that Brady watches more film than the Buccaneers coaching staff and that the quarterback was the one to blame for the team\'s blowout loss against the 49ers, the latter responded: ""This is straight hate by a guy who is jealous that he\'s still playing at a high level at 45, when you [Sharpe] had to stop at 35. That\'s the point."" Sharpe replied: ""Skip, that\'s what you do. Every time I call something into question, [you claim] I am jealous. I did what I did. You make it sound like I was a bum. I\'m in the NFL Hall of Fame. I got three Super Bowls.""     Bayless snapped back: ""So what? [Brady\'s] way better than you were!"" A visibly upset Sharpe took his glasses off and continued to argue his case: ""You are willing to take a personal shot at me. To say this man is better than me because I said he\'s playing bad this year?"" Watch the entire argument below:     Bayless responded that Sharpe\'s comments about Tom Brady were disrespectful and the former NFL star responded that the veteran analyst\'s jibe at him was just as disrespectful. The argument eventually cooled down after Sharpe took a backseat and allowed Bayless to make his case and defend Brady\'s performance against the 49ers. What started off as a passionate debate devolved into a petty argument.      ']"
15,Jeff Driskel,"[""3 observations from the Houston Texans-Dallas Cowboys preseason matchup  The Dallas Cowboys are still searching for their first win of the preseason after a disappointing loss to the Houston Texans Saturday night. Jerry Jones' boys have one more shot against the Jacksonville Jaguars next week, and that game has now become more critical.  Unlike the Cowboys, the Houston Texans are heading into their preseason finale undefeated. With everything the Texans have gone through this offseason, finishing their preseason undefeated will be a massive win. The Texans may not be a dumpster fire after all.        Here are three observations from the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans' Week 2 preseason matchup.            Houston Texans rookie QB Davis Mills has shined during the preseason #1 Houston Texans starting QB job looks to belong to Davis Mills The Houston Texans entered their offseason with a massive question mark next to their quarterback position. One thing that was for sure in Houston was that Deshaun Watson wouldn't be playing. That left the Houston Texans with Davis Mills, Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel.     All three of Davis Mills' longest completions tonight are play-action strikes. pic.twitter.com/OpTTA9LAeo‚Äî Rivers McCown (@riversmccown) August 22, 2021 Davis Mills has outperformed both Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel over the last two preseason games. Mills completed 11 of his 22 passes for 112 yards and an interception against the Packers in Week 1. He followed that above-average performance by completing ten of his sixteen passes for 115 yards against the Cowboys. It looks like Davis Mills will head into Week 1 of the regular season as the starting quarterback in Houston. That's if a miracle doesn't happen and Deshaun Watson suddenly changes his mind.      #2 Dallas Cowboys are still searching for Dak Prescott's backup The Dallas Cowboys headed into their preseason matchup with the Houston Texans with three quarterbacks battling for one job. That job is backing up their franchise quarterback Dak Prescott. Garrett Gilbert, Cooper Rush and Ben DiNucci are all fighting for the backup role. COWBOYS GAME REPLAY üé¨: Cooper Rush connects with Cedrick Wilson for the go ahead TD! ‚ú≠ #dallascowboys pic.twitter.com/Sb0K4UbAuG‚Äî The Cowboys Network (@TheCowboysNet) August 22, 2021 After the Hall of Fame Game, it looked like Garrett Gilbert would run away with the job. Cooper Rush bounced back against the Cardinals to prove he's not out of the race just yet. Ben DiNucci led the Cowboys in passing yards against the Texans, but he threw three interceptions.     With the Cowboys' preseason finale approaching quickly, Josh Rosen is starting to look even better. All three quarterbacks have had good and bad performances, making the Cowboys' backup quarterback spot an open race heading into their finale against Jacksonville.  #3 Dallas Cowboys haven't scored a rushing touchdown during the preseason The Dallas Cowboys fan base has been focused on the quarterback position and their defense. That has taken the attention away from their rushing attack. Dallas hasn't recorded a rushing touchdown in its three preseason games. Ezekiel Elliott hasn't appeared in any of the Cowboys' preseason games, but that doesn't take away their struggles. The Cowboys need their run game if they want Dak to have a successful season. With one preseason game left, the Cowboys will need their run game to find the end zone to build momentum heading into the upcoming season.Also Check Out: Complete Dallas Cowboys NFL Preseason Schedule 2021     "", ""Broncos QBs since Peyton Manning: Every starter since Hall of Famer retired in 2016  Ever since Peyton Manning retired in 2016, after winning his second Super Bowl overall and his first with the Denver Broncos, the franchise has gone through upheaval every year at the quarterback position. It is a notoriously difficult place to fill at the best of times, but it is especially difficult when someone is trying to replace an all-time great like Peyton Manning.  We take a look at every starter who has played for the Denver Broncos in that position since Peyton Manning's retirement. As this has been such an unstable position for the franchise after Peyton Manning, in most seasons, they have had multiple starters in the given position. So, for the purposes of clarity, only those who started most games are listed at the top and others who played in those seasons are mentioned separately.                       Denver Broncos quarterbacks since Peyton Manning retired 2016 and 2017 - Trevor Siemian Right after Peyton Manning retired, Brock Osweiler, who had started some of the games the previous year with Peyton Manning in their Super Bowl-winning season, left for the Houston Texans to become their starter. That opened up the field for third-choice Trevor Siemian to compete with rookie Paxton Lynch and veteran Mark Sanchez, and Siemian eventually became the starter.     James Palmer@JamesPalmerTVTrevor Siemian is the only QB with a winning record for the #Broncos since Peyton Manning retired entering the 2016 seasonTrevor Siemian (13-11), Case Keenum (6-10), Paxton Lynch (1-3), Joe Flacco (0-4) and Brock Osweiler (0-4)35588 In 2016, he played 14 of 16 games for the Denver Broncos (the last two weeks were quarterbacked by Paxton Lynch) and established himself as the first choice. Even though the Broncos missed the playoffs, he finished with a passer rating of 84.6 that was higher than Peyton Manning and Brock Osweiler from the previous season. Over the last six weeks of his season from Weeks 8 to 14, he averaged more than 300 yards, behind only Tom Brady and Kirk Cousins. He was named a Pro Bowl alternate but did not accept the invitation due to the shoulder surgery he went ahead with after Week 14.        In 2017, now firmly established as a starter but under new coach Vance Joseph, he began the season strongly, and the high point was a game against the Dallas Cowboys where he threw four touchdowns. In Week 6, he suffered a shoulder injury. Then, over the next few weeks, his production declined. He was benched in favor of the returning Brock Osweiler in Week 9, who was himself then relieved by Paxton Lynch in Week 12. After Lynch was injured in that game, Siemian got another chance to lead the Broncos. But another shoulder injury in Week 15 spelled the end of his career with the Broncos as Brock Osweiler relieved him in that game and started in Week 16.     2018 - Case Keenum After the upheaval of the previous season, when the Broncos had three quarterbacks trading places, head coach Vance Joseph chose to reunite with former Houston Texans quarterback Case Keenum, who they traded from the Minnesota Vikings. They stuck with him throughout the season and he started all 16 games as the Broncos went 6-10.    He threw for 3,890 yards with a 62.3 completion rate. He had 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, with a 81.2 passer rating. He was traded to the Washington Redskins for a seventh-round pick in 2019.     2019 - Joe Flacco In 2019, the Denver Broncos decided to go with Joe Flacco, who had won one Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens. There were eerie parallels with Peyton Manning as they plumped for a veteran quarterback and former Super Bowl MVP. He was named the starter and had the job until he faced a neck injury in Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts. In those eight games that he started, he had 1,822 passing yards, six touchdowns, five interceptions, and an 85.1 passer rating. He was subsequently released by the Broncos and went on to sign with the New York Jets, where he still is currently.        After Joe Flacco was injured, he was replaced by Brandon Allen for three games before Drew Lock stepped in for the final five games of the season. The rookie quarterback finished with 1,020 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions in those five games and equalled John Elway's franchise record for most wins by a rookie in Broncos history. His four wins came in just five games compared to the 10 taken by Elway. Peter Baugh@Peter_BaughDrew Lock's rookie year stats for the #Broncos: ‚Ä¢5 games played ‚Ä¢1,020 yards (204 a game)‚Ä¢7 TD‚Ä¢3 interceptions ‚Ä¢4-1 record776 2020 - Drew Lock For his performances the previous season, Lock was named the starter for 2020. In Week 2, he injured his shoulder and would not return until Week 6. During that period, Jeff Driskel and Brett Rypien started one game each. In Week 12, due to a COVID outbreak among the quarterback corps, running back Phillip Lindsay started under center.     Lock's performances in his second season were not up to standard. Case in point, he had 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. This was the joint highest in the league , tied with Carson Wentz, despite Lock only playing 13 matches. His 57.3 completion rate was the lowest among all quarterbacks with, at least, 150 passing attempts that season.    2021 - Teddy Bridgewater In 2021, Teddy Bridgewater, the 2015 Pro Bowler, joined the team from the Carolina Panthers. He beat out Drew Lock to become the starter, though Lock started three games in each of which Bridgewater was out injured. In the 13 games that he started, he threw for 3,052 yards, 18 touchdowns, and seven interceptions for a passer rating of 94.9 with a 66.9 completion percentage. At the end of the season, he was traded to the Miami Dolphins as the Denver Broncos acquired Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks.     2022 - Russell Wilson   Russell Wilson joined from the Seattle Seahawks. In a deal that sent Drew Lock to Seattle, along with other players and draft picks, the future hall-of-famer joined the Denver Broncos for a five-year, $245 million deal. The Broncos will hope to replicate the success they had with Peyton Manning when they last had a future hall-of-famer as their quarterback.     ""]"
16,David Blough,"[""Is DeAndre Hopkins playing today against the Falcons? Week 17 injury update for the Cardinals WR  As per NFL Insider Jordan Schultz, DeAndre Hopkins has been declared out for today's game against the Atlanta Falcons. The Arizona Cardinals' injury woes have gotten worse as their season looks set to end with a whimper rather than a bang.  Before being seen leaving the practice pitch on Friday, Hopkins was a full participant on Wednesday and Thursday. Kliff Kingsbury later that day informed the press that the All-Pro wide receiver was doubtful to play because of knee problems during training. Colt McCoy, the second-string quarterback, has also been ruled out due to concussion-like symptoms.        Jordan Schultz@Schultz_ReportDeAndre Hopkins is OUT Sunday vs the #Falcons, sources tell @theScore. #AZCardinals are currently listing DHop as questionable with a knee, but I‚Äôm told he won‚Äôt make the trip to Atlanta. David Blough will start at QB, with Colt McCoy in concussion protocol.17257           For the seventh time this season, Hopkins will miss a game. The veteran wideout sat out the first six games of the season as he was suspended for testing positive for performance enhancing drugs. The Cardinals will start David Blough at quarterback today, which means they will start a different quarterback in four consecutive games. After Kyler Murray, McCoy, and Trace McSorley (who faltered in his inaugural league start last weekend against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers), Blough is Arizona's latest to start under center.     How important is DeAndre Hopkins to the Arizona Cardinals? DeAndre Hopkins tops the Arizona Cardinals with 64 receptions for 717 yards and three touchdowns in only nine games. This would have put him on track for more than 120 receptions and 1,300 yards for the entire 17-game season. Given that the Cardinals (4-11) are already out of the postseason picture and have nothing to compete for in the last two games of the 2022 season, it is anticipated that Hopkins will be kept out for the remainder of the campaign. This campaign, the Atlanta Falcons' defense has given up the ninth-most points to fantasy wide receivers. Hopkins recorded a season-low one catch on 10 targets in his last game versus the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for four yards. Although backup quarterback David Blough will be in charge of the offense, Marquise Brown and Greg Dortch are expected to play a larger role today. Against the Falcons, Marquise Brown might be regarded as a low-tier WR2 and could be a solid replacement in fantasy football.     Bo Brack@BoBrackDeAndre Hopkins left the Arizona Cardinals practice field and went back inside the team facility.1536DeAndre Hopkins had only one catch for four yards on 10 targets last week in a 19-16 overtime defeat to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which was by far his poorest outing of the year. Hopkins had already accumulated at least 60 yards or a score in each of his previous games this season.     ""]"

', ""What teams has Andy Dalton played for in the NFL? Journey of the Saints' veteran QB explored  Andy Dalton currently plays for the New Orleans Saints as a quarterback. But after an ugly loss to the Baltimore Ravens in Week 9 of the 2022 NFL season, he might yet lose his place to Jameis Winston again. As has been the story of his life, he has been supplanted by other quarterbacks in the various franchises he has played for, despite not playing particularly badly.  Here, we take a look at all the teams Dalton has played for in his NFL career, starting with the Cincinnati Bengals.        Andy Dalton's journeyman career           Andy Dalton was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft. He quickly established himself as the starter and stablizied the franchise. While there, he made it to three Pro Bowls and took the Bengals towards a sustained period of success in the regular season. The issues cam in the postseason. He could never win a game in the playoffs, and while the Bengals kept faith with him for a long time, they let him go in 2019 for Joe Burrow. Suffice to say, this decision has been vindicated based on last season's performances in Cincinnati. Kevin Cole@KevinColePFFWho can guess which one of these Bengals QB playoff performances is Joe Burrow and which are Andy Dalton?32227     Dalton went to the Dallas Cowboys in 2020 but found himself the backup to Dak Prescott. He was a thorough professional during that time and performed admirably when Prescott was out injured. That earned him a chance with the Chicago Bears in 2021, where he was named the starter ahead of Justin Fields and Nick Foles. Dalton knew that his time as a starter in Chicago was going to be limited, as Fields was being groomed to take over. However, he could not have imagined how soon that would be. He was supplanted as the started in the middle of the season and Justin Fields was given the reins. Dalton played only eight games for Chicago last season and moved on to the New Orleans Saints this season. He got his chance in Week 2, after starting quarterback Jameis Winston went down injured. He started for the next five games, and even when Winston returned, Andy Dalton was named the starting quarterback for Week 9. Yet, in primetime, he again wilted.     trey wingo@wingozWith the loss tonight Andy Dalton QB‚Äôed teams will fall to 6-20 in prime time games. Of the 50 QBs with at least 20 prime time starts that puts him 49th out 50. And The @Saints still have another prime time game this season5516Whether the Saints' current problems damage his chances with the franchise remains to be seen. However, he is quickly running out of wiggle room to resurrect his career anywhere else in the NFL. In his career Dalton has thrown for 36,454 yards, 235 touchdowns and 139 interceptions. We will see what the future holds for Andy Dalton     "", 'Top 10 TCU Football players of all time  The TCU Horned Frogs are readying themselves for a huge championship clash against Georgia, but who are the top 10 TCU representatives of all time?  The modern era has produced fewer greats from Texas Christian University than in previous years, although Andy Dalton and LaDainian Tomlinson are the two standouts of the 2000s.        Only one player from the university has even won the Heisman Trophy, and that was Davey O‚ÄôBrien, although 2022‚Äôs Max Duggan was the runner-up in the voting for the award.           Duggan was the figurehead of the 2022 Horned Frogs, leading the team from the quarterback position and registering a 13-1 record for the season, one game behind the Georgia Bulldogs. Having been a slow-burner in terms of his development, Duggan‚Äôs draft stock isn‚Äôt too high; he isn‚Äôt considered among the elite QBs of the class, but his performances this year can‚Äôt be ignored. Who are the 10 best TCU players of all-time?  #10 Max Duggan (2019 ‚Äì 2022) Vrbo Fiesta Bowl - Michigan v TCU     Max Duggan led Texas Christian University to the national championship game in 2022 and has done so in spectacular style. It‚Äôs unclear whether or not he has the natural talent to be a starting quarterback in the NFL, but his collegiate career will go down as one of the greatest in TCU history. In 2022 he finished as a runner-up in the Heisman Trophy voting after throwing for 3,321 yards, 30 touchdowns, and a completion percentage of 64.9. #9 Jim Swink (1955 - 1957) Swink was an All-American running back during his years with the Horned Frogs, and he is remembered as one of the very best to ever play the position in the Southwest Conference. Swink‚Äôs collegiate performances were impressive, leading the team to back-to-back Conference Championships, although he was only a second-round draft choice by the Chicago Bears in the NFL. The rusher was almost a Heisman Trophy winner for TCU, but he fell short, being voted as a runner-up.     #8 Jason Verrett (2011 - 2013) San Diego Chargers v Kansas City Chiefs Verrett was one of the greatest athletes to ever compete for the Horned Frogs. Whilst playing all across the secondary throughout his college football career, he also excelled in track and field. In a 2007 100m dash, he recorded a time of 11.87 seconds. This was a major boost to his game on the football field. He initially represented Santa Rosa Junior College, but a year later transferred to TCU. In his debut year, he recorded 58 tackles as a cornerback, albeit sometimes playing as a safety, and then in 2012 he had 63 tackles and six interceptions, the highest of all the team‚Äôs defenders.     His brilliant college career in Texas propelled Verrett to the third-ranked cornerback prospect in the country, and he was then drafted 25th overall by the San Diego Chargers. #7 Larry Brown (1989 ‚Äì 1991) Super Bowl XXVII: Buffalo Bills v Dallas Cowboys Larry Brown is another great athlete who split his time between football and other athletics. Whilst eventually a defensive star, he also played running back at times. TCU made him their starting left cornerback after transferring to the college as a junior, and he recorded 75 tackles, two interceptions, and 10 successful pass defenses.     In the Blue-Gray Football Classic, where he was invited as one of the nation‚Äôs best defenders, Brown earned the MVP award after making nine tackles. Brown would go on to play for the Dallas Cowboys, Oakland Raiders and Minnesota Vikings in the NFL. #6 Aaron Schobel (1997 ‚Äì 2001) Buffalo Bills v New England Patriots In his three seasons with the TCU Horned Frogs, Aaron Schobel was a productive pass rusher. He managed to dominate O-Lines at the college level due to his side and explosive first-step. In 2000 he was voted the WAC Defensive Player of the Year.     By the time Schobel left Texas Christian, he was the team‚Äôs all-time leader in sacks after registering 31 throughout his college career. His NFL career began as a second-round pick for the Buffalo Bills, but is most remembered due to the fact Schobel is the player who has recorded the most NFL sacks on Tom Brady. #5 Andy Dalton (2007 ‚Äì 2011) New Orleans Saints v Philadelphia Eagles Andy Dalton was a brilliant quarterback for the TCU Horned Frogs. He never threw for less than 2,200 yards in his four seasons with the program.     His breakthrough year came in 2010 when he threw for 2,857 yards and 27 touchdowns, earning him a second-round draft selection by the Cincinnati Bengals. #4 Sammy Baugh (1935 ‚Äì 1938) ""Slingin‚Äô Sam Baugh"" revolutionized how college football was played during his career with the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs. He threw the ball with reckless abandon, but gained incredible yardage. Throughout his college career, he recorded 39 touchdown passes and amassed 3,384 passing yards at a time when they were much harder to get. #3 Bob Lilly (1958 ‚Äì 1960) Nobody is more synonymous with Texas football than ""Mr. Cowboy"" Bob Lilly. He was an integral part of TCU‚Äôs football program in the late 1950s and is one of their most famous alumni. His tough-nosed defensive play was brutal, but effective for the Horned Frogs, who under his guidance were able to have a defense that allowed eight points per game. #2 Davey O‚ÄôBrien (1936 ‚Äì 1938) Davey O‚ÄôBrien has gone down in history as the only TCU player to win the Heisman Trophy award.     In the 1938 season, he threw for 1,457 passing yards and 19 touchdown passes. He was one of TCU‚Äôs greatest ever performers, being named to 13 All-America teams. He was selected fourth-overall in the NFL Draft and was the first ever Heisman Trophy winner to play in the NFL. #1 LaDainian Tomlinson (1997 ‚Äì 2001) Texas Christian V Colorado State LaDainian Tomlinson stands atop this list as one of the most consistent running backs the modern NFL has seen. He was one of the constant positive presences on a San Diego Chargers team that was never able to utilize its full potential.     Tomlinson‚Äôs 2000 season with TCU was one of the most memorable in college history.In 11 games, he rushed for 2,158 yards and scored 22 touchdowns. It earned him the Jim Brown Trophy and the WAC Offensive Player of the Year.He is an inductee in the College Football Hall of Fame and remains one of the TCU‚Äôs greatest ever products.

The New Orleans Saints will take on division rivals the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond James Stadium with Andy Dalton under center.   Both teams are coming off harsh losses, with New Orleans losing 13-0 to the San Francisco 49ers.        For Tom Brady and the Buccaneers, it was an overtime loss to the Cleveland Browns that they will want to atone for.

Saints starting QB tonight: Andy Dalton to play vs. Buccaneers     Andy Dalton will make his 13th start in an away primetime game tonight. Unfortunately, for Dalton, he is an incredible 0-12 in road games during primetime. That will not instill much confidence at all. Even if there was any left after last week's 13-0 loss to the 49ers, coming up against Brady and the Buccaneers promises to be a tough task.    But it might not be all doom and gloom for Saints fans. New Orleans does have one arrow in their quiver. Dennis Allen.     One team that has consistently given Brady trouble and that has been Allen's Saints. Defensively, they have the 45-year-old quarterback's number and will be hoping to create short fields for Dalton and co tonight.  Saints aiming to keep season alive vs. Buccaneers Sitting at 4-8, a win over Tampa Bay could see Allen's team leapfrog from the bottom of the division to second above the 5-8 Atlanta Falcons. Both would have the same record, but New Orleans defeated Atlanta earlier in the season 27-26 so they own the tie-breaker.        That is certainly some incentive for Dalton and New Orleans, and hopefully they can put on a show for their fans. Another shutout performance is not what the team needs to dish up against Tampa tonight.With an outside shot of making the playoffs, a win tonight could be just the tonic for the New Orleans to make a late playoff dash.     "", ""Who is the New Orleans Saints starting QB tonight?  The New Orleans Saints will face off against the Arizona Cardinals in a Week 7 Thursday night matchup. This game will see two vastly different styles collide, as the run-heavy offense of the Saints will be paying a visit to the pass-first Arizona offense. The game is set, but the question of who will start under center for New Orleans is still up in the air.  Their quarterback room for has been one of the most interesting in the league since Taysom Hill joined in 2017. There has always been an air of mystery about the position due to the verstility that Hill brings. The main issue in recent times is that starting quarterback Jameis Winston has been injured. He tore his ACL last season and has had four fractured vertebrae in his back this campaign. With his return imminent, will he start in Week 7?        Though it is not 100% certain, Andy Dalton looks set to get the nod against the Cardinals.           Winston is simply too valuable to risk rushing back, especially with the nature of his injury. With Dalton available, the likelihood is that Winston will be nursed back slowly. How have the Saints' quarterbacks faired this season? Seattle Seahawks v New Orleans Saints Andy Dalton is a backup QB who has started in Winston's absence. He is a solid quarterback and a decent safety blanket for a team built around the running talents of perennial Pro Bowler Alvin Kamara. With Winston training this week, his return is coming soon.     New Orleans' quarterback play has been a mixed bag this season, with their performances being inconsistent. Winston has played four games this season and has racked up four touchdowns and five interceptions. Dalton has played in the last three games and has racked up three touchdowns against a lone interception. Then there's Taysom Hill, the Saints' Swiss army knife. He is so versatile that he can't seem to lock up any position. He plays backup for Dalton and Winston at QB and is also a tight end. He rarely plays under center, but when he does, it's usually to run the ball on important downs.With their season quickly falling away from them, the 2-4 New Orleans need to come away with a win in Week 7 against the Cardinals.     "", 'Andy Dalton or Justin Fields: Matt Nagy reveals who will be Bears\' starting QB in Week 5  Inspired by Russell Wilson, quarterback Justin Fields flashed the skills that made him the No. 11 overall pick in the draft. That was precisely what the Chicago Bears needed.  Fields brushed off a nightmarish first start, and the Bears bounced back from one of the worst offensive performances in NFL history to beat the still winless Detroit Lions 24-14 on Sunday at Soldier Field.        Fields and the Bears (2-2) were in much better form, coming off a brutal loss to the Cleveland Browns at FirstEnergy Stadium last week. They scored touchdowns on their first two possessions and rang up 373 total yards.           Last Sunday, against the Browns, the Bears gained 68 yards on air and 46 on the ground, totalling 114 yards. But the team lost 67 yards on nine sacks, so they were held by the Browns to a grand total of 47 yards, the ninth-lowest total in NFL history. The Bears QB Fields stated that he did not feel too bad about the previous week as it pushed the team towards improvement. ""I saw Russell Wilson posted a tweet this past week saying, \'I love adversity,\' and I truly do love that because it just brings a whole different person out of me. And in some ways, I\'m glad last week happened. I think if we would\'ve won last week, it wouldn\'t have pushed us as much to get better and practice hard.""     Fields looked more comfortable, completing 11 of 17 passes for 209 yards in his second consecutive start with Andy Dalton sidelined because of a bone bruise in his left knee. The former Ohio State star threw an interception. But he was also sacked just once, a significant improvement after being taken down nine times for 67 yards while throwing for just 68 the previous week. Was it enough to supplant Dalton as the No. 1 quarterback? Head coach Matt Nagy didn\'t say. ""All we wanted to do, quite honestly, today was win the game, go to 2-2 and be able to talk about everything else as we go. You guys know in regards to Andy, we\'re working through what he went through this past week, so we\'ll see where he\'s at."" The Bears HC declared after the game.

Teams know what Dalton can do, and most importantly, what he cannot do. Conversely, Fields is still a mystery. He has tons of potential, and his ceiling is way higher than Dalton\'s.

Following some recent comments from Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum, the longtime analyst expects better from one of the NBA\'s brightest young talents.   Following Game 2 of the NBA Finals, Tatum opened up about him being an emerging superstar in the league. More notably, he brought up that he never said it himself, the title was thrust upon him by others. Colin Cowherd did not like the response and is worried about his apparent self-doubt.

', '5 takeaways from the Arizona Cardinals\' Week 6 win over the Dallas Cowboys | NFL 2020  In their first full game without franchise quarterback Dak Prescott, the Dallas Cowboys -- now led by former Cincinnati Bengals QB Andy Dalton -- suffered a 38-10 home defeat against the Arizona Cardinals on ""Monday Night Football"" to close out Week 6.  Led by native Texan QB Kyler Murray, who had never lost at AT&T Stadium in high school or college, the Cardinals just had too much on both sides of the ball for a depleted and shell-shocked looking Cowboys team.        Murray didn\'t have his best day throwing the football either, completing just over a third of his passes (9-of-24). For most QBs this would usually indicate a poor performance; not for Murray, though. The diminutive Cardinals\' star found receiver Christian Kirk for two touchdowns, rushed for 74 yards and a TD himself, and Murray didn\'t commit any turnovers.           The real star of the show for the Cardinals was running back Kenyan Drake, who finished with 164 rushing yards and two touchdowns. Drake started this season slow, but Monday\'s performance could be a positive sign of things to come. Without the league\'s most productive QB, the Cowboys struggled to convert on third downs all too often, and the late-fourth quarter ""garbage time"" touchdown pass from Dalton to receiver Amari Cooper did little to improve the spirits of Cowboys fans. The Cardinals were by far and away the better team, and everybody knew it by the time this one was over. Let\'s take a look at five takeaways from this NFC matchup.      5. Filling Dak Prescott\'s shoes is going to be just as impossible as expected for the Cowboys Arizona Cardinals v Dallas Cowboys It\'ll hardly be a surprise for anyone to read, but I have to mention that Andy Dalton struggled to fill Dak Prescott\'s boots on MNF. Give the guy credit where it is due: Dalton toughed it out in the pocket, throwing the ball often and getting hit often. He finished the game 34 of 54 for 266 yards through the air. At the very least, this game will have served as great practice for the man now tasked with taking the Cowboys to the playoffs.     Up against a talented, confident Cardinals defense, however, Dalton did throw two picks, and his one touchdown came when the game had already been decided. I don\'t wish to hang Dalton out to dry; it\'s just that anyone who watched the game could see that the Cowboys receivers missed Prescott\'s more dynamic and fearless approach. That\'s why one of the league\'s most exciting and productive offenses had to wait until the fourth quarter before getting into the end zone.  4. Cardinals\' opponents needs to game plan for Budda Baker Arizona Cardinals safety Budda Baker     The Cardinals had a great day on defense against the Cowboys. All facets flowed together: the pass rush was consistent; the coverage tight, the intensity noticeable from the start, and they finished the game with four turnovers. So it feels unfair to pick out just one player for praise, but can we all just take a moment to acknowledge that Budda Baker is one of the league\'s best safeties? Baker\'s uncanny ability to position himself in the thick of the action led him to finish with seven tackles, one tackle-for-loss, one sack and an interception. Any opponent of the Cardinals -- they play the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7 -- had better factor Baker\'s presence into their offensive schemes. His omnipresent style will be a problem for anyone, even league MVP front-runner Russell Wilson.  3. The Cowboys\' playmakers went missing Arizona Cardinals v Dallas Cowboys     Dalton wasn\'t the only reason the Cowboys\' offense struggled on Monday night. Big names were expected to stand up in the absence of Prescott and carry the mantle, but too many of them disappeared. Running back Ezekiel Elliot coughed the ball up twice in one game for the first time in his pro career. Wide receiver Micheal Gallup had a night to forget; he caught just two of six targets and dropped a dime of a pass from Dalton in the end zone.  2. The Cardinals\' running game is a legit threat Arizona Cardinals\' Kenyan Drake     Coming into this Week 6 clash, people were beginning to question the offensive production of Arizona running back Kenyan Drake. There was some belief that he was a goal-line threat but lacked the ability to consistently post up big numbers -- this coming after the Alabama product had failed to run for more than 100 yards in any of Arizona\'s first five games. Now Drake sits fourth in the NFL in rushing, and suddenly the Cardinals are a real threat on the ground. Funny what just one week can do. The Cowboys\' defense simply couldn\'t cope as they allowed Drake to help himself to two TDs and 164 yards on the ground (8.2 yards per carry). Cardinals\' fans will hope their top back is now able to consistently put these kinds of performances up against some of the league\'s far-sterner defenses.  1. The Cowboys\' defense is not very good     Arizona Cardinals v Dallas Cowboys Dallas linebacker Jaylon Smith played his heart out and finished the game with 10 solo tackles, so he\'s exempt from this critique. Take Smith out of this Cowboys\' defense, though, and I\'m afraid there\'s just not that much to like about this unit. It\'s not that they\'re terrible ... it\'s not even that they\'re bad\' ... they\'re just not very good. The Cowboys struggled to get ahold of Cardinals QB Kyler Murray, getting to him just once for a sack. The edge rushers and linebackers need to up the pass rush going forward.     Dallas was able to defend well as a unit for large parts of the night. They just didn\'t seem to have enough talent out there to come up with big plays on defense, not forcing any turnovers. The Cowboys\' inability to defend is ultimately what would have cost them a genuine chance at the Super Bowl this year even if Dak had stayed healthy.Can anyone tell me the last time a team conceding a league-high 36 points per game made a run at the championship?Perhaps this is something Jerry Jones will look to address during the offseason ... unless a flashy wide receiver becomes available, I mean.Also Read: What is Jerry Jones‚Äô Net Worth?

That\'s definitely possible. At one point during the NFL draft process, Justin Fields was the second-ranked quarterback in this year\'s draft class. The Chicago Bears should definitely revisit the trade for Russell Wilson and offer Justin Fields, a defensive veteran and two first-round draft picks.

Is Justin Fields enough to land Russell Wilson? CFP National Championship Presented by AT&T - Ohio State v Alabama It\'s hard to say if Justin Fields is enough to bring Russell Wilson to Chicago as the draft pick hasn\'t played a single snap in the NFL yet. If Pete Carroll were to watch Justin Fields\' college film, he would see that Fields is a younger version of Russell Wilson. Both of them play the quarterback position and share a lot of similarities.     .@justnfields says he\'s going to do whatever it takes to be the #Bears QB1 pic.twitter.com/GqKZASdXVP‚Äî FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) May 14, 2021 Russell Wilson is mobile and can deliver an accurate football on the run. One thing that stood out about Justin Fields during his college career was his ability to throw accurately on the run without losing velocity on his throws. Early signs indicate Fields is faster than Wilson and has better arm strength. Both have baseball backgrounds that have helped them become successful at the quarterback position. Like Wilson, Justin Fields plays his best football under pressure and showed at Ohio State that he\'s a natural leader.     Pete Carroll would be a fool if he didn\'t even consider accepting the offer to bring Justin Fields to Seattle. Russell Wilson isn\'t getting any younger and is starting to slowly decline. Why not bring in Russell Wilson 2.0 by trading for Justin Fields? It\'ll be interesting to see if the Bears actually revisit the Russell Wilson trade, and if Justin Fields\' name pops up in the conversation.     ', ""Who is XFL's passing leader heading into Week 3?

Passing yards leading quarterbacks over the first two weeks aren't uncommon names for NFL fans.           XFL passing yards leaders: former NFL quarterbacks dominate the list If you look at the top three quarterbacks in passing yards, they have all played in the NFL. One of them has even started a playoff game, while another has led the Dallas Cowboys in a primetime matchup against bitter rivals the Philadelphia Eagles. Ben DiNucci of the Seattle Sea Dragons dominates in passing yards throughout the two weeks with 478; Brandon Silvers from the Houston Roughnecks is second with 445, while A.J. McCarron, the former Cincinnati Bengals and Alabama quarterback who now defends the St. Louis BattleHawks, is third with 374.     McCarron is the most famous of them all. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in 2014 and spent four years as Andy Dalton's backup, even starting a playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He also had stints with the Buffalo Bills, the Las Vegas Raiders, the Houston Texans, and the Atlanta Falcons. DiNucci did not have much success in his NFL career, spending two seasons with the Dallas Cowboys before being cut. He did start a Sunday Night Football game for them, but it was not the greatest backup performance of all time, to say the least.Silvers played college football at Troy and spent an offseason with the New York Jets, but unlike the others in the top 3, he never played in an NFL game.

""Cam was a guy that I wasn\'t that big a fan of, honestly. He earned a lot of credit. And a lot of like, I turned the corner a little bit, not obviously, his play was atrocious. But like he did in New England, they liked him in New England, like you get along with Belichick. And they think you work hard and grind. Like, I respect that. It\'s not I don\'t think I would have lasted the New England. I\'ve got to know a couple people that worked there for a long time. Like, it\'s hard.

It was an ordeal for Mac Jones as he completed 22 of 32 passes for 321 yards but threw three interceptions. His night only got worse as, with a couple of minutes left to play, he suffered a leg injury.            Further tests are required to understand the exact nature of the injury, but there appear to be fears that it could be tendon or ligament damage. That did not show up on the preliminary X-Ray done today, but more details are expected after further medical testing on Monday.

Beyond the Monster@BeyondtheMnstrMac Jones hobbling off the field. #Patriots ‚Ä¢ #ForeverNE 5     Mac Jones has an excellent injury record and durability, but there will be concerns that he has previously been injured in college while playing for the University of Alabama and in the Senior Bowl. He initially suffered a bone bruise in 2021 while in Alabama, but it did not lead to any missed snaps. In the second case, he injured both ankles and was forced to miss the game altogether. Last year, he did not have any injury problems behind a steady offensive line and started all 17 regular season games. The extent of the injury, as highlighted before, is not known, but there is a good chance that he may miss 2-4 weeks, including the New England Patriots' next game against the Green Bay Packers. In such circumstances, they would have to rely on either Brian Hoyer or rookie Bailey Zappe.    Losing Mac Jones would be a huge blow to Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots. Even though it is early in the season, they have begun it 1-2 after their latest loss and sit fourth in the AFC East. The offense was already stuttering as they scored only 17 points in their solitary win against the equally uninspiring Pittsburgh Steelers, but if Jones were to miss a major chunk of the season, it would only go uphill from here.     "", ""Top 5 Browns quarterback since 2000.\xa0  The Cleveland Browns returned to the NFL in 1999 after a four-year absence and were consistently one of the weakest teams in the league for two decades. The Browns have won just 112 of the 352 games they have played in the NFL since their return to the league on the cusp of the new millennium.  One of the primary reasons for their poor record since 1999 is their lack of consistency at quarterback. Prior to Baker Mayfield, only Tim Couch started all 16 games of a season, doing so in 2001.        Close to two decades after their return to the NFL, the Browns simply couldn't draft, sign, or trade for a franchise star before picking Mayfield with the first pick of the 2018 NFL draft. Since 1999, the team has astonishingly had eight seasons with more than three starting quarterbacks.            Ranking Cleveland Browns‚Äô top 5 QB since 1999 Before drafting Mayfield, the Browns started 29 different quarterbacks from 1999 to 2018. While the team has had terrible luck at QB, a few did manage to impress, albeit for a short spell. Here are the five best Cleveland Browns QBs since 1999.      #5 - Brian Hoyer New Orleans Saints v Cleveland Browns The Browns have had no quarterback more likable than Brian Hoyer. The Cleveland-native was signed as an undrafted free agent by the New England Patriots in 2009. He spent three years with the team before being released. He was signed during the 2012 season by the Pittsburgh Steelers as a backup to third-choice QB Charlie Batch after injuries to Ben Roethlisberger and Byron Leftwich. He was released without playing a single snap and was then signed by the Arizona Cardinals, where he played in the final two games of the regular season.     He returned home to Cleveland, signing with the Browns in the 2013 NFL offseason. He started three games and won them all in the 2013 campaign but an ACL tear prematurely ended a promising campaign. In the 2014 season, the team started 6-3 with Hoyer as the starter but lost three out of the next four to all but end their playoff hopes. For a brief period, Hoyer seemed to be the answer to the QB conundrum in Cleveland, but it wasn't to be and he was released at the end of the 2014 season. #4 - Derek Anderson Cleveland Browns v Washington Redskins     After taking over from Charlie Frye in the second quarter of the 2007 season opener, Derek Anderson made the QB position in Cleveland his own with some stellar performances. He led the Browns to a 10-6 record, narrowly missing out on a playoff berth. Anderson threw for 3,787 passing yards with 29 touchdowns passes. He was named as a replacement for Tom Brady at the 2008 NFL Pro Bowl after the then-Patriots QB pulled out due to an injury. But much like his predecessors, Anderson couldn't prove himself to be the Browns' long-term answer at QB. He played 16 games over the next two seasons, recording 2,503 passing yards with 12 touchdown passes and 18 interceptions. #3 - Tim Couch The University of Kentucky Wildcats vs University of Florida Gators     Tim Couch was considered one of the best prospects in the 1999 NFL draft class. The Cleveland Browns, who were returning to the league after a four-year absence, picked the QB with the first overall pick. Couch's career in the NFL unraveled quickly as he failed to replicate his college heroics. He is now remembered as one of the biggest busts in draft history. In his defense, the Browns could never surround Couch with a stellar receiving core or a decent offensive line. After five seasons as the Browns' quarterback, Couch finished with a 22-37 win-loss record. He threw for 11,131 passing with 64 touchdown passes and 67 interceptions in 59 starts (62 total games) for the Browns. #2 - Kelly Holcomb Kelly Holcomb     Kelly Holcomb holds the distinct record of being the first quarterback to start in a playoffs game for the Browns after their return in 1999. He started their 2003 wildcard matchup against divisional rivals Pittsburgh Steelers. After an injury to Tim Couch, Holcomb stepped in and played two fantastic games to lead the Browns to the playoffs. Holcomb started 12 games for the Browns, played 13 in total, and threw for 3,438 passing yards with 26 touchdown passes and 21 interceptions. #1 - Baker Mayfield      In 2017, the Cleveland Browns became only the second team in NFL history after the 2008 Detroit Lions to finish a season with an 0-16 record. The Browns had the first overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft and used it to pick Oklahoma QB Baker Mayfield.After only three seasons with the Browns, Mayfield is already sixth on the list of the team's all-time passing yards leaders and fifth on touchdown passes. In 2021, Mayfield led the Browns to their first playoff appearance since 2003 and their first playoff win since 1994.The 25-year-old is already the Browns' best QB since the franchise's return to the league in 1999.

The alumnus of Michigan and Arkansas University served as a valuable asset for the Patriots, Houston Texans, and Baltimore Ravens during his seven-year NFL career.  Mallett accumulated a decent amount as a backup quarterback in the NFL. We will delve into his career earnings he achieved throughout his time in the league. So, without further ado, let's explore the impressive earnings of the late stellar QB.

Mallett left New England in 2014 to take up a new challenge in Houston with the Texans. He was equally decent as a second-string QB on a decent Texans team. Mallett earned $3,714,476 in his two-year stint with the Texans.     He left the Texans in 2015 when he joined the Baltimore Ravens. It was Ryan Mallett's last NFL assignment, and he earned $3,631,470 for his efforts. Mallett left the league 2017 with $9,516,798 in his bank account. Suitable for a career backup QB. Pat McAfee@PatMcAfeeShowThe NFL community lost a legend..Rest Easy Ryan Mallett  #PMSLive2703248 Ryan Mallett's NFL Career Timeline Ryan Mallett had a stellar college career with the Michigan Wolverines and the Arkansas Razorbacks. He was a two-time Second-team All-SEC honoree. His college football performances got him selected in the third round of the 2011 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots.     Mallett started and ended his Patriots' career as the primary backup to Tom Brady. He was inactive for 15 out of 16 regular season games and every post-season game for the Patriots' Super Bowl run. The rest of his time with the Patriots went by similarly. Tom Brady was never injured, so Mallett could only take snaps in garbage time. The New England Patriots traded Mallett to the Houston Texans in 2014 for a conditional sixth-round pick. He spent his time in Houston backing up the likes of Ryan Fitzpatrick and Brian Hoyer. The Texans released him in the middle of the 2015 season due to off-the-field reasons. Later in the 2015 season, the Baltimore Ravens elected to take a chance with Mallett and signed him to a contract. He had the best spell with the Ravens, throwing for career-highs numerous times. He stayed with the Ravens till the end of the 2017 NFL season and eventually exited the league. His overall NFL stat line was 1,835 passing yards, nine passing touchdowns, ten interceptions, and one rushing touchdown in twenty-one games.     "", ""Should the Dolphins sign Cam Newton? ‚Äì NFL Rumors  The era of Tua Tagovailoa may be going on hiatus for the Miami Dolphins after Tagovailoa suffered a rib injury and was carted off the field. In his place, Jacoby Brissett stepped up and put together a rough performance, throwing for 169 yards and an interception en route to a Week Two loss. The performance sets a dark tone for the near future.  The Dolphins, a win-now organization in 2021, could be looking to the market for anyone who can give the team a boost to weather the injury. Luckily for them, Cam Newton is available just weeks after being cut in New England. Would Cam Newton be a good fit with the Dolphins?        Dolphins diving deep for Cam Newton?           The Patriots and the Dolphins are sworn enemies but the modern-day Dolphins are heavily influenced by the team. Their head coach, Brian Flores, was a position coach under Bill Belichick. The Dolphins' roster is also sprinkled with ex-Patriots, including Jacoby Brissett, Eric Rowe and Jason McCourty. If the Patriots have already permeated the team, why not sign another ex-Patriot? ChuckModi@ChuckModi1Cam Newton went 15-1 w/Ted Ginn as #1 WR and after 4 uneventful yrs w/Bears made Greg Olsen the first TE in NFL history to have 3 straight 1000 yard seasons. If Cam were surrounded with level of talent Kirk Cousins has had in his career, he‚Äôd have a couple SB rings.10:51 AM ¬∑ Sep 12, 2021590138 The special advantage of signing Cam Newton is getting an inside scoop on the team. Of course, the Dolphins defeated the Patriots in Week 1, but the win was largely a result of Mac Jones' first start. He may be much different by the next time the two teams play. Anything the Dolphins can do to stay ahead of the Patriots should be done.     As an added bonus, by signing Cam Newton, the Dolphins would be keeping the Patriots from re-signing the quarterback if they change their minds. If something were to happen to Mac Jones, the Patriots would have no choice but to lean on Brian Hoyer. This would keep the Patriots down while keeping the Dolphins up.     The Dolphins are serious about the playoffs this season, so it makes sense to sign a quarterback who has plenty of playoff experience. It may have been a while for Cam Newton, but he has already shown he can perform in the playoffs. He knows how to deal with the pressure of the moment and can provide advice to Tagovailoa if he makes the playoffs.     Cam Newton after Super Bowl 50 between Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos Lastly, if the Dolphins somehow make the Super Bowl with Newton, they would have a quarterback who could deal with that pressure. He's already been there and, having lost one, his level of focus could elevate to a higher level. Needless to say, if Newton were to find himself in the Super Bowl again, he would dive on the fumble.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 3 TV Schedule     "", ""5 surprising cuts that happened during the NFL season  While news breaking about surprising cuts is a common occurrence in the NFL's preseason, it's fairly rare to see cuts announced in midseason ‚Äî like the news linebacker Jaylon Smith was presented with by the Dallas Cowboys this week.

Blount's stay in Pittsburgh lasted less than a season.     #2 ‚Äì Ryan Mallet, Houston Texans, October 2015 Houston Texans quarterback Ryan Mallet After a series of embarrassing events, Ryan Mallet blew his chance to establish himself as the Houston Texans starting quarterback. After being acquired by trade from the New England Patriots, head coach Bill O'Brien installed Mallet as the starter for the 2014 season but the QB only played three games before a torn pectoral muscle ended his season. Brian Hoyer beat Mallet for the starter's jersey during the 2015 preseason, and a day after the announcement, Mallet missed practice after sleeping through his alarm in scenes amplified by NFL Films' hit show Hard Knocks. The comedy of errors didn't end there. Ahead of a Week 7 road game, Mallet missed the team flight and the Texans severed ties and cut the gaff-prone QB on October 27.     #3 ‚Äì Antonio Brown, Oakland Raiders, September 2019 Antonio Brown with Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr in the 2019 preseason Another awkward scenario that played out on Hard Knocks was the tale of Antonio Brown's frozen feet. After signing a big-money deal to be the marquee signing in Jon Gruden's first year at the Oakland Raiders, Brown froze his toes by not wearing the correct protection in a cryotherapy chamber. While training alone during camp, Brown kicked up a fuss about the league's new helmet rules and refused to embrace enhanced safety gear. After making a public apology for the distractions he caused, Brown demanded his release two days before the Raiders' Week 1 game.

Some have even debated not watching the Week 7 clash between the Arizona Cardinals and the New Orleans Saints.           However, there have been plenty of excellent Thursday Night Football games in NFL history. Here are three of the best. What are the 3 best Thursday Night Football games in NFL history? #1 ‚Äì Los Angeles Rams vs San Francisco 49ers | Week 3, 2017 Los Angeles Rams vs San Francisco 49ers     Back in 2017, the Los Angeles Rams overcame the San Francisco 49ers 41-39, in what remains the highest scoring TNF game of all-time. Both teams managed to score, at least, six points in every quarter, and despite L.A. holding a 34-20 lead at one stage, this one couldn‚Äôt have been closer. QB Brian Hoyer led a late comeback by the Niners, and Carlos Hyde punched it in to make the score 41-39. However, San Francisco failed to tie the game with a two-point conversion. To add to the drama, they recovered the onside kick, but ended up turning the ball over on downs as Los Angeles came out victorious. #2 - New England Patriots vs New York Giants | Week 17, 2007 New England Patriots v New York Giants     The New England Patriots and Tom Brady completed their 16-0 regular season in 2007 during a Week 17 clash with the eventual Super Bowl champions, the New York Giants, on TNF. The Pats were in danger of blowing a perfect season as they found themselves 15 points down in the fourth quarter of the game at Metlife Stadium. However, Tom Brady did what he does and led New England to a historic comeback victory. Despite Brady throwing his 50th touchdown of the season in this game, the Giants would get their revenge a month later after Eli Manning beat Brady to win the Super Bowl. #3 - Green Bay Packers vs Detroit Lions | Week 13, 2015 Green Bay Packers v Detroit Lions     Aaron Rodgers capped off a heroic comeback in true Rodgers style back in 2015, when the Green Bay Packers beat division rivals Detroit Lions 27-23 on Thursday Night Football.

In fact, Parker stated that if Brady does decide to play, he would boycott any game in which Brady participates. Parker expressed his sentiments during an episode of ""The Odd Couple"" with Chris Broussard.  ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs done playing and hope he‚Äôs done playing. Like enough. Can we move on and talk about somebody else, please? When somebody is around that long, it gets tiresome more than anything.""

I‚Äôm done with Tom Brady.‚Äù              Speculation about Brady\'s return gained momentum after he purchased a minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders.  Meanwhile, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo hasn\'t passed the physical after discovering that he needs additional surgery for the foot injury he suffered last season.      Parker also criticized Brady\'s struggles in navigating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\' offense. ‚ÄúThey were terrible in the red zone, and it was awful to watch. I‚Äôm done. This past season the Bucs were 25th in scoring, they averaged 18.4 points, were 3-4 in their final 7 games‚Äî scored more than 20 points just twice, barely winning the terrible NFC South.‚Äù ‚ÄúTom Brady had the lowest touchdown percentage‚Äî 3.4%, and the second-lowest yards per attempt, 6.4; third-lowest air-yards per attempt, 6.5, and his career-low QBR‚Äî52.5. He was awful last year.‚Äù Although Brady set an NFL record with 490 completions during the 2022 regular season, his yardage and touchdown numbers were relatively modest with 4,694 yards and 25 touchdowns. While he did manage 351 passing yards and two touchdowns in the Wild Card Round game against the Dallas Cowboys, it wasn\'t enough to overcome Dallas\' dominant 31-14 performance.     Jimmy Garoppolo\'s injury could be an opening for Tom Brady\'s potential return Garoppolo, Brady\'s former teammate with the New England Patriots, agreed to a three-year, $72.75 million deal with the Raiders. However, the contract\'s validity depends on Garoppolo passing a physical examination. Reports of an injury-related addendum in the contract have fueled speculation.  If Garoppolo is unable to play for Las Vegas, the Raiders would be left with limited quarterback options, such as Brian Hoyer, Aidan O\'Connell, and Chase Garbers. In this scenario, Brady could step in until the Raiders potentially draft a quarterback in the following year. Despite Brady\'s connection with the Raiders\' top brass, Parker remains skeptical about the likelihood of Brady joining the AFC West team. ‚ÄúI do get it, in a vacuum when you just go and connect the dots, then right, Tom Brady is connecting the dots with somebody he‚Äôs had a long-stand relationship with [Josh McDaniels], and you can make the case, but I just don‚Äôt see it happening.‚Äù     ']"

He continued: ""I will not refer to Justin Herbert as a social media quarterback again until Week 18 when you\'ll have the Denver Broncos and what could be a must-win game. Chargers fans, I\'m sorry.""        Not the best apology, but an apology nonetheless. When the Chargers play the Denver Broncos, they will no doubt be hoping to already be in a Wild Card spot. Such a divisional game is always huge, but the playoff implications will only ramp up the pressure on the young quarterback. Herbert had a phenomenal game against the Dolphins as he completed 39/51 of his throws for 367 yards and a touchdown. Tua Tagovailoa, on the other hand, had one of his worst games of the season. The Dolphins quarterback completed just 10/28 throws for 145 yards and a touchdown. With this win over the Dolphins, Herbert was able to shut down all the comparisons between him and Tua Tagovailoa.

Fantasy outlook and injury update for the Chargers' QB  Several detractors have described Justin Herbert as a social media quarterback, and a few people have even tried to brush off the year-three QB's impact on the Chargers' performances. However, it only takes a little research to discover that the Los Angeles Chargers would be far worse without the Oregon University alum under center.  Herbert has been massive for the Chargers in yet another NFL season, and a postseason appearance is merely a cherry on the top. This was done in an increasingly competitive AFC Conference, where there are some Super Bowl favorites to compete against.         Justin Herbert has stood strong and led the Chargers' quest for some playoff relevance in the 2022 NFL season. It's no surprise then that he will play in tonight's game against the Denver Broncos.           Barring unforeseen circumstances, Herbert will be calling the shots against a wounded Denver Broncos led by perennial Pro Bowler Russell Wilson. Heading into the game, the Chargers are surefire favorites. They are the better team in almost every meaningful statistical category. However, Herbert might only play part of the game, as the Chargers' coaching staff might want to keep him fresh for their likely Wild Card round against a tricky Jacksonville Jaguars team.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Justin Herbert's Fantasy Outlook Justin Herbert came into the league as a solid prospect with a sky-high ceiling and a not-too-low floor. He is blessed with a rocket of an arm, a fantastic football IQ, and the built-in ability to be a starter from day one. As such, it didn't come as a surprise when Herbert started all 15 games of his rookie season, scored 31 touchdowns, and was picked off only ten times. Since then, Herbert has matured even more; he now trusts his backfield more, in particular Austin Ekeler. All of this has helped the Chargers meet their preseason expectations of making the postseason, and it's up to Herbert and the guys to take them even further. Regarding tonight's game, Herbert is off the injury report against the Russell Wilson-led Denver Broncos. Herbert has shaken off a niggling shoulder injury, and he has been in every practice this week.     However, there is a chance that the Chargers will rest Herbert for most of the game to keep him fresh. They have all but secured their playoff berth.  But if seeding becomes an issue, then expect Herbert to take the bulk of the offensive snaps. Footballism@FootbaIIismNever Forget when Justin Herbert threw this ball 62 yards...

Unfortunately, it was too little, too late as the Raiders defeated the Chargers 35-32 in an overtime classic.        The outcome of Sunday night\'s game between the Los Angeles Chargers and the Las Vegas Raiders had playoff implications for three different teams.            The winner of the game also won a trip to the playoffs and would guarantee the Pittsburgh Steelers a trip to the playoffs as well.  If the Chargers and Raiders tied, then both would get into the playoffs and the Steelers would be out.

The team at the bottom of everyone\'s NFL power ranking fell to 0-7 with Sunday\'s 18-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills. The Jets are the league\'s only winless team, and the two people taking the most heat for that are head coach Adam Gase and quarterback Sam Darnold.        The No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Darnold has not lived up to expectations by any measure. There are other young QBs who are surrounded by teams with talent deficiencies -- Joe Burrow (Bengals), Justin Herbert (Chargers) and Daniel Jones (Giants) come to mind -- but they\'re doing better individually than Darnold.           On Sunday, Darnold completed 12 of 23 passes for 120 yards, with no touchdowns and two interceptions.

Gase added, ""If you look at it statistically, we\'re not good anywhere statistically."" Can the Jets continue with Adam Gase and Sam Darnold? Some of the blame for that has to go to Gase. He\'s the one who played a big hand in the Jets getting rid of All-Pro running back Le\'Veon Bell a couple weeks ago. Bell was signed by the Jets last year and made the highest-paid running back in the NFL. But Gase reportedly never wanted Bell on the team and couldn\'t figure out how to best use the talented runner.

If they are bad enough to land the No. 1 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, no one would be surprised if they use that pick on another quarterback -- probably Clemson\'s Trevor Lawrence -- and put the Darnold era behind them.     Before that, these Jets just need to get a win (or two).This week doesn\'t look good for that, as they face the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs on the road.After that, however, the Jets have three straight winnable games against the New England Patriots, Los Angeles Chargers and Miami Dolphins.

Receiver Tyreek Hill was again the Dolphins\' main threat as he caught four passes for 81 yards and a touchdown along with a fumble return for a touchdown. Other than that it was slim pickings for Miami.

The Chargers are an enigma. They can turn up and thrash any team in the league, but they can also drop a dud performance in a game they are expected to dominate. Quarterback Justin Herbert is maturing into a good signal-caller, but some erratic throws are holding him back from punching into the upper echelon of quarterbacks in the NFL.        This season, the Vikings have been a massive disappointment and are currently far off the pace from a playoff spot. Their offense has shown flashes of greatness in some games but has fizzled out in others. The defense, much like the Chargers', isn't much to speak about. Head coach Mike Zimmer is in the hot seat. If results don't improve soon, he'll have to update his CV and lineup for interviews in the offseason.

Brady\'s ongoing antics, at two decades and (potentially) counting, should probably assure the football world that there is no ""next"" Brady; but perhaps those that have the potential to work past his historic accomplishments, even if they aren\'t ""burdened"" with them, are already among us.        SK has five names to keep an eye on when it comes to that endeavor.           Which current NFL quarterbacks have the best chance of surpassing Brady\'s on-field legend? Allen has appeared to have picked up where Brady left off in the AFC East (Photo: Getty) Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills It would only make sense that the conqueror of Brady\'s AFC East empire ‚Äî even if the arguable GOAT wasn\'t there to defend it ‚Äî picked up where he left off in terms of on-field greatness.      Allen\'s ability to multi-task both through the air and on the ground for the Buffalo Bills makes him one of the game\'s most electrifying modern playmakers and a reliable prescience at the end of the game.  When the 2021 season began, many pegged the Bills and the Buccaneers to meet in a Super Bowl that could possibly serve as a change-of-the-guard. Allen\'s late-season showings, particularly in a late-season win over the Patriots, have kept this possibility healthy. Burrow put on one of the most amazing performances of the NFL\'s Week 16 proceedings (Photo: Getty)     Joe Burrow, Cincinnati Bengals Part of Brady\'s allure is that he was able to take one of the NFL\'s more downtrodden franchises, the aforementioned Patriots, and turned them into a gridiron dynasty so revered and feared that it causes audible groans from the NFL public when they win.  Burrow is in a similar situation with the Cincinnati Bengals, a team that hasn\'t won a mere playoff game, much less gone to a Super Bowl since the 1990-91 season. To put things in perspective, even the lowly Detroit Lions have advanced to a postseason round in that span. Burrow\'s hyped NFL career got off to a slow start thanks to a devastating knee injury that ended his rookie year prematurely; but he has returned with a vengeance in 2021, turning the Bengals into playoff contenders after they won only six games over the last two years. He may only be heating up as he closes in on his first NFL postseason experience, tossing for 525 yards in Cincinnati\'s crucial Sunday win over the Baltimore Ravens.

Herbert has been more than happy to give people what they want with one of the strongest young arms in recent memory. Herbert, a first-round pick out of Oregon, was ushered into NFL stardom thanks to an injury to presumed starter Tyrod Taylor. That, however, is where the similarities between him and Brady end.      The Oregon alum was expected to fulfill great expectations right from the get-go, setting numerous rookie records last year. As the owner of the most such tallies over his first two seasons (72 touchdown passes, 8,730 yards, both counting), he\'s the most likely young candidate at the moment to break some of Brady\'s most hallowed NFL marks. These NFL veterans still have time to track Brady down Jackson has been one of the NFL\'s most electrifying playmakers since entering the league (Photo: Getty) Lamar Jackson, Baltimore     If Brady\'s been known to do one thing, it\'s silencing his doubters. The multi-talented Jackson, beset by another injury in recent times, has built a sizable base of detractors but has been downright historic in his quest to rewrite the joint passing/rushing chapters of the NFL record book.  Jackson\'s durability may wind up costing him a spot among the all-time greats, but he undoubtedly has the talent. The fact that he has managed to become a more sustainable version of Michael Vick ‚Äî namely through fulfilling the traditional duties of a quarterback with better consistency ‚Äî bodes well for his young, developing NFL legacy; and that type of popularity could help outlast Brady should his production continue at this pace. Mahomes meets Brady in December 2019 (Photo: Getty)     Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Had to save the most obvious for last, no?  Mahomes is in the midst of only his fourth year as the Chiefs\' primary thrower, but he\'d probably be a lock for Canton if he decided to strike fear in the hearts of red-clad fans everywhere and he retired tomorrow.  The one thing that could be preventing Mahomes from taking over the Brady throne is his lack of a championship title earned against the reigning Super Bowl MVP. He had his opportunity to swipe the keys of the NFL away from Brady in last year\'s Big Game, but he fell short. Capitalizing on a potential rematch would be huge for Mahomes\' fledgling legacy.

But the performance of Eagles quarterback Hurts was something to behold, as aside from his costly fumble, Hurts was faultless on the biggest stage.

Jalen Hurts and Eagles looking to go one better in 2023 Super Bowl LVII - Kansas City Chiefs v Philadelphia Eagles     Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles had a superb 2022 season and came extremely close to winning the Super Bowl earlier this year. But after such a close loss, one of two things usually happens to teams.    They either use it as motivation and get back to the big game or it takes a mental toll, and the following season is poor. It will be interesting to see which way it goes for the Eagles. The road back isn\'t exactly going to be easy. After losing a host of defensive starters plus their two coordinators, the Eagles and Jalen Hurts will have a tougher time next season.        Add in that the Dallas Cowboys have improved, so have Seattle, and then there are the San Francisco 49ers. So the Eagles ""should"" be making it to the playoffs, and once there, they can use last season\'s loss to push them to greater heights.The long road back to the Super Bowl starts at training camp in a few weeks, and the Eagles, along with Jalen Hurts, have their eyes focused squarely on winning that Super Bowl.     ', 'Colin Cowherd details why Jalen Hurts\' Eagles might fall off a cliff next season - ""Blinking red lights""  If you are a Philadelphia Eagles and Jalen Hurts fan, Colin Cowherd has some bad news for you. Every year before the NFL season begins, fans determine their favorites for the upcoming season. More often than not, it is based on last season\'s performances.  However, as we all know, there are always new faces that come into the playoffs every year and a team that did well the previous season falls out. Among new teams, one could be looking at the New York Jets this season with Aaron Rodgers. But looking at teams that may fade away, Colin Cowherd picked the Philadelphia Eagles.        He began by saying:           ‚ÄòWe went back this morning. And we always know that every year there are seven new playoff teams and anytime you suggest a team that made it last year won\'t this year, people freak out. But there\'ll be seven new playoff teams."" Colin Cowherd continued by saying that there might be a drop in Jalen Hurts performance due to the injury sustained last year. He also claimed the offensive line, which was the best last season, might drop in intensity given their age. He added: ""So now we have to tell you a team that we think is really good, but there are some blinking red lights. So, remember Philadelphia\'s Jalen Hurts, second year starting last year, runs more per game than any quarterback since Lamar Jackson. Got hurt. A little wide receiver drama AJ brown. Leading rusher is gone. Offensive line is really, really old.""     Colin Cowherd highlights two other reasons beyond Jalen Hurts why the Philadelphia Eagles might struggle Colin Cowherd also noted the play-caller last year was Shane Steichen, who is now with the Indianapolis Colts. They have also lost Jonathan Gannon, their defensive coordinator to the Arizona Cardinals. ""And the other thing is Nick Sirianni gave up play calling and then they got really good. Uh oh, they lost both coordinators including the play caller Shane Steichen who\'s now coach for the Colts.""

And by the way from October 8 to December 17. At Matt Stafford, at Aaron Rodgers.

', ""Why was Jalen Hurts not a first-round pick?  Jalen Hurts was selected in the second round of the 2020 draft. The Philadelphia Eagles drafted the quarterback as the 53rd overall pick as a potential long-term replacement for Carson Wentz. The selection has turned out to be an astute draft pick for the franchise.  It's surprising, however, that a quarterback who has played for two of the most prominent college football programs waited that long to be selected. Hurt had a pretty successful college career. Why then was he not considered by a number of teams in the league?        Philadelphia Eagles@EaglesWith the 53rd pick in the 2020 #NFLDraft, the #Eagles select QB Jalen Hurts.#EaglesDraft | #FlyEaglesFly138223807           Jalen Hurts College Football Career Beginning his collegiate career at Alabama, Jalen Hurts made history as the first freshman to start at quarterback for the Crimson Tide, displacing Blake Barnett in the starting role. During his tenure, he won 26 games and recorded 71 total touchdowns. Hurts‚Äô career at Alabama took a downturn after he was replaced by Tua Tagovailua at halftime of the national championship game. Tagovailua came in and led the team from behind to a victory in overtime. That secured him a starting berth for the following season.     After playing second fiddle to Tagovailoa in his junior year, Hurts transferred to Oklahoma for his senior year in college. Jalen Hurts had a commendable performance with the Sooners. He recorded 32 passing touchdowns and 20 rushing touchdowns. Nonetheless, that was not enough to earn a favorable draft evaluation among NFL teams. Why Hurts wasn't Selected in the First Round College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl - LSU v Oklahoma Jalen Hurts was the fifth quarterback selected in the 2020 draft, behind Joe Burrow, Tua Tagovailoa, Justin Herbert, and Jordan Love. He has, however, outperformed most of them in the NFL despite not being as highly rated initially as they were.     Most NFL teams were skeptical of Hurts' ability. It is believed that the offensive system of head coach Lincoln Riley of the Oklahoma Sooners was particularly accommodating to quarterbacks, causing doubts about Hurts‚Äô capability as a pocket passer. He was noted for not having an especially powerful throwing arm, which was considered a big flaw. He was also thought to have the propensity to be a quarterback who focused on only one potential target during pass plays, according to the scouts.

He explained to host Reggie Roberts how Jalen Hurts showcased the traits of an elite NFL quarterback in the Philadelphia Eagles\' narrow win over the Colts. Here\'s what he said: ""The great quarterbacks in this league are going to be able to find a way to win when things aren\'t always going the way that you want them to go.

By the way, they\'re still in the playoff hunt. Right? They\'ve revived their season here in the last two weeks. But he found a way to get it done.""     He also complimented Jalen Hurts\' performance as a passer against the Colts: ""He had to throw the football. He\'s been running it all season long.

And even though he only had six or seven incompletions and they might have ugly incompletions, but still he was fairly accurate throwing the football.""

', ""Eagles make Ravens' Lamar Jackson treatment look worse with Jalen Hurts' $255 million extension  Jalen Hurts just signed a massive contract extension with the Philadelphia Eagles. The star quarterback signed a five-year extension worth $255 million. This makes him the highest-paid player in NFL history with a $51 million salary. No other player has ever had more.  While Hurts' contract is going to have ripple effects on the entire league and perhaps the sport in general, it is making one team look a lot worse: the Baltimore Ravens.                     The Ravens have refused to sign their own star quarterback to a lengthy contract. They were unable to come to terms last offseason and now Lamar Jackson is a free agent with zero intention of playing with the Ravens anymore. The Eagles avoided all of this by signing Hurts earlier. They also avoided any drama by offering him what he's worth, perhaps even more than that. Hurts isn't the best player in NFL history, but the Eagles knew what they had to do to keep one of the most important quarterbacks in the league.        Though it's too late, the Ravens could learn a thing or two from them. Had they gone this route, it might have been easier and cheaper for them. Now, they might lose Jackson and be forced to start over.  Jalen Hurts' signing makes the Lamar Jackson saga even more confusing Jalen Hurts is an excellent player. He is a dynamic rusher and one of the league's best passers. However, there's an argument that he's not better than Lamar Jackson.     The Ravens quarterback won MVP in 2019. Hurts is coming off an MVP runner-up season, but winning the award is certainly better than coming in second. Hurts also went to the Super Bowl, something Jackson hasn't done. However, that's a team accolade. The Eagles made the Super Bowl, not just Hurts. They did so by forming one of the league's most well-rounded teams, something that will now be more difficult, admittedly. NFL fans and pundits can argue Jalen Hurts vs. Lamar Jackson all day long and go either way, but the simple fact of the matter is that the Eagles did what the Ravens should have. The Jalen Hurts extension makes Lamar Jackson's situation worse     They signed their star player and rewarded him for his growth and performance. The Ravens had no intention of doing that and it's going to cost them.Not only is Jackson possibly gone, but this entire saga will be remembered by potential free agents in the future. The Ravens now look like a bad franchise that free agents shouldn't play for.     "", ""Jalen Hurts and the modern dual-threat QB  Jalen Hurts has been an offensive nightmare all season. Hurts creates a mismatch advantage for the Philadelphia Eagles offense as they carry an extra runner in the backfield that has the potential to dart past the line of scrimmage like a star running back for a huge gain or complete a gunslinger-type pass down the field.   For a franchise getting, the QB right changes the entire atmosphere of the organization. The Eagles have joined other franchises, such as the Buffalo Bills and the Baltimore Ravens who are taking advantage of the current dual-threat talent boom to turn into contenders.        Jalen Hurts and the Eagles playmaker-rich offense           Philadelphia Eagles v Chicago Bears Second-year head coach Nick Sirianni has constructed an offense that punishes defenses in multiple ways through the pass and ground game. Their offensive line excels at both run and pass blocking. The Eagles offense makes plays scripted and unscripted at high levels due to the amount of playmakers loading the offensive side.  Jalen Hurts and running back Miles Sanders provide a power run game that sets up a possession-based passing game. Through this, the Eagles dominate the short and intermediate zones with their running threat and elite contested catch receivers. Hurts has made tremendous leaps in the consistency of his passing game and now, in a traditional game manager fashion, routinely spreads it around to the multiple playmakers on offense.     Jalen Hurts vs. the Green Bay Packers: The modern dual-threat performance Fran Duffy@EaglesXOsJalen Hurts diced up the #Packers on Sunday on third down and always seemed one step ahead with his arm and his legs. A few of my favorite reps from the #FlyEaglesFly offense in this game..871116 Passing Yards: 153 Pass Att: 28 Pass Cmp%: 57.14% Rush Yards:157 Carries: 17 Att Yards Per Carry: 9.24 Int: 0 Fumble: 1 The Eagles played the game with two running threats the Packers couldn‚Äôt contain. This offensive mismatch with Jalen Hurts as the second disguised runner helped the offensive line, who run block really well for a creative run game. While the defense was struggling to stop the run threat, Hurts was spreading the ball over the top to playmakers DaVonta Smith, A.J. Brown and Quez Watkins.      The Packers defense tried putting pressure on Hurts, but the line held up well. Even when the Packers were able to get pressure on Hurts, he just darted out of the pocket for multiple gains and passes off script. As a former Alabama QB under Nick Saban, Hurts understands how costly turnovers can be and rarely throws interceptable passes. The worst offenses look clunky and have no consistency in how they make plays as they bring the ball up the field. The Eagles made use of fake runs from both Sanders/Gainwell to set up Hurts rush/pass attempts in a very fluid and routine way that the Packers defense struggled with all night. There is an old saying that goes ‚ÄúOne can not serve two masters at once‚Äù. The Packers defense had one eye on the run game and one on the pass and failed to get a hand on either all night. Nick Sirriani and OC Shane Steichen use this misdirection to buy receivers extra time and space to make plays.     Green Bay Packers v Philadelphia Eagles On the opposite end of this offensive masterclass was Aaron Rodgers putting up what would have been the ideal performance of a traditional pocket passer QB making several tough throws despite immense pressure from the Eagles defensive line. Rodgers' limitations in this game show how the position has changed over the years. When the pass was not there, Rodgers was a sitting duck for the Eagles pass rush struggling to escape pressure or make plays with his legs. The Eagles have what seems like a permanent run threat while the Packers run game is non-existent if Rodgers is forced to rush.     TheJalen Hurts' existing limiations and the modern dual-threat QB Philadelphia Eagles v Chicago Bears Hurts development as a passer is tied to the Eagles' investment in playmakers, offensive coaches and a safe passing scheme. Hurts does not put the ball in danger and rarely takes chance throws down the field. This leads to their passing game not being as threatening as their running game. It‚Äôs become really common to see Hurts run in a touchdown in the endzone. While this powerback skill is appreciated and endears him to the offensive line, it masks Jalen Hurts' weakness to make tight window throws. The end zone requires risky passes Jalen Hurts will not throw in fear of interceptions. If a team is capable of stopping the Eagles dominant run game and forcing Hurts outside his routine comfort throws to force turnovers, the Eagles offense could be stopped. This will be a difficult task for any defense, but it may be the only way to stop such an explosive/creative offense. Dual threat QBs will always lack the extra polish pocket passers have to their throws. Their footwork will be off. They will run too early on some plays, giving up on the pass and missing throws they should make. This is all payoff for the permanent run threat they provide the offense. Jalen Hurts will never be the silky passer that Patrick Mahomes is, but that does not stop the Eagles offense from being just as explosive.

""And part of that is our defenses create a lot of turnovers. But the biggest part of that is that we have taken care of the football. Yeah, we\'ve said this before, and I think that this is a vastly underrated part of Jalen Hurts, his football game right now is that not only is he being a playmaker, but he\'s doing it in a way that is smart.""     He continued: ""He is taking care of the football, he\'s making good decisions, it\'s hard to be aggressive, and to score points, and put up yards the way he has while also doing so by not being prone to making mistakes."" Jason added that he doesn\'t think that many others have done a better job than Hurts this season and that he has to be an MVP candidate: ""And the fact that he\'s doing that and leading our team and not putting us in negative situations. I mean, if that\'s not an MVP candidate, at the top, I don\'t know which one is so now, we\'re only halfway through the season, we got a long season left not even halfway, we got to continue to play at this level.

', ""Why was Jalen Hurts' hail mary pass woefully short? Video shows real reason behind Eagles QB's weak attempt  Jalen Hurts turned in a spectacular performance during Super Bowl LVII. Despite his Philadelphia Eagles being defeated by the Kansas City Chiefs, a case can be made that he was the best player on the field during the game.  He recorded four total touchdowns in an incredible losing effort. Hurts statistically outplayed even Patrick Mahomes, who was named the Super Bowl MVP.        Philadelphia let a 10-point halftime lead slip away during the second half, allowing the Chiefs to complete an epic comeback victory. Following the Chiefs' final drive of the game, the Eagles took over with just seconds remaining on the clock and trailing by three. Philadelphia didn't have enough time to try to get into field goal range, so they opted for a Hail Mary instead.           On the final play of Super Bowl LVII, Jalen Hurts sent all of his wide receivers far down the field. He loaded up to unleash a Hail Mary, hoping for a miraculous jumpball to fall in the Eagles' favor. The issue was that the football only traveled about 50 yards in the air, while the receivers were set up further downfield. Hurts' pass never had a chance as it fell uncontested.      Jalen Hurts received criticism following the game for his poor attempt at a Hail Mary. His arm strength was called into question and claims were made that he may be incapable of launching such passes downfield. A video surfaced the following morning that attempted to explain why the throw fell as short as it did.

This likely affected the power and trajectory of the throw, causing it to fall woefully short of the endzone.     Did Jalen Hurts cost the Eagles a Super Bowl LVII victory? Jalen Hurts Jalen Hurts made two crucial mistakes during Super Bowl LVII that contributed to the Eagles' loss to the Chiefs. In addition to the failed Hail Mary attempt, he also committed a costly turnover. During the second quarter of the game, Hurts fumbled the football while being tackled, which resulted in a Nick Bolton touchdown recovery. The score tied the game at 14 for the Chiefs.        Despite two major errors, Hurts is far from the reason why the Eagles lost the game. He was excellent for most of it, totaling more than 300 yards and four touchdowns. A more legitimate case could be made that Hurts is the reason why the Eagles weren't blown out despite giving up 38 points.

21,Nick Mullens,"['Are Philadelphia Eagles still unsure about QB Jalen Hurts? Philadelphia trades for Jacksonville QB Gardner Minshew  The Philadelphia Eagles may have made a very underrated roster move by acquiring QB Garnder Minshew from the Jacksonville Jaguars, adding to a roster with Jalen Hurts and Joe Flacco already in place. Gardner Minshew lost a QB ""battle"" that he was never seriously going to win against the number one overall pick Trevor Lawrence. Minshew was a breakout star in 2019 when he took over for Nick Foles. In 2020, he struggled on the field with a lingering hand injury that impacted his performance. The Jaguars drafted Lawrence, a generational talent, and it was just a matter of time before they traded Gardner Minshew as he wasn\'t going to unseat Trevor Lawrence any time soon.  Trade: #Eagles have acquired QB Gardner Minshew from Jacksonville in exchange for a conditional sixth-round pick in 2022. The team also released QB Nick Mullens. pic.twitter.com/MLYrJfymxE‚Äî Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) August 28, 2021        Gardner Minshew trade shows uncertainty with Jalen Hurts...and Jacksonville Jaguars head coach?           Enter the Philadelphia Eagles, who have been in deep thought on what Jalen Hurts\' future holds with the team. Through three NFL preseason games, Jalen Hurts saw action only in Week 1 as the starter (3/7 for 54 yards). QB Joe Flacco played most of the preseason and played well, too. Philadelphia seems to be hinting to Jalen Hurts that his time as a starter could be in jeopardy by offering a sixth-round pick for Gardner Minshew. So yes, the Philadelphia Eagles are still not sold on Jalen Hurts being the face of their franchise. That doesn\'t mean he\'ll be benched immediately for Flacco or Minshew, who is #3 on the depth chart. The team does have options at QB now though, if injury, COVID-19, or regression strikes Jalen Hurts. Flacco had a great preseason and showed he can still perform with success in the NFL, but he\'s not suited to lead Nick Sirianni\'s offense. It requires a smaller, more mobile and athletic player and that has never been Joe Flacco. Gardner Minshew, on the other hand, looks like a prime candidate for such a system. The Eagles do not know if he\'ll be more like the 2019 or 2020 Gardner Minshew, though. It would be smart not to give Minshew responsibilities on the offense before he earns them.     Eagles just landed a 25-year old QB that has completed 62.9% with 37 TD, only 11 INT, and 93.1% rating in his first two seasons for a stinking 6th round pick. Gardner Minshew is a winning NFL quarterback. Absolute no-brainer deal for Howie Roseman.‚Äî Jim Nagy (@JimNagy_SB) August 28, 2021 Jacksonville dropped the ball with Gardner Minshew Giving up a sixth-round pick for a QB with 5,530 passing yards and 37 passing TDs in two years is a steal and says more about the dysfunction and uncertainty in Jacksonville than Philadelphia. The so-called QB competition seemed like an act to boost Minshew\'s trade value, which failed obviously and leaves HC Urban Meyer to be criticized for such a move. Still, Philadelphia does well to have extra options at QB, something they\'ve been known to do over the years.     Despite playing 13 less full games, Jalen Hurts had more 300+ passing yard performances than Baker Mayfield.In Hurts‚Äô 3 game stretch of full starts, he also averaged more YPG, TD per game, and had a higher Comp %.#Eagles pic.twitter.com/mpF8OkEpb4‚Äî Eagles Nation (@PHLEaglesNation) August 23, 2021 Jalen Hurts has potential, but needs to utilize it early in 2021 Jalen Hurts is still just 23 with only four career starts, even though it may feel he\'s played more than that. A 1-3 record isn\'t great and neither is a 52% completion rate, 6 TDs, and four INTs. The upside is that he\'s shown he can lead, the offense respects him, and he\'s had 300+ yards in two of his four starts. He\'s played much better in training camp, but he really needed the reps in the preseason regardless of the Eagles wanting to rest him to prevent an injury. Jalen Hurts\' small amount of playing time in his career isn\'t large enough to really allow him to have a long leash as a starter and he will be under the microscope. While Gardner Minshew\'s arrival isn\'t a formal answer to Jalen Hurts losing his starting job, it does prove the Eagles feel they need to have suitable options on the depth chart. Don\'t bet on Philadelphia having a winning season in 2021.     ', ""5 takeaways from the Pittsburgh Steelers' win over the Philadelphia Eagles in preseason  In the first official week of the 2021 NFL preseason, the Philadelphia Eagles went up against the Pittsburgh Steelers, with the Steelers winning their second-straight NFL preseason game 24-16.   We got to see a lot more of OC Matt Canada's new offense in Pittsburgh, though. The Eagles had some success, but have a number of things to work on in training camp before they endure the rigors of the regular season.         Here are a some of the main takeaways from the Pittsburgh Steelers vs Philadelphia Eagles game in Week 1 of the NFL preseason.            Five things we learned from Pittsburgh Steelers vs Philadelphia Eagles  #1 - Preseason MVPs on each team Eagles WR Quez Watkins can flat out FLY üí® üí® üí® pic.twitter.com/8l26sk2Q4y‚Äî Field Yates (@FieldYates) August 13, 2021 Ben Roethlisberger once again sat out for the Pittsburgh Steelers, but Jalen Hurts got in some early reps. The Steelers also played a majority of their starters, outside of a select few.      For the Philadelphia Eagles, the clear MVP of the game was WR Quez Watkins. Right before kickoff, the announcers claimed they were keeping an eye on Watkins for his speed and they weren't wrong. Early in the game, Quez Watkins was able to burn past his defender as Jalen Hurts threw to him running up the sideline. Unfortunately, it was overthrown and out of reach.  Later in the first quarter, Watkins caught a screen pass from QB Joe Flacco and turned on the turbo for a 79-yard TD thanks to a few good blocks. His speed has gained him attention in training camp and it could land him in the starting rotation at this rate.

Dwayne Haskins was a close second with his 161 yards and a TD, including several passes in tight windows. He had some rocky moments as well, though.  Overall, the Pittsburgh Steelers' RBs ran for 160 yards on 37 carries (4.3 yards per carry). Tony Brooks-James was the lead rusher with 51 yards and had several nice gains in the second half. Jaylen Samuels was able to make a case for a roster spot with 45 yards and newly-signed Pete Guerriero had 20 yards.  Najee Harris had a couple nice moments, but had one taken back by a holding call. #2 - Players who might be on the roster bubble  While there were many bright spots in this game, both teams could look at a few players and put them on the shortlist for the roster bubble when it comes time for the first cuts. Nick Mullens throws a pick with his first throw as an Eagle#Eagles #FlyEaglesFly pic.twitter.com/I9cw8H2ael‚Äî Brodes Media (@BrodesMedia) August 13, 2021     For Philadelphia, that player could be QB Nick Mullens. Mullens was primed to have a positive outing in this game and show that he can drive a team downfield with some success. Instead, he looked far from confident on the field. His first INT occurred when he was forced to get the ball out quickly with pressure closing in. He threw it behind his receiver and Justin Layne snagged it.  His second pick was more his own fault. Mullens showed a lack of arm strength and follow-through on a deep pass that was also a late throw. Lafayette Pitts was able to pick it from the air and get a decent return. The Pittsburgh Steelers might also have to take a second look at TE Zach Gentry. He had two targets in the game, but clearly dropped one. Dwayne Haskins' pass was a little behind him but still catchable.  Gentry only had one target in the Hall of Fame Game and Kevin Rader could end up jumping him on the depth chart. He's yet to make an impact as a 2019 fifth-round pick.     #3 - Dwayne Haskins is making strides at QB3, but Josh Dobbs is still in the reckoning for the Pittsburgh Steelers Vintage Dwayne Haskins üòç pic.twitter.com/7NPC1P4vrH‚Äî Barstool OSU (@BarstoolOSU) August 13, 2021 Pittsburgh Steelers QB Josh Dobbs only had 30 passing yards and an INT in this game but had a much better outing in the Hall of Fame Game. He played in the fourth quarter, where the Pittsburgh Steelers were constantly feeding their RBs, who were carving up the sleepy Philadelphia DL.  His first pass was low and his second was picked off after Elijah Riley read his eyes and jumped the route. Several of Dobbs' passes were low and almost out of reach for his targets.     Haskins played well in his role for the Pittsburgh Steelers, but it was far from perfect. He threaded the needle on several key throws, but had some that were off-target and wobbly. The biggest takeaway was the mental mistakes he made, such as running the wrong way on a read-option play.  Haskins will likely still start over Dobbs in the next game for the Pittsburgh Steelers, but Dobbs could get back in the game with a strong showing. #4 - Philadelphia DL was sluggish and ineffective for most of the second half The Eagles pulled most of their starters in the second half, but left some second-string players in. DC Jonathan Gannon should have made some personnel changes in the third quarter, as his defensive line was pounded on and slowed as the quarter went on.  The Pittsburgh Steelers possessed the ball for the majority of the third quarter, thanks to their success running the ball up the middle. Seventh-round LB Patrick Johnson was a highlight on the edge and was one of the few players able to apply any real pressure on the QB.     #5 - Special teams were strong on both sides 50 yard FG nailed & that's now 3/3 for Jake Elliott#Eagles #FlyEaglesFly pic.twitter.com/hIu3eUc36k‚Äî Brodes Media (@BrodesMedia) August 13, 2021 In the Hall of Fame Game, Pittsburgh Steelers rookie punter Pressley Harvin lll had an amazing performance with two punts inside the 10 and another deep one. He seemed to have the punter battle in his pocket, but then Jordan Berry showed up.  His first punt was recovered at the two-yard line and his second bounced back, similar to Harvin's a week earlier, and was downed inside the 10. His longest of the night was 54 yards. Pittsburgh Steelers kicker Chris Boswell made his only XP attempt while Sam Sloman played a bit better than the Hall of Fame Game, where he missed a FG and XP.Quez Watkins had a decent return on the opening kickoff and Jason Huntley had one at 35 yards. Punter Arryn Siposs was kicking bombs all night, averaging 50.8 yards on four punts and his longest was 55 yards. Kicker Jake Elliott nailed two 47-yard and a 50-yard kicks with ease right down the middle.     "", 'Fantasy Football: Sleeper picks at RB for Week 15  If, like me, you began this fantasy football season with the goal of an imaginary Lombardi Trophy firmly fixed on the radar -- what with having drafted Christian McCaffrey (4th) and Joe Mixon (20th) -- but now find yourself trailing in the first of your two-legged semifinals after having to start Ty Johnson and DeAndre Washington at RB last week (I\'m in a deep and unforgiving league), then this is the article for you.  Let\'s cast an eye over five sleeper picks at running back who just might be available as we head into Week 15.                   5. Austin Ekeler (Los Angeles Chargers) Carolina Panthers v Los Angeles Chargers Your writer participates in 25 fantasy leagues, and believe it or not, having been injured for most of the season, Chargers RB Austin Ekeler was a free agent in around a quarter of those leagues at this time last week. (""Was"" being the operative word: I signed Ekeler multiple times last week.) Since returning from injury in Week 12, the Chargers\' No. 1 back has averaged about 19 fantasy points per game, putting him alongside the likes of Derrick Henry and Alvin Kamara for fantasy output.     Ekeler is now rostered in 98 percent of fantasy leagues, but if you\'re competing in a league with a bunch of slackers and bots, it\'s worth taking a quick look in free agency to see if he\'s still kicking about.  4. Cam Akers (Los Angeles Rams)  New England Patriots v Los Angeles Rams The Rams\' running game has been unpredictable this year: they\'ve had stints with Malcolm Brown featured in the backfield, and Darrel Henderson Jr. has had a fair chance at the spotlight, too ... but mostly without much of an impact from either.     In Week 9, following a difficult start to the campaign, fit-again rookie Cam Akers was reinstated to the first team and hasn\'t really looked back since. In his last 4 games, the Florida State product has averaged at about 15 fantasy points per game, yet is still only a registered asset in 85 percent of leagues across ESPN. Congratulations @thereal_cam3 on your very first NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors! üëèüì∞ ¬ª https://t.co/qmgd0A9H1L pic.twitter.com/8NJiT0eQYh‚Äî Los Angeles Rams (@RamsNFL) December 16, 2020 Akers is the reigning AFC Offensive Player of the Week hearing into Week 15, so it\'s well worth taking a peak to see if he is still available in your free agency pool; especially with the dreadful New York Jets up next against the Rams -- easy money, baby!      3. JK Dobbins (Baltimore Ravens)  Dallas Cowboys v Baltimore Ravens Dobbins had been an inconsistent performer for the Ravens early this season. Often neglected of responsibilities in the RedZone and rarely chalking up +75-yards rushing, the rookie eventually fell foul of fantasy managers and is now registered in just 75 percent of leagues. Dobbins\'s recent form has been remarkably improved. In fact, since finally breaking +100-yards rushing against the Steelers during a big performance in week-8, the Ohio State product has averaged 11.5 fantasy points per game and now offers real flex value in deeper leagues.     Is Dobbins kicking it in your free agency pile? Again, well worth a look.  4. J.D McKissic (Washington Football Team) Washington Football Team v San Francisco 49ers Registered in just 80 percent of fantasy leagues, Washington back, J.D. McKissic is another player who presents flex/RB2 value heading into Week 15. Washington will face the Seattle Seahawks without the services of Antonio Gibson on Sunday, meaning McKissic is likely to see more of the football. Pete Carroll\'s team is ranked 4th in the NFL when it comes to stopping the run but have put up below par numbers in coverage. McKissic is more of a catch-first back anyway, so this could be a good game for him to pad his stats.      1. Jeff Wilson Jr. (San Francisco 49ers) San Francisco 49ers v New England Patriots With Jerick McKinnon seemingly having fallen out of favor in coach Kyle Shanahan\'s offense, and with starting RB Raheem Mostert (hip) yet again dealing with injury concerns, Jeff Wilson Jr presents some true flex value for fantasy managers this weekend. The former UNT star will likely be boosted up to an RB1 slot if Mostert misses out. Up against a lackluster Cowboys\' D, this could be a big fantasy outing for San Francisco\'s No. 30, especially given the irregularity QB Nick Mullens has thrown the dingus with in recent games: all things considered, I\'d be surprised if the 49ers didn\'t look to pound the ball up the middle, which means the potential for a big score from Wilson.Jeff Wilson puts the 49ers up 7-0 pic.twitter.com/qVtYTrVU9n‚Äî ESPN 1320 Sacramento (@ESPN1320) December 13, 2020     ', 'NFL trade deadline predictions: 3 bold moves the Browns could make  The Cleveland Browns are standing on a cliff\'s edge. In under two weeks, the team could be 3-5 and without a starting quarterback. At a certain point, the writing is on the wall and the team needs to make some decisions about the future. If Mayfield is still hurt or the team simply isn\'t winning, it might make sense to trade away some players to get ready for next season.  At the same time, if the team is instead 5-3 and still alive, they could also be inclined to make some last-minute moves to bolster the roster before the trade deadline becomes official on Tuesday, November 2. Either way, the Browns could be in for an explosive start to November. Here\'s a look at two players the Browns could trade away and one they could add.        NFL trade deadline 2021: Browns building or Browns auctioning?           #1 - Browns trade away Odell Beckham Jr. The Browns may trade Odell Beckham Jr. away if they don\'t round a corner in the next ten days. Beckham has been injury-prone and is about to turn 30 years old. Next season, the Browns will be on the hook for about $15 million, according to Spotrac. Would it be worth keeping him around at that price?

After the season, teams will not be in the heat of the moment and will not be interested in trading more than the least amount possible. In the middle of the season, desperation trumps frugality. Barring a miracle, this will be the second season in a row in which Beckham has not reached 1000-yards. At some point, the writing is on the wall and moves need to be made. It seems that it may not be a matter of ""if,"" but a matter of ""when."" Kimberley A. Martin@ByKimberleyAGreetings from @FEStadium! #Browns injury updates: ‚ñ™Ô∏èJarvis Landry was activated off IR‚ñ™Ô∏èOdell Beckham, Jr. (shoulder) will try to see if he can play ‚ñ™Ô∏èLT Jedrick Wills (ankle) is expected to play, but RT Jack Conklin (knee) is not #DENvsCLE10:38 AM ¬∑ Oct 21, 202161     #2 - Browns trade away Case Keenum If Case Keenum does well on Thursday Night Football and Baker Mayfield returns healthy for Week 8, it might make sense for the Browns to cash in. Keenum\'s stock will be at a high and the Browns have Nick Mullens on the roster as well. If the Browns could trade Keenum for one more star, it could be the final piece.     Put simply, with all of the injuries on the roster at the moment, trading Keenum for a star could be the Browns\' biggest move they can make to attempt to stem the tide. It would be a fight back against the injury bug that has currently infested the team.     #3 - Browns trade for DeVante Parker With so much instability out wide for the 2021 Cleveland Browns, adding another face could be a much-needed dose of medicine. DeVante Parker could be just what the doctor ordered. The Dolphins are 1-5 and just gave up a win against the Jacksonville Jaguars. It cannot be any more obvious that their season is over. Thus, they should be evaluating all of their assets, including DeVante Parker. Parker played with Jarvis Landry in Miami. Having a reunion in Cleveland could do wonders for morale out wide and it could help get Parker up to speed quickly. Parker is still playing well enough to be a big help for the Browns. Last week, he had four catches for 77 yards and a touchdown. Of course, after such a performance so recently, Parker wouldn\'t be the cheapest move. Miami Dolphins Training Camp In this scenario, however, the Browns are 4-4 or better and still in the wild-card chase. They could feel that they need some extra juice and are just one player away from making the playoffs for the second year in a row. This would also be the first time since the 1980s. Parker could be that player for the team.     ', 'What is Aaron Rodgers‚Äô record after a loss since Matt LaFleur became Green Bay Packers head coach?

Green Bay\'s defense forced three interceptions from Dak Prescott and Rodgers built up a 31-3 lead midway through the third quarter.     The Dallas Cowboys added points in garbage time, but this was a dominant response from the Packers, with Aaron Rodgers in the game-manager role, throwing for just 238 yards, completing 22 of 34 passes. Aaron Jones ran for four touchdowns in the win. #2 ‚Äì Vs. Carolina Panthers, Week 10, 2019 - W 24-16 Aaron Rodgers recorded only 161 yards and a touchdown in a 26-11 defeat against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 9 but returned in Week 10 to guide Green Bay to a close-fought win against the Kyle Allen-led Carolina Panthers. Another trio of touchdowns from Aaron Jones helped the Packers open a 21-10 lead by the end of the third quarter. Rodgers and his offense ran down the clock, and he finished with 17 completions of 29 attempts for 233 yards. #3 ‚Äì At New York Giants, Week 13 ‚Äì 2019, W 31-13 The Packers fell to 8-3 following a 37-8 blowout loss to the San Francisco 49ers in Week 12 and had to pick themselves up for a trip to New York. Green Bay again controlled the game throughout, going 17-10 up at half-time and adding another 14 points in the fourth quarter.     Aaron Rodgers passed for four touchdowns, with Davante Adams hauling in a couple.

The Packers were up 21-0 at half-time and led 28-7 at the end of the third quarter. Aaron Rodgers clocked 283 yards and four touchdowns, landing 23 of 34 passes. #5 ‚Äì At San Francisco 49ers, Week 9, 2020 - W 34-17 The Packers fell 28-22 against bitter rivals, the Minnesota Vikings, at Lambeau Field in Week 8 and came roaring back to exact revenge on the San Francisco 49ers for their blowout loss the year prior. Marquez Valdez-Scantling notched a pair of touchdowns at Levi\'s Stadium as Rodgers delivered a masterful performance, completing 25 of 31 pass attempts for 305 yards and four touchdowns. With the Niners 31-3 down at the end of the third quarter, quarterback Nick Mullens padded his stat line with a late pair of touchdowns. #6 ‚Äì Vs. Chicago Bears, Week 12, 2020 - W 41-24 A 34-31 overtime loss against the Indianapolis Colts made it three defeats in six games for the Packers.

Aaron Rodgers and the Packers\' offense helped build a 27-3 first-half lead, with the quarterback completing 21 of his 29 pass attempts for 211 yards and four touchdowns to four different receivers. The perfect response Rodgers has a 6-0 record after a loss since Matt LaFleur was appointed head coach, throwing 16 touchdowns and zero interceptions. In every one of these games, the Packers came out fast, surged to a big lead and controlled the clock to win the game. Can they do the same against the Lions in Week 2? We will find out on Sunday.

The Packers are 11-3 and atop the NFC but the Dallas Cowboys, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Los Angeles Rams are each a game behind at 10-4.        Meanwhile, the Cleveland Browns\' loss on Tuesday to the Las Vegas Raiders places them in a precarious position in the AFC North division, where each team has either seven or eight victories and the Browns are currently in last place.

Of course, the nod to a gold jacket is a reference to the color of the jacket that NFL Hall of Fame players are given to wear at the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies. This is the highest praise one NFL player can give to another, and it is obvious that Rodgers has genuine respect for Garrett\'s level of play since he has been in the NFL.

Divisional Round - Cleveland Browns v Kansas City Chiefs The answer to this question begins with the health of the team. In Monday\'s loss to the Raiders, the Browns were without 22 players due to them being placed on the injured reserve/COVID-19 list due to testing positive. Starting quarterback Baker Mayfield, as well as backup quarterback Case Keenum, were two of those on the list and the team went into the game with third-string quarterback Nick Mullens as the starter.     For the Browns to pull off an upset victory over the Packers, the health of their players is imperative. The team will also need a lights-out performance from Myles Garrett.The 6\'4"" 272 pounder has 15 sacks this season, which is currently third in the league.

But this season has certainly brought many surprises, especially on the defensive side of the ball. Certain teams have come up as top-notch defenses, including teams that ""experts"" didn\'t believe would be good at all. Other defenses have regressed and seen better days.        Nonetheless, here are the top 5 defense in the league currently.            5. Washington Football Team Washington Football Team v Dallas Cowboys Yes, the team without a name makes it to this list. Washington has been one of the most consistent and underrated defenses this year, ranking in the top-10 since the season began. But their performance over the past several weeks has awarded the number 5 spot and it\'s simple, Washington\'s young defensive line has proven to be lethal and something of which opposing teams have taken note.     With the likes of rookie Chase Young, Montez Sweat, Daron Payne, and Jonathan Allen, defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio will have plenty of fun terrorizing offenses. Washington is currently allowing 309.5 yards on average to opposing teams, which is the 4th least in the league.  4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Kansas City Chiefs v Tampa Bay Buccaneers Tampa Bay has proven to have a top-5 offense and defense, considering them as Superbowl favorites from the start because of this. Veterans Jason Pierre-Paul and Ndamukong Suh still have plenty of fuel left in their tank, allowing just 74.2 rushing yard per game, the least by any team in the league currently.     Despite allowing 269 receiving yards to Tyreek Hill, the Bucs secondary is still one of the best with some underrated backs. If defensive coordinator Todd Bowles can fix the issues in the secondary, it would be hard to imagine why the Bucs cannot make it further into the playoffs.  3. Indianapolis Colts Green Bay Packers v Indianapolis Colts The Colts\' success is mostly thanks to the defense, who has carried this team, only to be shutdown due to the lack of performance by Philip Rivers and the offense.     Their last game against the Tennessee Titans, in which the Colts lost 45-26, certainly doesn\'t help their case, but current must be given to the linebacker and secondary. Veteran cornerback Xavier Rhodes and linebacker Justin Houston have been the spark in which the Colts heavily needed, with young guys like DeForest Buckner and Darius Leonard on the team. They may not be able to survive in the playoffs for long, but it certainly shows a bright future for this team.  2. Pittsburgh Steelers They may be 11-0, but they aren\'t exactly the best defense in the league.      While the Pittsburgh Steelers are ranked number two on this list, it is important to note what sort of teams the Steelers have faced so far. The Steelers have played only 3 teams that have a .500 or higher record currently, which says a lot about their schedule and the truth behind this team. But nonetheless, the defensive line is on par with Washington\'s defensive line, but the secondary still has its kinks. Just this past week, the Steelers lost linebacker Bud Dupree, who was a major contributor to the defense. They have shown to be a scary defense and have shown flashes of the ""Legion of Boom,"" which was considered one of the best defenses of the decade.  1. Los Angeles Rams This shouldn\'t be a question mark, but the Los Angeles Rams have the most complete defense this season and that is what has given the Rams their wins this season.      With the likes of Jalen Ramsey, Troy Hill, Jordan Fuller, Leonard Floyd, Aaron Donald, and many more, the Rams have shown to be a truly lethal defense. They are allowing just 206.5 passing yards and 93.2 rushing yards to opposing teams, it and shows. In Week 12, they allowed zero passing touchdowns by 49ers quarterback Nick Mullens, had one interception on him, and allowed just one rushing touchdown despite their loss.The defense is certainly set for a few more seasons, but they shouldn\'t rely on it to reach further into the postseason.

Wilson replied: ‚ÄúNo. Are you serious?"" In the 2017-2018 season, quarterbacks Josh McCown and Bryce Petty threw for a combined 60 yards versus the Denver Broncos in Week 14. All-time, the team has thrown for under 100 yards in 55 games.  Should Joe Flacco become the Jets starter for the rest of the season? While head coach Robert Saleh seems to be sticking with Zach Wilson, the numbers show that the team has played better under Joe Flacco. The former Baltimore Ravens star has started three games this season in place of Wilson. In those three games, Flacco threw for a combined 901 yards, five touchdowns and three interceptions. So far, Wilson has 1,279 yards, four touchdowns, and five interceptions. Joe Flacco also has a lot more experience starting games in this league with 179 career starts and 163 with the Ravens in 11 seasons.      When Jets rookie wide receiver Garrett Wilson was asked how bad the offense was in Week 11, he didn\'t hold back. Garrett Wilson said: ""This sh*t is not okay. Straight up, it is not okay,\'\' the first-round pick said. ""How many total yards did we have (103)? That shit is not going to fly. We got the dudes. It\'s time to be consistent. It\'s time to win the games we should win."" Wilson has thrown for under 200 yards passing in a game this season four times, including the loss versus the Patriots. He also hasn\'t thrown a touchdown in four of his last five starts, which was the case against the Patriots. In Week Nine against the Jets, the former BYU star had his lone game with a passer rating of over 100 (101.8 versus the Buffalo Bills).        The New York Jets are still in the playoff hunt with a 6 - 4 record this season and in third place in the AFC East. Will Salah replace Zach WIlson with Joe Flacco if Wilson continues to struggle?        The Jets drafted Wilson second overall in the 2021 NFL Draft. We\'ll see if Saleh makes the move as the 2022-2023 season rolls on.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit SNY, CBS Sports, and H/T Sportskeeda.     ', ""5 rookie quarterbacks who won in the playoffs ft. Ben Roethlisberger and more  Saturday's Wild Card playoff game saw rookie quarterback Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers defeat the Seattle Seahawks 41-23. It was an impressive display that raised the question of how often quarterbacks lead their teams to playoff wins in their debut seasons.  While many have led their teams to the playoffs, only a select few have managed to achieve the feat of winning a playoff game in their first season. Here is a list of 5 quarterbacks to have won a playoff game in their rookie season.                   #1. Ben Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh Steelers (2004 season)  AFC Wild Card Playoffs - Former Pittsburgh Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Ben Roethlisberger in the first round of the 2004 NFL draft. Initially, he was the third-choice quarterback on the team behind Tommy Maddox and Charlie Batch. However, due to an injury to Batch during the preseason (and poor performances) and an injury to Maddox in Week 3, Roethlisberger was given an opportunity. He led the team to win a playoffs game in his rookie season.

He made his playoff debut in the Divisional round against the New York Jets and helped lead the team to victory in overtime with a game-winning field goal. The Steelers lost the AFC championship game to eventual Super Bowl champions the New England Patriots. #2. Joe Flacco, Baltimore Ravens (2008 season)  New York Jets Joe Flacco     The Baltimore Ravens selected Joe Flacco as the 18th overall pick in 2008 NFL draft. Flacco was meant to be the third-choice quarterback, but due to injuries to starter Kyle Boller and an illness to Tro Smit, Flacco was given the nod. Flacco finished his rookie season with a pass completion percentage of 60.0%, 2,971 yards, and 16 touchdowns. Flacco and the Ravens secured their place in the playoffs and defeated the Miami Dolphins 27-9 in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. Flacco became the first quarterback to win two consecutive playoff games in their rookie season after a 13-10 divisional-round victory over the Tennessee Titans. The Ravens lost the AFC championship game against the Steelers 14-23. #3. Mark Sanchez, New York Jets (2009 season)  Jacksonville Jaguars v New York Jets     Mark Sanchez was taken in the first round of the 2009 NFL draft. The New York Jets traded their first- and second-round selections, as well as three players, to the Cleveland Browns to take him fifth overall. The 2009 season began on a high note for Sanchez, winning three consecutive Pepsi Rookie of the Week awards in the first three weeks of the campaign. He also made history by becoming the first rookie quarterback to start and win his first three NFL games. Warren Sharp@SharpFootballlast Jets QB with a winning record in New York was Mark Sanchez8-12: Zach Wilson1-7: Joe Flacco1-2: Mike White13-25: Sam Darnold0-2: Luke Falk0-1: Trevor Siemian5-11: Josh McCown1-6: Bryce Petty13-14: Ryan Fitzpatrick1-2: Mike Vick12-18: Geno Smith33-29: Mark Sanchez1516133     However, the remainder of the season was not as smooth. In Week 4, Sanchez threw an interception that led to a 99-yard touchdown. In Week 6, he threw five interceptions in a 16-13 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Sanchez and the Jets rallied to finish the regular season with a 9-7 record, securing a spot in the playoffs. In the Wild Card round, they secured a 24-14 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. Sanchez and the team went on to win the Divisional round game against the San Diego Chargers 17-14. Sanchez became the second rookie quarterback in NFL history to win his first two consecutive playoff games following Joe Flacco in 2008. Despite their success, the Jets eventually lost their AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts with a score of 30-17, giving up an 11-point lead. #4. Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks (2012 season) Russell Wilson - St. Louis Rams v Seattle Seahawks, 2012     Russell Wilson was selected by the Seahawks as the 75th overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft. After competing for the starter position with veteran quarterback Matt Flynn and Tarvaris Jackson, Wilson was given the nod for the 2021 season. Wilson threw for 3,118 yards and 26 touchdowns in his rookie season, tying the record set by Peyton Manning for most touchdown passes by a rookie. Wilson's ability as a running quarterback contributed to 489 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. Led by Wilson, the Seahawks secured a playoff spot and went on to win their wild-card round game against the Washington Redskins by a score of 24-14. Wilson had a solid performance, throwing for 187 yards and rushing for 67 yards. They would eventually lose the divisional round game against the Atlanta Falcons by a field goal with 31 seconds left on the clock. #5. Brock Purdy, San Francisco 49ers (2022 season)  NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Seattle Seahawks v San Francisco 49ers     Brock Purdy was selected as the 262nd overall pick in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL draft. After injuries to initial starters Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo, Purdy was given the nod to start in Week 13. To the amazement of many, Purdy put up impressive numbers, throwing for 1,374 yards and 14 total touchdowns in five games as the 49ers starting quarterback. The 49ers met the Seahawks in the Wild Card game of the playoffs and won 41-23.Purdy threw for 332 yards and three passing touchdowns, as well as scoring a rushing touchdown. Purdy will have the chance to become the third rookie quarterback to win consecutive playoff games.     ""]"

The New Orleans Saints will face off against the Arizona Cardinals in a Week 7 Thursday night matchup. This game will see two vastly different styles collide, as the run-heavy offense of the Saints will be paying a visit to the pass-first Arizona offense. The game is set, but the question of who will start under center for New Orleans is still up in the air.  Their quarterback room for has been one of the most interesting in the league since Taysom Hill joined in 2017. There has always been an air of mystery about the position due to the verstility that Hill brings. The main issue in recent times is that starting quarterback Jameis Winston has been injured. He tore his ACL last season and has had four fractured vertebrae in his back this campaign. With his return imminent, will he start in Week 7?        Though it is not 100% certain, Andy Dalton looks set to get the nod against the Cardinals.           Winston is simply too valuable to risk rushing back, especially with the nature of his injury. With Dalton available, the likelihood is that Winston will be nursed back slowly. How have the Saints' quarterbacks faired this season? Seattle Seahawks v New Orleans Saints Andy Dalton is a backup QB who has started in Winston's absence. He is a solid quarterback and a decent safety blanket for a team built around the running talents of perennial Pro Bowler Alvin Kamara. With Winston training this week, his return is coming soon.     New Orleans' quarterback play has been a mixed bag this season, with their performances being inconsistent. Winston has played four games this season and has racked up four touchdowns and five interceptions. Dalton has played in the last three games and has racked up three touchdowns against a lone interception. Then there's Taysom Hill, the Saints' Swiss army knife. He is so versatile that he can't seem to lock up any position. He plays backup for Dalton and Winston at QB and is also a tight end. He rarely plays under center, but when he does, it's usually to run the ball on important downs.With their season quickly falling away from them, the 2-4 New Orleans need to come away with a win in Week 7 against the Cardinals.     "", 'Most overrated NFL fantasy player debate see fans side with rookie QB - ""College experience screams bust""  One of the most common words used in sports discussion is ""overrated"". It denotes/connotes a certain player\'s lack of performance relative to his/her potential, but how can it be gauged when no games have been actually been played yet?  That was the question Redditor u/pot8odragon posed late on Tuesday. He said:        ""There‚Äôs always a player that‚Äôs hyped up as a buy that ends up ruining a fantasy season, or at the very least being a complete failure compared to the hype. Who is that player for you going into 2023?""            Many of them wound up mentioning future Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson: ""Anthony Richardson. Don‚Äôt @ me."" ""I think this is the easiest answer. 53% completion percentage and minimal college experience screams bust. Josh Allen is the exception, not the rule.""                            A rundown of the most ""overrated"" Heisman Trophy winners in the 21st century Tim Tebow is arguably one of the most polarizing Heisman winners ever     While Anthony Richardson never won the Heisman Trophy (Bryce Young did in 2021, and he has to play multiple years first before opinions on him can be made), he is rather fortunate to have done so, as a good number of its winners in modern times have never truly evolved into generational talents, leading to a perception of the award as ""overrated"". While the likes of Derrick Henry (2015), Lamar Jackson (2016), and Joe Burrow (2019) have become legitimate stars, others have not been as blessed. The first 21st-century winner to fail to live up to the promise of the award was Eric Crouch in 2001, who barely played in the NFL before bouncing around teams. Another example is Jason White (2003), who went undrafted in 2005 and decided to focus on business. But the Heisman did not become retroactively notorious until Tim Tebow (2007). Tebow was already known for his outspokenness on his beliefs, which many believe eventually overshadowed his on-field play. The following year\'s winner Sam Bradford, is better known for earning large amounts of money for subpar play.     Mark Ingram II (2009) helped to restore its credibility by putting up a respectable Pro Bowl career, while Cam Newton (2010) became a legitimate superstar. But the next two winners after them seemingly reasserted the Heisman as an ""overrated"" award. Robert Griffin III (2011) had a wonderful rookie season, but injuries derailed his career. But Johnny Manziel, who made award history the following year as its first freshman recipient, severely tarnished its reputation by becoming a massive draft bust who was more famous for wild partying and run-ins with the law than for on-field performance.Jameis Winston (2013) and Marcus Mariota (2014) have had better careers since receiving their award, but it would not arguably shed the ""overrated"" stigma until Henry.     ', 'NFL QB battles: Predicting winners of top 5 neck-and-neck battles  Over the last few days, two NFL teams have named their starters for the 2021 NFL season.   The Jacksonville Jaguars officially, and unsurprisingly, named rookie Trevor Lawrence as their starter for the upcoming campaign. In Denver, Teddy Bridgewater won the quarterback battle and Drew Lock will serve as the backup.         However, there are still three NFL teams that don\'t have an official QB1 for the 2021 season and five others are still figuring out their QB2.           Below, we project the winners of a few quarterback battles. Projected winners for top QB battles in the NFL  #1 New England Patriots - Mac Jones, QB1 Mac Jones on a frozen rope üöÄ pic.twitter.com/rOiDECIg0t‚Äî PFF (@PFF) August 20, 2021 This is probably the most straightforward prediction after recent events.  A miscommunication led to Cam Newton violating the NFL\'s health and safety protocol and the veteran will now miss most of this week\'s practices ahead of the preseason finale.      Rookie Mac Jones will take this opportunity to solidify his case for the starting job further and win it with a good outing in the Patriots\' NFL preseason finale against the New York Giants.  #2 New Orleans Saints - Jameis Winston, QB1 SLING DAT THING @Jaboowins! üí™29-yard TD strike to @CallawayMarquez üôåüì∫: ESPN pic.twitter.com/SPBZczDB1b‚Äî New Orleans Saints (@Saints) August 24, 2021 The battle between Jameis Winston and Taysom Hill has gone on longer than expected, but the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback is finally starting to pull ahead.  Winston is playing with confidence and has been efficient while leading the offense during the preseason. The former number one overall pick already had the advantage due to his history of putting up big passing numbers.      With Winston as the starter, Taysom Hill can still carve out a specialty role to get game time.  #3 San Francisco 49ers - Jimmy Garoppolo, QB1 Jimmy Garoppolo has ‚Äúa pretty good idea‚Äù of who‚Äôs starting for the #49ers Week 1. This is the unbothered answer of a man who spends zero time on Twitter. pic.twitter.com/2KT366w4L5‚Äî Lydia (@limajuliettango) August 25, 2021 Trey Lance might be the better NFL quarterback prospect, but the San Francisco 49ers have over $20 million invested in Jimmy Garoppolo this year and he\'s more experienced.  That\'s not to say the 49ers can\'t make a change later in the season if they are eliminated from playoff contention, or Garoppolo struggles or gets injured. The best-case scenario is to put Lance in before the NFL trade deadline if he\'s still the better player and trade Garoppolo to a needy team.     #4 Pittsburgh Steelers - Mason Rudolph, QB2  A very underrated play of the night here from Mason Rudolph. Free rusher in his face, avoids the sack and has great awareness to try and fight to move the chains. Take your hat off and hand it to 2 here, with some help from Finney and Green. I loved this. #Steelers pic.twitter.com/3QsOiUGJ3z‚Äî Josh Carney (@ByJoshCarney) August 22, 2021 Dwayne Haskins was announced as the Steelers\' NFL preseason finale starter, meaning Mason Rudolph will be the backup to Ben Roethlisberger this year.  Haskins still has to beat Joshua Dobbs for a roster spot, which should be easy if he plays well against the Carolina Panthers\' starting defense. This year, Haskins had a solid shot at winning QB2, but Rudolph\'s strong NFL preseason performances seem to have won him the battle.     #5 Dallas Cowboys - Cooper Rush, QB2 Head coach Mike McCarthy confirmed it will be Cooper Rush taking the first-team reps at quarterback during today\'s press conference.üó£Ô∏è ""He has earned this opportunity, absolutely."" üó£Ô∏è‚Äî Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) August 23, 2021 In a surprising turn of events, Cooper Rush quietly climbed the depth chart during the NFL preseason and is in line to be the Dallas Cowboys\' backup quarterback for the 2021 season.  Garrett Gilbert entered camp as Dak Prescott\'s backup but had a disastrous outing against the Houston Texans. Rush went 25-of-38 for 256 yards and two touchdowns in preseason action. Between Rush and Gilbert, the former looked like the better NFL quarterback under pressure and proved he can lead the offense down the field. Rush was the Cowboys\' backup quarterback from 2017-2019 before Andy Dalton took over in 2020 but earned his spot back.     ', ""New Orleans Saints: 3 players the team could build around in the 2021 NFL season  The post-Drew Brees era begins this season in New Orleans. After yet another postseason heartbreak for Saints fans, the franchise finds itself at a tipping point.  Do they continue to go all-in on a Super Bowl or is it time to start a full-blown rebuild?        Longtime head coach Sean Payton won‚Äôt be interested in a teardown and, even without Brees, he has a squad capable of challenging for the Super Bowl this season, but only just.           So who are the key players the New Orleans franchise needs to build around to ensure sustained success?  Which players can be the cornerstones for the New Orleans Saints?          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by New Orleans Saints (@saints) #1 - Alvin Kamara Star running back Alvin Kamara is the number one player the New Orleans franchise should build its future around.     The 25-year-old is simply electric on the gridiron, whether he is carrying the ball out of the backfield or catching a screen pass. He is, without a doubt, one of the brightest young stars in the NFL today. Kamara is already a four-time Pro Bowler and looks set to break league records during his career. Last season, the running back had 935 yards rushing and 756 yards receiving with a combined 21 touchdowns. He's young, fast, strong, and makes big plays. Alvin Kamara is the future of the New Orleans Saints franchise.  #2 - Michael Thomas Wide receiver Michael Thomas, 28, is another player the Saints should construct their future around. All the star wideout has done since entering the league back in 2016 is catch passes and score touchdowns. The six-foot-three WR holds the NFL record for most receptions over his first five seasons in the league. He also led the NFL in receiving yards in 2019.     Thomas has been a standout over his first five seasons in the league and, at just 28, is primed for many productive seasons. The combination of Thomas and Kamara is a big problem for any NFL defense.  #3 - Jameis Winston          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Jameis Winston (@jaboowins) It's crazy to think that Jameis Winston is still only 27. It feels like he's been in the league for at least a decade. The Saints quarterback was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2016 and has played six seasons in the NFL.     This may be a controversial pick for some Saints fans who don‚Äôt see Winston as a long-term answer at quarterback for the organization, but at 27 and with a wealth of NFL experience under his belt, Winston is set to for a much-improved performance this season and beyond.He will compete with Taysom Hill for the starting QB role during training camp and we could see both play-callers under center this season.Whatever the result, Winston should be a player the Saints franchise builds around. He is familiar with Sean Payton's offense and has matured from his wild Tampa Bay days.     "", ""Is Cam Newton still playing football?  Cam Newton has had more than a decade-long career, mostly with the Carolina Panthers. After starting his NFL journey in 2011, he was the face of the Panthers until, in 2020, he switched teams and played a season for the New England Patriots.   The Panthers did not lose faith in their former QB and gave him a chance to start a few games last season.        Panthers fans cannot wait to see their favorite QB play this season.

Also, later in this article, fantasy football lovers will get to know whether Newton should be in their 2022 fantasy football draft.      Is Cam Newton still playing football? Newton in action Cam Newton, after playing his ninth season with the Panthers, was released after suffering a series of injuries that led to him missing most of the game for the Panthers in 2019.  In 2020, there was a spot open for the leading quarterback at the Patriots after seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady left for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.        In 2020, Newton signed a one-year deal with the Patriots and started all 15 games as their leading quarterback. However, his performance with the Patriots was one of the least efficient, where he threw for 2,657 yards and completed 242 of 368 passes with eight touchdowns and 10 interceptions. NFL@NFLPanthers agree to terms with Cam Newton.564386104 In 2021, Newton lost his starting QB seat in the Patriots to Mac Jones and was later released by them. After serving as a free agent for a few months, the Panthers took him in after their starting QB Sam Darnold sustained a shoulder injury mid-season.      Where is Cam Newton playing now? Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Carolina Panthers Newton started in five games but could not lead his side to a single victory. Although his level of performance is at its lowest, he still believes he can outplay any QB in the league. He is currently a free agent and is looking for the right team to sign him up. The Panthers are in trouble again this season. Their rookie quarterback Matt Corral has sustained a Lisfranc injury and Sam Darnold's ankle sprain might keep him away from some games. The Panthers are left with QB Baker Mayfield and PJ Walker. Will the Panthers once again sign a deal with Newton for this season?      Cam Newton's fantasy football update and predictions All the teams in the NFL have named their 53-man roster, and Newton is not on any of those lists. Chances are low that Newton will return to the league this year, so drafting him into your fantasy team does not sound like a good idea.    Even if he lands up against the Panthers this season, chances are low that he will start games for them. The Panthers have Baker Mayfield as their starting QB. It is best to look for other alternatives for the QB2 position.      Possible Cam Newton alternatives for your fantasy teamInstead of opting for Newton, there are many options available, with Justin Fields, Jameis Winston, Tua Tagovailoa, and Trevor Lawrence. In fantasy football, you never know who lands up in the top 10 at the end of the league, but these four options seem promising if you need a backup QB.

Will they look at the third game as the final game before Week One and not play starters or will they look at this game as a game still two weeks away from the opener with plenty of time for recovery?  From injuries to starters to who to watch, here's a preview of what to expect when the Saints square off against the Cardinals.        Previewing Arizona Cardinals versus New Orleans Saints           Arizona Cardinals Injuries Overall, the team is in relatively good shape. The most notable injury is to DeAndre Hopkins, who is listed as questionable on ESPN's unofficial injury report. Tight end Maxx Williams and Justin Pugh are also facing injury concerns.

Additionally, the Cardinals may hold out Kyler Murray. He didn't play in Week One and only threw the ball four times in Week Two. Kliff Kingsbury is likely inclined to hold out Murray in this game. If Murray does see the field, it will likely be as brief of an appearance as in Week Two.

Lastly, it goes without saying but JJ Watt will almost assuredly not be playing. Arizona Cardinals: who to watch At this point in the preseason, many of the position battles are winding their way down. With every passing day, the roster is becoming more solidified. That said, it is worth paying attention to Rondale Moore and Andy Isabella. Rondale Moore is currently competing to win the starting kick and punt returning positions. Meanwhile, Isabella is attempting to make the coaches think twice before encasing Christian Kirk in cement as the third-string receiver. New Orleans Saints Injuries The Saints have had some issues with injuries on the offensive side of the ball. Of course, Michael Thomas will be out for quite some time. Additionally, Tre'Quan Smith, Adam Trautman, and Nick Vannett are all questionable, according to ESPN.     On defense, however, the Saints are almost 100 percent with their starters. The only starter with any issues will be cornerback Ken Crawley, who is expected to be out for a couple of weeks.     The Saints will also be without kicker Wil Lutz, who could be out for up to eight weeks with a core injury that may require surgery. New Orleans Saints starters Jameis Winston has won the starting quarterback job over Taysom Hill. While it pretty much guarantees Hill will get some playing time in this game, the jury is still out on Winston. In 2019's preseason, Drew Brees played in the third game but not the final game. Will Sean Payton look at Week three as the third game or the final game?     It would make sense for the Saints to start Winston to help him build chemistry and get focused for Week One. If he does play, only expect a half of football or less from him. New Orleans Saints: who to watch Keep an eye on Taysom Hill. This game will be his best chance to show the Saints what they're going to be missing out on in 2021. Will Hill ball out in an act of protest or will he go into a shell and sleepwalk through the game? How he plays this game could show what kind of state he will be in for his special packages that Sean Payton will be using in 2021. Jacksonville Jaguars v Baltimore Ravens     Additionally, keep an eye on Aldrick Rosas. How Lutz's replacement plays in this game could be an accurate preview of how well he does in the regular season. Arizona Cardinals versus New Orleans Saints prediction The Cardinals and the Saints will not see much from their starters in this game. However, Taysom Hill has show a lot of flash in the NFL. Angered by the decision to start Jameis Winston, Hill will come out firing for a dominating performance. Cardinals backup Colt McCoy will be unable to hang and the Cardinals will lose by two touchdowns.     "", ""Is the Heisman Trophy only for quarterbacks? History of the prestigious award explored  The Heisman Trophy is awarded to the best college football player of the regular college season. It has been awarded since 1935 and is based on amateur football players' performances. The Heisman is a big deal, and only the best from college football have been privileged to hoist the trophy after the regular college season.  Though they seem to win it nearly every season, the Heisman award is not just for quarterbacks.        Over the years, we have seen many talented Heisman winners, most of whom were the quarterbacks of NCAA powerhouses. It thus begs the question, since when did the Heisman belong to QBs almost exclusively? The question becomes even more valid when you consider how many QB Heisman winners ended up as busts following their entry into the NFL.              View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Have any non-quarterbacks won the Heisman Trophy? Yes, several non-quarterbacks have won the most prestigious award in college football since the award's inception in 1935. In fact, the first three winners of the Heisman were not QBs, as they were halfbacks and defensive backs. The most recent non-quarterback to win it was DeVonta Smith of Alabama, who won it in 2020.     As of December 10, 2022, fifty non-quarterback winners of the Heisman have been in college football history. The voting is pretty balanced; if you deserve it, you will win it.

Since being selected by the New Orleans Saints in the 2017 NFL Draft, Alvin Kamara has overseen a productive career as a running back.  Due to a potential ban for an alleged incident that occurred during the Pro Bowl weekend earlier this year, Kamara was picked up at a discount. According to many sources, it is ""increasingly more improbable"" that he will be suspended in 2022.

The Saints back may have more opportunities to score this year because of New Orleans\' more potent offense. Even with Jameis Winston at the helm, he still has impressive numbers. Kamara is, without a doubt, a viable RB1 option, but since 2017, he has missed many games. In addition, he now poses a concern to fantasy gamers due to his injuries. Should Alvin Kamara be traded at this time?      Alvin Kamara\'s value as a fantasy player New Orleans Saints v Carolina Panthers In search of his sixth-straight season in the top 10 in fantasy football, Kamara is also entering his sixth NFL season. The best part is that he will continue to be a prominent target in the passing game as he is set to become New Orleans\' starting running back.  Nevertheless, there are issues. Due to his ongoing on- and off-field difficulties, Kamara\'s performance last season suffered significantly without Drew Brees present. He is also unlikely to last for 17 games.     Additionally, due to an offseason arrest, Kamara might also face a multiple-game suspension. When healthy, the 27-year-old is a surefire RB1 producer. Still, until his off-field issues are fully rectified, he\'ll be a questionable premature pick. Fantasy Sports@FantasySPWeek 5 Fantasy Football Trade Value Charts: Alvin Kamara The Perfect Buy-Low Candidate: Alvin Kamara has not been healthy to start this season and has certainly let down the fantasy owners who drafted him with their first or second overall selection.‚Ä¶ dlvr.it/SZWSM983 You can keep gambling with him, but it appears to be better to trade him for a top-tier running back or wide receiver. His participation in major practices has been reduced, and there is a risk he could miss a few games in the near future.      Alvin Kamara\'s fit into the Saints offense Alvin Kamara has a very special role in longtime offensive coordinator Pete Carmichael\'s attacking system. The running back can do virtually anything on offense. He can run downhill like a power back, run around the tackle box like a speed back, and catch passes out of the backfield like a receiving back. Additionally, he can line up on the line of scrimmage and beat cornerbacks with his refined route-running ability.Similar to tight end Taysom Hill, he is also somewhat of an advanced \'Swiss Army Knife\' player.

24,Justin Fields,"['Colin Cowherd takes dig at Cam Newton while undermining Justin Fields‚Äô performances - ‚ÄúPeople fell for the spectacular‚Äù  Justin Fields\' NFL career hasn\'t gone as many would have thought when he was drafted by the Chicago Bears. There are a few reasons why, but for many, Fields hasn\'t been surrounded with good enough talent.  Last season, the offensive line was decent enough, but Fields still didn\'t give fans enough hope to show he is the guy moving forward. He is just two years into his career, so maybe he needs some slack. But FS1\'s Colin Cowherd isn\'t doing so.        Cowherd thinks that the time is now for Fields to show what he can do as he has the offensive weapons around him. However, Cowherd said that many have fallen for the spectacular with Fields as his running capabilities are incredible and likened him to former running quarterback Cam Newton.           ‚ÄúI watched this with Cam Newton a little bit,"" Cowherd said on ""The Herd."" ""Cam was a highlight guy, a YouTube guy, but struggled on basic stuff, and it\'s easy for the fans in the media, fall for sensational and what it becomes is like a bad action movie. Two hours, three really good scenes surrounded by crap. ""Nothing against Cam, he could not complete enough passes. Never had back-to-back winning seasons, but people fell for the spectacular.‚Äù     Herd w/Colin Cowherd@TheHerdNo more excuses for Justin Fields and the Bears:""This should be a playoff team."" ‚Äî @ColinCowherd25732 What Cowherd is saying is that with Justin Fields there are a few good plays every game, and the rest isn\'t good viewing, meaning he needs to find consistency in his game. Will he finally get it this year? Time will tell.  Can Justin Fields and the Bears challenge for the NFC North? Justin Fields     Some Bears fans hope Chicago can challenge to win the NFC North, but for that to happen, Justin Fields needs to take that next step as a quarterback. In his two NFL seasons , Fields is 5-20 as a starter, has thrown 24 touchdowns to 21 interceptions and has a completion percentage of just 57.9.    Those numbers need to improve, and with D.J. Moore, Darnell Mooney, Robert Tonyan and Cole Kmet and running backs in Kahlil Herbert and D\'Onta Foreman, Justin Fields has some weapons to work with.     The defense was the worst in football for points allowed (27.2 per game), so that needs to tighten up as well.   But the main thing is for Justin Fields to improve as a quarterback and to show why he was such a high draft pick. He has shown flashes of his talent, but time has come to show some level of consistency.     ', ""Most QB rushing yards in a quarter: Justin Fields creates history vs. Lions  Justin Fields has officially arrived. Week after week, he does things many quarterbacks have not done yet or haven't done in a long time, and Week 17 is no different. He put up 105 rushing yards in a quarter, which is an incredible feat.   In fact, it's the most by a single player in the last 45 years.         Elias Sports Bureau@EliasSportsJalen Hurts' 103 first-quarter rushing yards are the most single-quarter rushing yards by a QB over the last 45 seasons. The only other QB to post 100+ in a single quarter over that span was Terrelle Pryor, who had 100 in the first quarter against Pittsburgh in 2013. @Eagles3311           That record had been set by Jalen Hurts earlier in the season, but was just eclipsed by Fields in the first quarter against the woeful Detroit Lions.  Should this pace continue (though 400 yards rushing is nearly impossible), he'd easily break his own record for most rushing yards by a quarterback in a single game.   Top three single-quarter rushing performances by a quarterback ft. Justin Fields     While the Detroit Lions' run defense is impressively bad (just ask the Carolina Panthers), the feat Fields pulled off is incredible nonetheless. His 105 rushing yards in a quarter would be a great single game total for a quarterback.  Earlier this year, Hurts ran all over the Green Bay Packers in a 40-33 win. He started the game with 103 yards and then finished with 157 at 9.2 yards per carry. It was a dominant effort.      The third time a quarterback has done this was by Terrelle Pryor, who eclipsed the century mark in a quarter against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2013.      With this dominant effort (Fields' total is at 105 midway through the second quarter), he's inching closer and closer to Lamar Jackson's single-season record. Lamar Jackson holds the record Justin Fields is nearing In 2019, Jackson recorded 1,206 yards in an MVP-winning campaign. Fields now needs less than 100 yards in this week and next week to hold the record.     It should be noted that the initial record was set in a 16-game season and Fields is enjoying an 18-game season, but it is impressive nonetheless as Justin Fields missed one game due to injury.      "", 'How Justin Fields‚Äô Yoga Breathing Technique Helped Him Perform at His Best against the Vikings?  American quarterback Justin Fields probably played what was, till date, his best half in NFL football on Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings. The Chicago Bears\' comeback, though, fell short, resulting in a 29-22 loss.  After the loss, the 23-year-old quarterback said that it was the first time in his short NFL career that he felt most at ease on the field. Fields said that he was able to play at his own pace and not let the Vikings defense speed him up.                View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Justin Fields subsequently said that playing quarterback demands a rhythm. The player cannot drop back superfast or throw it really fast. Staying relaxed and calm during the game is key.  ""We throw certain routes all day, so pretty much just treat everything like routes on air,"" the young player said.  He added that it\'s good to try and stay as calm and in the rhythm as possible. Fields has been working on learning to play at his own speed and rhythm. He attributes his success on Sunday to a new way of breathing he started using recently.      So what is this new breathing technique he was talking about? Read on to find out more.  Justin Fields\' Yoga Breathing Technique Justin Fields attributed his recent success on the field against the Minnesota Vikings to a new breathing technique. The young player said that he has been working on his breathing during games ""like in slow like four seconds and out slow"". Fields says that the breathing technique automatically keeps him more calm and collected during games. The player also doesn\'t like doing pregame speeches, as he feels that ""I‚Äôm so much calmer than everybody else"". When the defensive guys are all juiced up ready to go, Justin Fields just tries to stay chill.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Justin Fields pays a lot of attention to his breathing, and the Bears set up yoga classes a few days before each game. The quarterback, who is only in his second year, found that the breathing exercise helped him stay calm, so he decided to use it on Sunday against the Vikings. The young quarterback for the Bears played a great 30 minutes of football in the second half against the Vikings. Fields made 12 of 13 throws, which gave him 135 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for 36 yards, while a 53-yard touchdown run was taken away because of an illegal block. Fields\' accuracy and quick decisions in Minnesota were evidence of the small steps forward the Bears have been talking about.        Justin Fields has always seemed relaxed and in control. His face almost never changes, no matter the game situation. Fields says, though, that it wasn\'t always like this and has taken time. He says that his calmness has come with time and mistakes. Only last year, the player felt that he had to speed himself up or be crazy pumped up like everybody else. However, now the player reckons that while playing quarterback, staying calm and relaxed pays off more in terms of a better performance.  Takeaway Fields has tried to bring that calmness, steady hand, and maybe even the new breathing exercise into every game during his second year with the Bears. That includes how he feels about being slowly turned into the NFL quarterback his talent suggests he can be.  We all want to see the results of our work right away. Fields knows that at his level, that\'s not how it works, and rushing the process seldom helps. He understands that ""progress takes patience"".             View this post on Instagram            Instagram PostPatience and deep breathing helped Fields almost clinch the game in the second half.

In the last five games, he has recorded 408 rushing yards in 49 attempts and scored three touchdowns. But if we compare him to the league's undefeated QB, Philadelphia Eagles' Jalen Hurts, then he definitely falls short. Hurts has started in all the games this season for the Eagles and hasn't lost a single matchup.

Justin Fields vs. Jalen Hurts: Head-to-head in fantasy football Both players are healthy and are not suffering from any injuries. In Week 10, the Bears will face the Detroit Lions, so Fields has an advantage in scoring more fantasy points.

Chicago Bears Quarterback Justin Fields But if we talk about consistency, Hurts has thrown for 200+ yards in seven of the eight games he has played in. In the last three games, he scored two or more touchdowns and is expected to continue with the same performance in the upcoming game against the Washington Commanders.        If you are a fantasy football manager and are confused between Justin Fields and Jalen Hurts, then we would suggest that you start with Hurts this week. He is healthy and has led the Eagles to eight back-to-back game wins.So far, Hurts has scored 196.3 fantasy points with an average of 24.5 points per game.

On that note, let\'s take a deep dive into Justin Fields\' profile.                   2021 NFL Draft Prospect: Justin Fields\' Profile -- Height: 6\' 3"". -- Weight: 228 pounds. -- Position: Quarterback. -- School: Ohio State.  2021 NFL Draft Prospect: Justin Fields\' Strengths Ohio State QB Justin Fields Justin Fields showed at Ohio State that he has a huge arm and possesses the ability to make throws.  Fields also showed his patience inside the pocket, which is huge, coupled with his ability to run the football. He also showed that he could keep his eyes down the field and isn\'t afraid to check down the football.     Justin Fields has the ability to sell ball fakes and remains calm under pressure. His ability to buy time for his receivers and get them to open is exceptional. He may be the best quarterback in the upcoming NFL Draft while throwing on the run. giving kyle shanahan justin fields will break the leaguepic.twitter.com/pa0FN3uS5r‚Äî Austin Gayle (@PFF_AustinGayle) March 26, 2021 The former Ohio State quarterback possesses everything that NFL teams look for in a franchise quarterback.  His arm talent is what could take him to the next level in the NFL. Fields doesn\'t lose strength throwing the football on the run. Whether he throws 20 yards down the field or 50 yards, Justin Fields\' throws do not suffer from inconsistency.     Justin Fields can pick and choose his spots to run the football. If he sees an opening, he can easily change the game with one run. His baseball background gives him the ability to slide with ease instead of taking the big hits.  2021 NFL Draft Prospect: Justin Fields\' Weaknesses Ohio State QB Justin Fields Justin Fields has seen his NFL draft stock take a hit since the end of the 2020 college season.  It\'s almost like scouts watched his film and went through it with a fine tooth comb. The weaknesses that Justin Fields possesses are tough to overlook, though.     During his time at Ohio State, Justin Fields showed that he could struggle with pocket awareness. Like top Draft prospect Trevor Lawrence, Fields can get rattled at times under pressure.  Most of his weakness stems from his inexperience as a starter, as he only started one full season at Ohio State.

Scouts also found that he fails to check the ball down and tries throwing the football down the field. Considering all the weaknesses that scouts have found on Fields, it makes sense as to why his Draft stock has fallen.      2021 NFL Draft Prospect: Justin Fields\' Career at Ohio State Ohio State QB Justin Fields Since transferring from Georgia, Justin Fields has brought a different look to the Ohio State offense.  During his time at Ohio State, Fields didn\'t throw double-digit interceptions in each of his last two seasons. Justin Fields put together his best performance during the 2019-20 season, as he threw 41 touchdowns and three interceptions while passing for more than 3,000 yards.     Fields was selected as the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year honors in both 2019 and 2020. However, the former Ohio State quarterback came up short of a national championship and the Heisman Trophy. Nevertheless, he still put together one and a half successful seasons with the team. At one point, Justin Fields was battling Trevor Lawrence for the number one quarterback prospect in the 2021 NFL Draft. Fields was also projected to be the first or second overall pick in the Draft. There are some mock drafts that have him in the top ten and some that have him going in the fourth round.  Let\'s take a look at how Justin Fields put together a successful career at Ohio State.  2021 NFL Draft Prospect: Justin Fields\' Career Passing Stats at Ohio State-- Completions: 396.-- Attempts: 579.-- Completion Percentage: 68.4.-- Passing Yards: 5,373.     -- Passing Touchdowns: 63.-- Interceptions: 9.2021 NFL Draft Prospect: Justin Fields\' Career Rushing Stats at Ohio State-- Rushing Attempts: 218.-- Rushing Yards: 867.-- Rushing Touchdowns: 15.     ', 'Colin Cowherd unleashes criticism on Justin Fields, calls Bears star a \'Bad Quarterback\' - ‚ÄúNo more excuses‚Äù  Justin Fields and the Chicago Bears are gearing up for a very critical season for the franchise. The Bears view Fields as their franchise quarterback, due to which they traded away the first pick of this year\'s draft. The NFC North team got a lot of assets in return, with which they were able to build a better roster.  Given that the franchise has finally put a good roster around him, the former Ohio State quarterback is under immense pressure to perform. Colin Cowherd has no optimism in Fields, and he recently labeled the Bears star as a ""bad quarterback"".        Here\'s what he said on Herd With Colin Cowherd:           ""I think an interesting team that has a decision to make is the Chicago Bears, I think are very interesting and so you know, when a team is trying to figure out if their quarterback is the guy they always blame people. It should be noted Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert behind atrocious offensive lines were great really quickly. ""The Bears O-Line last year was middle of the pack. So, it wasn\'t atrocious. So, two years in with Justin Fields, he\'s completing 59% of his throws, almost as many picks as touchdowns, and a bad passer rating. He\'s a bad quarterback, he\'s also 1-8 in Division. ""The O-line is not a disaster. They\'ve hit on a couple of the young ones. The tight end group, the wide receiver group now full of really good players, I won\'t count Chase Claypool. Mooney, DJ Moore, Cole Kmet, Robert Tonyan very productive good players. No more excuses.""     It is true that Justin Fields has been underwhelming so far in the NFL, but Cowherd was too harsh on the Chicago Bears quarterback. Many people were left impressed by what the 24-year-old quarterback achieved last season, without any star player around him. Last season, Fields had a passer rating of 85.2 with 2,242 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions in 15 games. He also rushed for 1,143 rushing yards on 160 carries while scoring eight rushing TDs. Herd w/Colin Cowherd@TheHerdNo more excuses for Justin Fields and the Bears:""This should be a playoff team."" ‚Äî @ColinCowherd26234  Justin Fields is seen as QB1 in fantasy football for 2023 season     Justin Fields: Chicago Bears Offseason Workout Based on his performance last season and the caliber of his surrounding cast, Justin Fields is projected to be the QB1 in fantasy football this upcoming season. Last year, Jalen Hurts took the leap and surprised everyone. Similarly, in this upcoming season, everything is in place for Fields to silence his critics. His ability to run with the ball is special, and the addition of Moore and Tonyan will boost his passing ability as well.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Herd with Colin Cowherd and H/T Sportskeeda.     ', ""Darnell Mooney's Week 9 fantasy outlook: Is the underwhelming Bears receiver due a big performance?  Darnell Mooney has been the only relevant wide receiver for the Chicago Bears in fantasy football this season. The rest have not been worth looking at and that includes tight end Cole Kmet, who scored his first touchdown of the campaign last week.  Relevant is a strong word, as Mooney's inability to score points has hindered his fantasy outlook. As the Bears have leaned on their top-ranked rushing attack, Mooney has scored zero touchdowns thus far. Chicago have the fewest passing attempts in the NFL, and Mooney has just three targets in the end zone so far this season.        Kevin Lapka@kevcharles112You should buy low on Darnell Mooney in fantasy RIGHT NOWThe presence of Claypool is going to open things up for Mooney the same way the presence of Allen Robinson opened things up for him last yearMooney stock: 6           Darnell Mooney might not inspire a lot of confidence right now, but he is a good option during bye weeks or covering for injured players. He faces an interesting matchup against the Miami Dolphins, who rank eighth versus wide receivers in fantasy. With six teams on a bye this week, Mooney should be considered here if you are in a tight spot. Darnell Mooney's stats and fantasy prediction Washington Commanders v Chicago Bears     Darnell Mooney had 70 receiving yards after catching all five of his targets in the eighth game of the season. Mooney was, alas, held scoreless once again. However, Mooney has above 50 receiving yards in five straight games, recording an average of 67.4 yards per game after a sluggish start in his first three outings. Although Mooney's weekly target totals are underwhelming (he has only played one game so far with more than six targets), he and Justin Fields have recently developed some chemistry. Mooney has excellent potential as a WR3 and WR4 player, but he is not the WR2 you may have imagined he was before the draft season. The issue is that the Bears just don't throw the ball very often. Another factor that has to be taken into consideration is that Chicago have traded for Chase Claypool. The arrival of the former Pittsburgh Steelers receiver could signal a change in intent for the Bears offense, as they may be looking to develop their passing game. Or it could mean fewer targets for Mooney. That remains to be seen and makes Mooney's outlook hard to predict.         Miami have been poor against the pass this season, which bodes well for Mooney this week. The game script leans towards a high-scoring game in the Dolphins' favor, which could result in the Bears passing the ball more than they'd like. This is another tick next to Darnell Mooney's projections.With six teams having bye weeks in Week 9, Mooney should be considered in more leagues. One of the biggest wide receiver busts of the season has a rare chance to make a good impression. We will see if he can take it on Sunday.     ""]"
25,Tyler Huntley,"[""3 reasons why the Ravens and Cowboys need CJ Beathard  CJ Beathard is currently playing for his career in Florida. North of his position, the Ravens are at Defcon One at backup quarterback. West of his position, the Cowboys are drawing straws at backup quarterback.  Both teams currently do not have a solution for the position. Tyler Huntley, a third-string quarterback, is the Ravens' current backup. Meanwhile, the Cowboys can't pick from three third-string quarterbacks, which makes CJ Beathard a great fit for both teams.         Here's why both teams should be competing to get the quarterback this summer.            #1 CJ Beathard's Week-Two performance For those who made it to the end of the Monday Night Football broadcast, they were rewarded with an offensive explosion. CJ Beathard came into the game down multiple possessions, and ended the game with a two-point deficit. Beathard went nine for 14, and threw for 121 yards and two touchdowns in about half a quarter. Jaguars QB Competition Update:CJ Beathard: 13/16, 102 yds, 1 TD, 0 sacksTrevor Lawrence: 6/9, 71 yds, 0 TD, 2 sacksNumbers don't lie #Hawkeyes pic.twitter.com/GlCtdxFQmc‚Äî Barstool Hawkeyes (@BarstoolUIowa) August 22, 2021 Before Beathard, the Jaguars had scored three points. Beathard helped the Jaguars score 18 points in the fourth quarter. No backup Ravens or Cowboys quarterback has been able to come anywhere close to that type of performance.      #2 CJ Beathard's experience While the Cowboys and Ravens' backups have all barely seen the field during the regular season, CJ Beathard has started 12 games in the NFL.  Any NFL experience is good experience. The more experience a quarterback has, the more comfortable they are while running an NFL offense in the heat of the game and the higher the chances of a good output from the team.     12 games of experience is a massive gap early in a player's career. 12 games is almost a full rookie season. Basically, CJ Beathard has already almost completed a rookie season in the NFL. It could take the Ravens and Cowboys' backups years to get this number of starts as a backup. However, with Beathard, the growing pains are largely done.      #3 CJ Beathard has been on the up Jacksonville Jaguars Training Camp CJ Beathard admittedly started slow early in his career. He was 1-9 in his first ten games. However, since then, he has been on the up, going 1-1. 2020 saw him throw for six touchdowns and zero interceptions. It is unclear what lit the fire under Beathard.That said, after his Week Two performance on Monday Night Football and his 2020 stats, CJ Beathard looks like a ship poised for takeoff. If the Cowboys or Ravens do land him, they might be surprised with what they got.     "", '""Mr. January because he never makes it to February"" - Josh Allen gets mercilessly roasted on social media after Bengals beat Bills in Buffalo\xa0  Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills\' quest to win the franchise\'s first Super Bowl ended in brutal fashion as Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals rolled into Highmark Stadium and beat them 27-10.  As opposed to last year\'s gut-wrenching overtime loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, the Bills were blown away by the Bengals, who advanced to the AFC Championship game. They will take on Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium.        Josh Allen attempted 42 passes and completed 25 for 265 yards and no touchdowns with one interception. He rushed eight times for 26 yards and scored the Bills\' only touchdown. On the flip side, Burrow completed 23 of his 36 pass attempts for 242 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 32 yards on six carries, leading the Bengals to a blowout win.

', ""Week 16: Baltimore Ravens vs. Atlanta Falcons game recap and analysis  The Baltimore Ravens defeated the Atlanta Falcons 17-9 in a hard-fought matchup at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, on Saturday, December 24.  The home side entered the game with a 9-5 record, looking to secure a win to improve their playoff chances. Meanwhile, the Falcons had a record of 5-9 and hoped to end their season on a high note.                   The Ravens get the win in a defensive battle Kicker Justin Tucker The Ravens scored the game's first points with a field goal, while the Falcons were held scoreless in the first quarter. Baltimore added to their lead in the second quarter with a touchdown, a two-point conversion, and another field goal, while the Falcons finally got on the board with a field goal of their own. The third quarter was a defensive battle, with neither team able to find the end zone. The Falcons narrowed the Ravens' lead with another field goal, but Baltimore held on heading into the fourth quarter.     In the final quarter, Baltimore added another field goal to their lead, while the Falcons scored one of their own to narrow the gap. The home team's defense was able to hold on for the win, securing a 17-9 victory over the Falcons. Overall, it was a defensive battle between the two teams, with both offenses struggling to find their rhythm throughout the game. The Ravens' offense put together a couple of long drives that resulted in points, while the Falcons' offense struggled to convert on third downs and had to settle for field goals. Baltimore Ravens@RavensMERRY CLINCHMAS119442884     On Baltimore's offense, quarterback Tyler Huntley had a solid outing, completing 9 out of 17 passes for 115 yards and a touchdown.

Quarterback Desmond Ridder showed signs of promise, completing over 66% of his passes and avoiding any turnovers.Next up, the Falcons will return home to face the Arizona Cardinals, while the Ravens will stay at home to take on the Pittsburgh Steelers. Both teams will be looking to secure victories in their Week 17 matchups.     "", ""Steelers' TJ Watt to make history in Week 18 of 2021 NFL season  TJ Watt has been a defender on fire in 2021. Despite occasional availability issues, the pass rusher has dominated the line of scrimmage this season.   Thanks to his performance on Monday Night Football, Watt has a chance to do something never before seen in the NFL.         Here's a look at what can happen if Week 18 goes well for Watt.           TJ Watt in range of single-season sack record Pittsburgh Steelers v Cincinnati Bengals Despite likely playing in only 15 games this season, Watt has a chance to set a new record for sacks in a season with a big performance in Week 18.  The linebacker has had the most productive season of his career and at 21.5 sacks, he has more sacks earned in a single season than any other player in Steelers history.         With the franchise record out of the way, Watt now sets his sights on the NFL record. A couple of weeks ago, it seemed that Watt could miss the record book entirely.  After the game against the Kansas City Chiefs in which he earned no sacks, his back was up against the wall at 17.5 sacks with two games to play. He needed a massive game against the Browns and that is what he got. Now, suddenly in range of history, Watt needs to earn 1.5 sacks against the Baltimore Ravens to beat Michael Strahan's 22.5-sack season in 2001, according to ESPN via Dov Kleiman.     JJ Watt@JJWattWelcome to the 20+ sack club @_TJWatt! (Only one person ever has done it twice. Imagine if it was your older brother and he bragged about it, that would suck.) Go break the record kid.7:37 AM ¬∑ Jan 3, 2022569713576 The Ravens are the last obstacle for TJ Watt making history. It will be up to them to protect Lamar Jackson or Tyler Huntley.  The Ravens tend to care about records more than other teams, as they famously take preseason wins and losses seriously.  They will be aware of how close Watt is and will do everything in their power to make sure it doesn't happen on their watch. Of course, they might not be able to stop Watt. The Ravens only need to stumble on two plays to give Watt the record.      If Huntley plays, he will also be less likely to dodge Watt if he breaks into the offensive backfield (unlike Lamar Jackson). Big Cat (1-0 in GOTY bets)@BarstoolBigCatTJ Watt has 21.5 sacks and has only played 12 full games this year.8:15 AM ¬∑ Jan 3, 2022193572229 If Watt sets a new record, there will undoubtedly be some detractors that cite the 17-game season as the true reason Watt earned the record.  Without the extra game, they will argue, Watt's accomplishments will have a caveat attached. Advocates will say that Watt still accomplished the feat in 16 games. Detractors will say that Watt would not be playing in this game with a shot if there was no extra game. One thing is clear: there will not be a lack of controversy about this, as it could be the first NFL record that results from adding an extra game.

The first quarter of the game expired following the sack, with Jackson leaving the field shortly after. Jackson never returned in the second quarter of the game as backup quarterback Tyler Huntley officially replaced him, at least temporarily. Huntley filled in for Jackson for the entire second quarter, bringing the Ravens to halftime. The Ravens officially announced that Jackson will not be returning for the second half of the game while his knee is further examined. The Ravens are likely disappointed that Jackson is unable to return to the game. But it is much more important that their superstar quarterback avoids a catastrophic diagnosis.

', 'Robert Griffin III in demand after insane 40 yard dash  Robert Griffin III may be known to new NFL fans as a football analyst, but recently he shook off the cobwebs and ran a blistering 40-yard dash. Participating in the ""Run Rich Run"" charity event during the NFL draft, he posted a remarkable time of 4.48 seconds. To put that into perspective, it was 0.07 seconds faster than what he ran in his own NFL Combine performance.  Rich Eisen Show@RichEisenShowWhen you run a 4.48 40-yard dash, even if for charity and #RunRichRun, people take notice ‚Äî @RGIII talked with us about it and how he\'s gotten phone calls from #NFL execs about a possible return and where he\'d like to go:#DallasCowboys#DirtyBirds #GoBears30444        Since then, he has been contacted by several NFL teams, who will be hoping he is back to his mobile best. He has been open about wanting to play again if the opportunity arises. The Dallas Cowboys, Atlanta Falcons and Chicago Bears are his franchises of choice. He already has a get-out clause in his analyst contract which allows him to leave should a professional football team come calling.           But all of this begs the question, why is he out of the game? The answer to that lies in various injuries during his career. Injuries forced Robert Griffin III out of the league Philadelphia Eagles v Washington Redskins     Griffin III was chosen by the Washington franchise in 2012 as the second overall pick of the draft. He made his name in college as a dual-threat quarterback and did not disappoint in his first season. In his rookie year, he won the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. He led the now Washington Commanders into the postseason and contributed to 27 regular touchdowns in the regular season. His 7 rushing touchdowns led the league. But issues were bubbling under the surface as he had to miss the Pro Bowl with ACL and LCL injuries to his right knee. After surgery, he did not play in the preseason and in 2013 failed to replicate his rookie season form. In the final three games of the season, he was benched to avoid further injuries. In 2014, he missed seven weeks due to a dislocated ankle sustained in Week 2. In 2015, he suffered a nasty concussion during the preseason. After such a glut of injuries, he slipped to third on the depth chart and Griffin III left Washington at the end of the season.     In 2016, after being named the starting quarterback with the Cleveland Browns, he dislocated his shoulder in the opening game. He only returned in Week 14 but was let go at the end of the season. Griffin III remained a free agent throughout 2017. Returning as a backup in 2018 with the Baltimore Ravens, he finally got a chance to start in 2019 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Unfortunately, he tweaked his left hamstring during that game. With so many injuries on his record, especially for a quarterback whose threat was his mobility, teams did not want to take the risk of signing him. When this became apparent, he gave up the field for the booth. Robert Griffin III@RGIIIDon‚Äôt tell people your plans, show them your results.19133But his recent 40-yard dash might once again convince the team that he is back to his best shape and ready to contribute again. If Griffin III can prove himself and stay fit, we really might see him again in the NFL.

This was before the Monday Night Football clash between the New England Patriots and the Arizona Cardinals.  Jalen Hurts finished the game with 217 passing yards, two touchdown passes, 77 rushing yards, and one rushing touchdown. When discussing his performance, RGIII said:        ""People said Jalen Hurts couldn\'t get it done. He couldn\'t operate from the pocket. He\'s not the quarterback of the future.

It remains to be seen whether ESPN will punish the former Washington Commanders quarterback for using such a term on live TV.While it\'s plausible that the use of the slur was nothing more than an unfortunate error, the implications could be dire for the former NFL star. Fans on social media aren\'t buying the apology, and bosses at ESPN might also resonate with that sentiment by punishing Griffin for his error.

The encounter took place in 2018 at Fed Ex Field in Landover, Md., where Messi was preparing for Argentina\'s friendly match against El Salvador.  Alongside Ovechkin stood his teammate Evgeny Kuznetsov and former Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III, creating a star-studded gathering.        For Ovechkin, who is accustomed to meeting fans who admire him, this meeting with Lionel Messi was a dream come true. Speaking to Monumental Network, he expressed his admiration for the soccer legend, acknowledging Messi\'s status as one of the best athletes in the world. Ovechkin\'s appreciation extended to Kuznetsov as well, who shared the honor of being in the presence of Messi. Ovechkin recognized the significance of the moment, referring to it as a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet the current best player in soccer."" Messi, at the age of 27, was dominating La Liga with an impressive tally of 32 goals in 28 games for FC Barcelona. Meanwhile, Ovechkin, 29 at the time, was making waves in the NHL with 47 goals in 73 games for the Washington Capitals. His exceptional performance put him on track to potentially secure the Rocket Richard Trophy as the league\'s leading goal-scorer. As an ardent Barcelona fan and Messi enthusiast, he regarded the encounter as a tremendous honor. Comparing Messi\'s stature to legendary athletes like Michael Jordan, Mark Messier, and Wayne Gretzky, Ovechkin emphasized the magnitude of meeting such an esteemed figure.     Eager to commemorate the occasion, Ovechkin presented Messi with a signed No. 8 Capitals jersey, symbolizing the mutual respect shared between the two sporting greats.

', ""What was Justin Fields‚Äô 40-yard dash time? Revisiting Bears‚Äô dual-threat QB‚Äôs pro day performance  To succeed as a quarterback in the NFL, one must possess more qualities than just arm power and precision. The role is dynamic and appears to be becoming more physically demanding with each new NFL draft class. The NFL Combine is the ideal venue to display such agility and quickness.  Anyone who saw Justin Fields compete at Ohio State during his two-year stint knew that he was a very talented player. However, Fields demonstrated just how quick he was at his pro day on campus.        SportsCenter@SportsCenterJustin Fields was MOVING  He ran 4.44u at Ohio State Pro Day.(via @NFLBrasil) 9240849           Before Justin Fields' Ohio State pro day in 2021, it was assumed that he would be selected among the top ten in the NFL draft. By performing pleasantly during his training, he only served himself. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Fields had an unofficial 40-yard sprint mark of 4.44 seconds, which ranked as the second-fastest speed for a quarterback in 15 years. While many scouts estimated his unofficial timing at that point, one estimated it to be 4.43 seconds. The only quarterback to beat Fields' time at the Scouting Combine since 2006, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter, was Robert Griffin III, who ran a 4.41 at the Combine in 2012.     USA TODAY NFL@usatodaynflHello, Justin Fields. 82 After launching his career at Georgia, Fields threw for 5,373 yards, 63 scores, and nine interceptions during his two years at Ohio State. Is Justin Fields the fastest quarterback in the league now? There are various perspectives on quarterback quickness. The 40-yard dash time is typically the default; however, not all QBs run a 40 at the Combine. Lamar Jackson did not participate in the Combine's running event, but at Louisville's Speed Day in 2017, he had a time of 4.34, making him the league's quickest active quarterback. Justin Fields tops all current quarterbacks with the fourth-fastest official Combine 40-time since 2000 after clocking a 4.44 at the 2021 NFL Combine.     NFL@NFLJustin Fields. 4.43u SPEED. (via @movethesticks) @justnfields: @OhioStateFB Pro Day on @nflnetwork143641012 When Fields ran for 41 yards against the Dallas Cowboys at 21.23 mph, it was the quickest run by any quarterback in the entire 2022 season. Thanks to that run, he was the 15th-fastest carrier on any play last season.In addition, Fields became just the third quarterback in NFL history to surpass 1,000 rushing yards in a season. Before Fields, only Michael Vick and Lamar Jackson had amassed 1,000 running yards while serving as quarterbacks.Fields accomplished this feat, among other things, by making amazing runs, eluding defenders, and flying off at breakneck speed.     "", 'How does Aaron Rodgers to Jets shake up NFC hierarchy? RGIII drops top-5 QB list feat. Dak Prescott  For all intents and purposes, Aaron Rodgers is a lame-duck NFC quarterback. With the New York Jets and Green Bay Packers dancing through the numbers, attention is turning to what the landscape of the conference will look like in 2023. Speaking on Get Up, Robert Griffin III put forward a list of the top quarterbacks in the conference. Put simply, it is shocking to most.   Robert listed Geno Smith as the fifth-best quarterback in the conference. The backup to Russell Wilson entering the conversation after a Wild Card berth is just one surprising aspect of the list. Ahead of Smith, he listed Kyler Murray, who is coming off the worst season of his career.         Get Up@GetUpESPN.@RGIII\'s top five NFC QBs if Rodgers plays for the Jets:1. Jalen Hurts2. Kirk Cousins3. Dak Prescott4. Kyler Murray5. Geno Smith58259           In 2022, Murray threw for 14 touchdowns and seven interceptions while going 3-8 in 11 starts for Arizona Cardinals. The show host then ranked Dak Prescott, who led the league in interceptions, as the third-best. Here\'s how he explained that choice: Will the AFC win the Super Bowl in 2023?       ""You were talking about, \'hey, this guy gets all the hate in the world, but he\'s 53-32 as a starter, he is a winner. He can get it done in any type of way possible.

Don\'t have that recency bias. Look at what he did against the Bucs. That is the quarterback that he is and this year he has to have more playoff success to prove this ranking.""        He then ranked Rodgers\' rival, Kirk Cousins, as the second-best quarterback in the conference. Cousins threw for 29 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 2022 and went 13-4 with the Minnesota Vikings. However, critics still doubt the quarterback\'s ability to show up in most big games.        Lastly, he ranked Jalen Hurts as the best quarterback in the conference. The quarterback who threw for 16 touchdowns and nine interceptions in 2021 before putting on 22 touchdowns and six interceptions in 2022. Critics claim the quarterback\'s 8-7 performance in 2021 casts doubt on his ability to repeat his abilities in 2023.  How does the AFC hierarchy look in comparison with Aaron Rodgers? Aaron Rodgers at Green Bay Packers v Miami Dolphins With the NFC quarterback rankings revealed, most fans claim the AFC has the edge in passer comparisons. Many would agree that (in no particular order) Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Joe Burrow, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, and Justin Herbert tower over at least four of the top five quarterbacks in Robert Griffin III\'s NFC ranking.     Mahomes owns multiple Super Bowl victories. Aaron Rodgers is a four-time MVP. Lamar Jackson has won an MVP, Justin Herbert already has broken NFL records in his career, and Josh Allen has shown relative consistency over the last several years.Will the 2023 season prove the interconference comparison to be a more level playing field than it appears on paper?

Most argued that without the superstar receiver, the team would not only end sluggishly like in past years but would also start slow.  However, one NFL analyst believes the suspension could be a blessing in disguise for the Cardinals. On First Take, Robert Griffin III first spoke about Kyler Murray and how he has the ability to lead the team deep into the postseason.        ""When I\'m talking about Kyler Murray, you talk about his talent and what he\'s able to do as a quarterback with his arm and with his legs and contrary to popular belief, he has carried Arizona Cardinals over the past three years, and he\'s carried them to a place where they are a viable Super Bowl contender.""           He then explained how the loss of Hopkins could benefit the team in the long run. ""Now DeAndre Hopkins getting suspended early in the year is not the greatest thing for him in his career, but it might be the best thing that ever happened to the Cardinals and here\'s why."" He went on to say that the suspension will force the team to explore other avenues.     ""It\'s gonna give [the Cardinals] an opportunity to figure out how to run their offense through other people, whether that be Zach Ertz and Trey McBride, the tight ends, James Connor, the running back, Marquise Brown, the wide receiver, or the other receivers that they have at their disposal there in Arizona‚Ä¶"" Kevin Zimmerman@KZimmermanAZDeAndre Hopkins spent part of yesterday driving around Downtown Phoenix and giving out bottles of water to those who needed it on another very hot day.1442161 Griffin pointed out that the suspension could prove beneficial for Hopkins as well, as it would keep him fresh for the business end of the season.     ""[Arizona] will have to figure out how to get things done without only throwing the ball to DeAndre Hopkins. So it\'s also going to allow Dee-hop to be healthy late in the year when they need him the most... Now it\'s going to be on Kliff Kingsbury early in the year to figure out a different way to get things done."" DeAndre Hopkins\' NFL career so far Dallas Cowboys v Arizona Cardinals     DeAndre Hopkins arrived in the NFL with plenty of expectations on his shoulders, and he has fulfilled them for the most part. The Houston Texans drafted him with the 27th pick in 2013 and wide receiver accumulated 2,000 total yards in his first two NFL seasons.    In 2015, he had the second-best season of his career, posting 1,521 yards and 11 touchdowns. The best season of his career came in 2018 when he earned 1,572 yards and 11 touchdowns. In 2020, Hopkins was traded to the Arizona Cardinals. Paired with Kyler Murray, the wide receiver earned his third-best yardage total in his career with 1,407. However, 2021 was not kind to the player as he managed just 572 yards and eight touchdowns.       With the wide receiver set to miss roughly half of the 2022-23 season, there are question marks over whether his production will decline.

After a knee injury ended his rookie season early, he returned in 2021 to shock the world with his accuracy, leading the league in completion percentage and yards per attempt and returning the Cincinnati Bengals to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 1980\'s.  But ahead of that game, Skip Bayless apparently wanted to steer away from his award-winning comeback season. Speaking on his eponymous show, he decided to compare Burrow to Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin, specifically how he was not as cool as he tried to portray himself as:        ""There\'s something about Joe Burrow that comes across as a kid who\'s not naturally cool, who\'s trying to be cool. It comes across like Macaulay Culkin... That character, obviously, when his parents and siblings left him behind home alone, began to try to do cool adult things that he wasn\'t really that cool at. And that\'s Joe to me now.""           Where did the Joe Burrow-Macaulay Culkin comparison rumors come from?          The Bengals ultimately lost 20-23 to the Los Angeles Rams, after Burrow lost his ""cool"" in the face of Aaron Donald on a fourth-and-1 with under a minute left.  Where did the Joe Burrow-Macaulay Culkin comparison rumors originate? The comparisons to Macaulay Culkin began in late 2019, when Joe Burrow was still playing collegiately at Louisiana State University. After the Tigers defeated the Oklahoma Sooners 63-28 at the Peach Bowl, fans could not help but see that the quarterback resembled the actor in his youth: $hane o mac@DieselDevil88Joe Burrow is the kid from Home Alone btw. #CFBPlayoff2     ahmad black@ahmadblack35Joe Burrow be like.....13716 Seals Love@SealsLoveJoe Burrow hasn\'t been that dominant since he was Home Alone in New York. #joeburrow1 Dalto√±@daltine_crackerJoe Burrow played great in the Home Alone movies31     The Daily Advertiser, a newspaper in Lafayette, even wrote: One thing is certain: (Joe) Burrow had just as much fun scoring eight touchdowns Saturday against Oklahoma as Kevin McAllister defending his house against the Wet Bandits.

Eagles QB had humble beginnings before starring in Netflix\'s Quarterback  Marcus Mariota played for the Atlanta Falcons for a single season, but his performance wasn\'t good enough for them to keep him in the starting quarterback lineup. After one season, in which he made 13 starts and passed for 2,219 yards, 15 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions, the Falcons cut Mariota loose.  Marcus Mariota, who will play his ninth season in the league in 2023, has experienced a lot while playing for the Tennessee Titans, Las Vegas Raiders, Atlanta Falcons, and now the Philadelphia Eagles.        The newly acquired quarterback for the Eagles was taken in the first round of the NFL Draft, started games, filled in as a backup, battled through injuries, and was even cut. It goes without saying that he has a ton of league experience already, but let\'s go back and look at his background.           Honolulu, Hawaii, is where Marcus Mariota was born and brought up. He participated in football and track as a double-sport performer at St. Louis High School in Honolulu. Mariota played college football at the University of Oregon after graduating from high school.

', ""Marcus Mariota Eagles contract: How much will backup QB earn in Philadelphia?  Former Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota has signed a one-year, $5 million to be the backup QB for the Philadelphia Eagles.   The second pick of the 2015 draft will spend his ninth season with the Super Bowl LVII finalists and be a backup for Jalen Hurts. Mariota signed a one-year deal with $5 million, but reputed NFL insider Adam Schefter says that the contract could be up to $8 million with bonuses.        Mariota joins the Eagles after a brief stint with the Atlanta Falcons, as the Falcons released him after one year of a two-year deal. The move saved Atlanta about $12 million in salary cap space and imrpoved their financial flexibility heading into the free agency.            So, rather than be the QB1 on an NFL franchise, Mariota will act as a backup QB for the first time since 2021, when he was a backup to former Las Vegas QB Derek Carr.  Marcus Mariota's stats indicate Eagles have solid QB depth Marcus Mariota has been a decent but not spectacular player since his NFL debut in 2015.  He started his career with the Tennessee Titans, the team that drafted him, and he was a designated starter from day one. Mariota represented the Titans for five seasons, four of them as a starter. He put up 2,500+ passing yards per season, north of ten touchdowns and a league-average total of interceptions.      Mariota has put up a stat line of 15,656 passing yards, 92 touchdowns, and 54 interceptions in his NFL career. After he left the Titans in 2020, he has been up and around the league, serving as a backup and bridge QB at various franchises.  His stat line as an NFL player isn't poor, and he brings impressive depth to the QB position in Philadelphia. The other quarterback in the Eagles QB room is Notre Dame alum Ian Book, a fourth-round pick in the 2021 NFL draft. Book has not played much in the NFL, but his college performances show that he's no slouch.  How many NFL teams have Marcus Mariota played for? Marcus Mariota has played for three teams in the NFL before his upcoming stint with the Eagles.  Mariota entered the NFL with a lot of expectations, as NFL analysts expected him to be the next generational QB. His ground game was solid; his arm was dynamite, and he shone on a pretty average Oregon State University team. However, he has yet to live up to his undeniable potential, leaving much to be desired.     He was a member of the Titans for five seasons, the first five years of his NFL career. He then moved to the Las Vegas Raiders, where he stayed for two years before moving locations again. After his stint in Vegas, Mariota signed a two-year deal to become the starter at Atlanta Falcons. However, he only spent a season in Atlanta before he was cut during the 2023 off-season. Mariota signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles in the same off-season, becoming part of Nick Sirianni's offense.     "", ""Marcus Mariota or Carson Wentz: Best fantasy pick?  Yet another dilemma arises when you think about Marcus Mariota and Carson Wentz as fantasy picks. Who do you think can pull off some good points this weekend as the Atlanta Falcons and the Washington Commanders look to build points?  Mariota's team lost their first two games of the 2022 season (New Orleans Saints, 27-26 and Los Angeles Rams 31-27). They managed to grab a win in their latest meeting against the Seattle Seahawks (27-23).        The Commanders have seen a similar fate this season with two defeats in their first three games. In Week 1, they beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 28-22. In Week 2, they lost to the Detriot Lions 36-27. In Week 3, they lost to the Philadelphia Eagles, 24-8.           Marcus Mariota vs Carson Wentz: Key stats this season Atlanta Falcons v Seattle Seahawks  Marcus Mariota has been substantial right from the start of the season with stable individual performances thus far. The QB managed to register 215 passing yards in his first game against the New Orleans Saints.     Further, the 28-year-old covered 196 yards in his second game against the Los Angeles Rams. In the same battle, he also collected two touchdowns and two interceptions. Marcus grabbed 229 passing yards, one touchdown and one interception each when his team clashed against the Seahawks last weekend. Carson Wentz has 861 passing yards in total and seven touchdowns in his first three matches. The 29-year-old made a strong start this season with 313 passing yards, two interceptions and four TDs against the Jaguars. Philadelphia Eagles v Washington Commanders     Wentz went on to collect more passing yards in his next two games. He managed 337 yards, three touchdowns and one interception against the Detroit Lions. His recent encounter against the Eagles brought only 211 yards to his stats. How did Marcus Mariota and Carson Wentz perform last season? Since he's played fewer games, Mariota was nowhere near Wentz's overall fantasy points for the 2021-22 NFL season. Marcus racked up just 14.86 points across nine games for his former team, the Las Vegas Raiders. He averaged 1.7 fantasy points per game. Carson, however, was splendid throughout his 17 appearances for his former team, the Indianapolis Colts. He scored 258.02 fantasy points with an average of 15.2 points per game. Marcus Mariota vs Carson Wentz: Who should you pick for Week 4? Mariota has been attracting more attention from the Falcons with his ability to push the ball downfield, rushing yards, and red zone carries. With 640 passing yards already this season, he is a juicy pick for the fantasy team. In addition, he has 48.8 fantasy points so far.Carson showed a slower rate of performance in his last game against the Eagles' defense. Even if he has 64.14 points so far this season, we would recommend picking Marcus for Week 4.     "", ""NFL: 5 best replacements for Ben Roethlisberger at the Pittsburgh Steelers\xa0  Earlier during the offseason, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger restructured his contract to help with his team's cap situation.  In doing so, Roethlisberger also ensured he'll be returning to the fold in the Steel City come September 9th as the starting quarterback. But after 16 fantastic years in the NFL, it's hard to imagine that Roethlisberger has too many more championship-caliber years left in him.        Currently, Mason Rudolph is the Steelers' backup quarterback. If you happened to catch his 2019 performances when filling in for the injured Roethlisberger, then you'll already know they fell beneath the high standards expected in Pittsburgh.           The experience may have aided his progression. But, personally, I don't think Rudolph is the solution in the long term. This of course begs the question of who Roethlisberger's successor will eventually be? Let's take a look. Five potential replacements for Ben Roethlisberger The Steelers have signed Ben Roethlisberger to a new contract, per @RapSheet 24th highest-graded QB in 2020 (69.0) pic.twitter.com/DQMUUJ4mEK‚Äî PFF (@PFF) March 4, 2021     #1 - Marcus Mariota (Las Vegas Raiders) Marcus Mariota 2014 Heisman Award-winning QB Marcus Mariota has struggled to live up to expectations in his NFL career. In Tennessee, his abilities seemed to wane year on year and it was no surprise to see him moved on to the Las Vegas Raiders during the 2020 offseason. Mariota has been back up to Derek Carr ever since. That being said, there are two reasons why this signing could work for the Steelers. First, Mariota is out of contract at the end of the 2021 season and has enough experience under his belt to come in and do a job and second, in the one-game viewers really got to see off Mariota last season, he performed quite well.         This performance does suggest that coach Gruden's influence on one of the best college players of all time has been paying off. Besides which, if all else fails, Mariota can simply keep the passing game simple and hand the ball off to Najee Harris, who looks destined to have a tremendous career in the NFL. #2 - Carson Strong (Nevada)        Of all the quarterbacks I've seen this week in preparation for next year's 2022 NFL draft, the Nevada Wolf Pack's signal-caller Carson Strong is certainly the closest to Roethlisberger's style of play. He is potentially a college talent that the Steelers will keep an eye on. Like Roethlisberger, Strong is a traditional pocket-passer blessed with a gun of an arm, accurate delivery, and, at 6-foot-4, a real presence behind the line. Of course, the Steelers could vouch for a host of other quarterbacks in next year's draft. But with 5,193 yards, 38 TDs and just 11 picks in his first two campaigns as a starter in Nevada, Mike Tomlin and co. could do a lot worse than Carson Strong in their quest to replace Roethlisberger. #3 - Drew Lock or Teddy Bridgewater (Denver Broncos) Denver Broncos v Atlanta Falcons     With Drew Lock now vying with the former-Panther, Teddy Bridgewater, for quarterback supremacy in Denver. One of the two signal-callers will likely be deemed surplus to requirements come the 2022 offseason. Teddy Bridgewater threw for 3,733 passing yards, 15 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for Carolina in 2020. Drew Lock managed 2,933 passing yards, 16 touchdowns and 15 picks for the Broncos. With those stats, neither player is likely to pacify a Steelers fanbase used to watching such talents as Terry Bradshaw and Ben Roethlisberger at Heinz Field. But both would be decent stop-gap options if coach Tomlin and GM Kevin Colbert feel there isn't value for them in the 2022 NFL draft. #4 - Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers) Aaron Rodgers is reportedly not happy with the Packers and he has told the organization he does not want to return to the team, per @AdamSchefter Rodgers: PFF's highest-graded player in 2020 (95.1) pic.twitter.com/xTHVEAlZBF‚Äî PFF (@PFF) April 29, 2021     Aaron Rodgers wants out of Green Bay. The Pittsburgh Steelers franchise is one of the most renowned and storied in sports. If the quarterback is granted his wish, I'd expect to see the Steelers sniffing around for the 2020 NFL MVP and the quarterback reciprocating the interest. It probably won't happen, but the Steelers have as good a chance as any other team of persuading Rodgers to join their ranks and, of course, he'd be an excellent replacement for Roethlisberger. #5 - Mitchell Trubisky (Buffalo Bills) Mitchell Trubisky: 63.5 PFF Grade in 2020T-32nd among QBs pic.twitter.com/6eOYBFqsJ6‚Äî PFF (@PFF) March 18, 2021     Bear with me here. For all the hate he receives for not being Patrick Mahomes, Mitchell Trubisky has still thrown almost twice as many touchdowns as he has interceptions in his short career. He's been to the playoffs twice and he's young enough to improve further whilst learning a more dynamic style of offense under Sean McDermott and Brian Daboll at the Bills training center. And who knows what kind of tricks he'll pick up from Josh Allen over in Buffalo, too. Like my first pick Marcus Mariota, I just don't think Trubisky is over and done with in the NFL just yet. Someone will give him another opportunity, so why not the Steelers next year if Roethlisberger retires?Trubisky lining up alongside RB Najee Harris, WRs JuJu Smith-Schuster, Chase Claypool and Diontae Johnson doesn't sound all that bad to me.Plus, it's not like Roethlisberger didn't have a nightmare season back in 2006 (18 touchdowns, 23 interceptions). Players can improve, and Trubisky deserves another shot.     Also Read: Who is Ben Roethlisberger's Wife, Ashley Harlan?      "", ""Kyle Pitts fantasy outlook: Should you drop him?  One of the most prominent fantasy disappointments thus far this year has been Kyle Pitts. Most attribute his shortage of output to quarterback Marcus Mariota's subpar performance and Arthur Smith's play-calling. Nevertheless, Pitts has not yet paid off for fantasy managers this year.  Pitts maintained his start-of-the-season troubles in the last game he played, catching just one of four passes for 25 yards. However, even if his form continues, his output might still be the result of strategy rather than talent.

The tight end seems prepared to make his one-game absence come to an end when he returns against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 6.  Unfortunately, his contribution has been underwhelming up to this point in the year, with the exception of a strong Week 3 effort against the Seattle Seahawks.     Pitts has caught only 10 of 22 targets for 150 yards through four matches this season, giving his fantasy owners 15 points. Dave Kluge@DaveKlugeAssuming he plays, Kyle Pitts is my TE3 this week. The production hasn't been there but there are indicators for a bounceback.His 23.7% target share ranks 3rd among all tight ends. He's 2nd in air yards and air yards share. His 15.1 aDoT ranks as the league's best.Be patient.471 In terms of performance, he has only had one match this season where he has recorded more than three PPR points and has yet to score a touchdown.  He might not be an extremely useful fantasy option against San Francisco in Week 6 as the 49ers have allowed the third-fewest fantasy points to opposing TEs this year. Pitts might yet again be prevented from reaching the end zone as no tight end has scored against San Francisco in through five weeks.      Should you drop Kyle Pitts? Kyle Pitts should not be dropped at this time under any circumstances. It likely took a high pick in the draft to acquire the Falcons tight end, so turning back now would not be logical.  His 2022 production's preliminary results are undoubtedly underwhelming. Still, he possesses the skills to be among the finest in his position this season. If you have him in your squad, retain him and use him frequently because he can explode if the Atlanta Falcons' offense starts to gel. Michael Rothstein@mikerothsteinFalcons TE Kyle Pitts said he expects to play Sunday.82472Trading Kyle Pitts right now would be merely a short-term benefit strategy. You'd be trading at a loss, and there's a good chance that his long-term rebound is unavoidable. Pitts has a ton of real-life trade potential and might be sold because he doesn't match the Falcons' preferred style of play.     "", ""Which QBs would star in college version of Quarterback Netflix? Top 5 options for streaming giant to consider, including Caleb Williams & Drake Maye  The Netflix series titled 'Quarterback,' which released on July 12, 2023, has drawn plenty of interest from football fans leading up to its debut. The series features Patrick Mahomes, Kirk Cousins and Marcus Mariota, of the Kansas City Chiefs, Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Falcons, respectively.  Each of the players wore a microphone for each game of the 2022 season, giving fans a never before seen look at NFL quarterbacks. While Mahomes led the Chiefs to a Super Bowl and won his second MVP award, Cousins led the Vikings to an NFC North title.         Mariota's Falcons struggled and he was replaced by rookie Desmond Ridder for the final four games of the season.      With the series set to premiere, take a look at five collegiate quarterbacks who would star in such a series.  #1 USC Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams Caleb Williams is the obvious choice here as he is coming off of a season in which he won the Heisman Trophy. The USC Trojans star is looking to become the second player in NCAA history, and first since Archie Griffin in the mid-1970s, to win the award twice. While that storyline alone would make Williams a compelling choice for the series, his performance is what truly warrants his inclusion. The projected first overall pick of the 2024 NFL Draft threw for 4537 yards, 42 touchdowns and five interceptions.  He also completed 66.6% of his passes while adding 382 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns.  #2 North Carolina Tar Heels quarterback Drake Maye     Drake Maye is projected to be the second overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. He threw for 4321 yards, 38 touchdowns and seven interceptions this past season. Maye also completed 66.2% of his passes while adding 698 rushing yards and seven touchdowns.  While he does not have the starpower of Caleb Williams, appearing on such a show would allow fans to become more familiar with Maye.  #3 Texas Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers Quinn Ewers was the top-ranked overall prospect in the 2021 recruiting class and one of just three quarterbacks to receive a perfect 247 Sports recruiting grade. Ewers threw for 2177 yards, 15 touchdowns and six interceptions while completing 58.1% of his passes. He is a candidate to take a major leap this season and has the third-best Heisman odds. Furthermore, his inclusion would give fans a sneak peek at Arch Manning, who would likely be the star of a second season when he takes over as a starter.      #4 Notre Dame Fighting Irish quarterback Sam Hartman Sam Hartman has already starred on a Netflix show as he appeared in season two of 'QB1: Beyond the Lights.'  He has had back-to-back strong seasons in which he combined for 7929 passing yards, 77 touchdowns and 26 interceptions. Hartman completed 60.8% of his passes while adding 493 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns. He joined the Notre Dame Fighting Irish via the transfer portal after five years with the Wake Forest Demon Deacons. Playing for one of the biggest programs in college football, combined with his previous appearance on Netflix, would make Hartman a great fit.  #5 South Carolina Gamecocks quarterback Spencer Rattler Spencer Rattler is another player who appeared on 'QB1: Beyond the Lights,' having been included in the third season of the series. He has had an up-and-down college career and threw for 3026 yards, 18 touchdowns and 12 interceptions while completing 66.2% of his passes last season.Rattler play a role similar to that of Marcus Mariota on this hypothetican series as a veteran who hasn't quite lived up to expectations and is looking to get back on track.

Well, it turns out it didn\'t disappoint, and Sharpe was left impressed with how Mahomes went about his business. Sharpe wrote on his Instagram page: ‚ÄúAttended the premiere of Quarterback last nite. I left having a better understanding of what makes Patrick Mahomes tick. After watching 1st episode. Mahomeboy will become your fav qb. He\'s MOFO BEAST.‚Äù      Most NFL fans only see what happens on a Sunday or Monday night as players showcase their abilities to millions on TV or at the stadium. But what ""Quarterback"" does is take them behind the scenes and delves into what goes into a professional football player\'s life. It makes for great viewing, and after seeing Mahomes in the first episode, we can\'t wait for the others.  Can Patrick Mahomes and Chiefs go back-to-back? Kansas City Chiefs\' victory parade     In an ideal world for the Chiefs, winning back-to-back Super Bowls is the plan, but in professional sports, things rarely go to plan. With Patrick Mahomes fresh off winning his second Super Bowl ring, no doubt the fire still burns to get another.    Whether or not that is this year is up for debate, but the quarterback has another great chance at repeating if things go the Chiefs\' way. Of course, the AFC is absolutely stacked with talent, so the Chiefs making it to the Super Bowl is going to be tough.        The AFC West is also a tough division, with the Los Angeles Chargers, Denver Broncos and Las Vegas Raiders calling it home as well. Justin Herbert and the Chargers are there or there about, the Broncos under Sean Payton will no doubt improve and noone is sure what the Raiders will be in 2023.But everyone is gunning for Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs in 2023, and if they can\'t stop the Kanas City juggernaut, then Super Bowl No. 3 might just be around the corner.     ', 'Quarterback on Netflix: Everything we know so far about the NFL series  After a series of ambitious projects, Netflix is now partnering with NFL to produce the sports docuseries Quarterback, which will give an in-depth and detailed look at the famous sport. In addition to providing unprecedented access to the sport and all its nuanced complexities, the sports documentary series will feature commentary from renowned quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes, Kirk Cousins, and Marcus Mariota.

McCarron after former Bengals QB delivers MVP-esque performance in XFL - ‚ÄúWould‚Äôve been better than Dalton""  There have been many detractors of the XFL, but for former NFL quarterback A.J. McCarron, he is putting his best foot forward in showing people how good the league can be.  In what was one of the best XFL performances in its history, McCarron put on a show for the St.Louis Battlehawks against the Orlando Guardians. McCarron completed 28 of his 35 passes for 420 yards and six touchdowns in the 53-28 rout of Orlando.

', ""NFL Training Camp 2021: 5 Cincinnati Bengals players on the roster bubble heading into training camp  Being the only team in the AFC North to not have a winning record in 2020 is something the Cincinnati Bengals want to fix. Rookie quarterback Joe Burrow showed a lot of promise before going down with a knee injury mid-season.   The Bengals also used the 2021 draft as a way to reinforce other positions on the active roster. So who will see themselves on the outside of the final roster cut at the end of preseason play?                   5 Cincinnati Bengals players on the roster bubble  #5 - Brandon Allen, QB The Bengals have found their franchise quarterback in Joe Burrow. Training camp is going to be the telling sign as to who will sit behind Burrow on the depth chart. With pre-season games scheduled this year, unlike in 2020, there will actually be a quarterback competition for the depth chart. Quarterbacks Kyle Shurmur and Eric Dungey are both on the roster and could be reliable options to serve as backup to Burrow.  #4 - Darius Phillips, CB The offseason signings of Mike Hilton and Eli Apple have both hindered the chances of Darius Phillips making the roster at the end of training camp. Considering he hasn't been able to get more playing time before those signings, he is unlikely to have an opportunity to make a name for himself this summer either. The #Bengals aren‚Äôt done. They‚Äôre signing former #Steelers CB Mike Hilton, source said.‚Äî Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) March 16, 2021      #3 - Billy Price, C One of the Bengals' main priorities has been to protect their franchise quarterback Joe Burrow. Last season, Burrow didn't get enough protection from the offensive line and went down with a severe knee injury. In the offseason, the Bengals have used the draft and free agency to make improvements to the line. With that being said, Billy Price hasn't shown enough as of late to prove he is a starter leading the Bengals to not pick up a fifth-year option on his contract. This means he will be a free agent at the end of the season.   #2 - Austin Seibert, K Kicker Austin Seibert will be competing for the placekicker job against fifth-round draft pick Evan McPherson. The Bengals clearly weren't thrilled with Seibert's performance in 2020 and they decided to use a fifth-round draft pick on a kicker. Seibert's career field goal percentage is slightly over 80%.  #1 - Mason Schreck, TE     A former seventh-round draft pick, Mason Schrek has spent most of his career on the Bengals' practice squad. However, he has shown a lot of promise in the time he has gotten on the field. The Bengals now have Burrow's LSU teammate Thaddeus Moss, Mitchell Wilcox and C.J. Uzomah all competing for the tight-end starting job.Who are the offensive sleepers to know at Cincinnati Bengals training camp? https://t.co/8bbr8YdIUf‚Äî The Bengals Wire (@TheBengalsWire) June 28, 2021     "", 'NFL Power Rankings: AFC North, Week 13  For the AFC North, it feels like Week 12 of this NFL season ended right when Week 13 was getting started.  That\'s because the marquee matchup of last week in the division -- originally scheduled for Thanksgiving Thursday -- didn\'t happen until Wednesday of this week. The Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers were delayed by COVID-19 and bad weather, but finally got their Week 12 game played six days later.        The Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals played their games last Sunday without a hitch.           In Week 13, the Steelers have a short turnaround with a ""Monday Night Football"" game, while the Ravens\' game originally scheduled for this Thursday has been pushed back by the NFL to Tuesday. Here\'s how the AFC North teams stack up entering Week 13 of the NFL schedule.  4. Cincinnati Bengals (2-8-1) Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green In their first full game without Joe Burrow, the Bengals put 17 points on the board with backup quarterback Brandon Allen, losing 19-17 to the New York Giants.     The Bengals were also playing without No. 1 running back Joe Mixon, who\'s on the IR with a foot injury. The team doesn\'t have their best QB, RB and their most talented receiver (A.J. Green) has been unproductive all season. That\'s not a good formula for winning in the NFL. It\'s hard to see another win on the schedule for the Bengals the rest of the season, even with the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans on the list. This week, the Bengals travel to Miami to play the 7-4 Dolphins. Fifth TD on the season for @teehiggins5!üì∫: #NYGvsCIN on FOX pic.twitter.com/qP1vMPsKnG‚Äî Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) November 29, 2020      3. Baltimore Ravens (6-5) Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh When the Ravens were finally able to take the field and play the Steelers on Wednesday, they did it while significantly short-handed. Starting QB Lamar Jackson, the reigning NFL MVP, was sidelined with COVID-19. So were running backs Mark Ingram II and J.K. Dobbins, defensive end Calais Campbell, and linebacker Pernell McPhee. To make matters worse, cornerback Jimmy Smith left the game in the first half with a groin injury. Baltimore would lose the game, 19-14.     Robert Griffin III started at QB, but he was largely ineffective. Third-stringer Trace McSorley looked better than RG3 in limited action. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh has not said whether Jackson will return when the Ravens face the Dallas Cowboys on Tuesday in Week 13. If Jackson doesn\'t play, will McSorley start, or Griffin?  2. Cleveland Browns (8-3) Cleveland Browns RB Nick Chubb It doesn\'t sound like a big deal, but Cleveland Browns fans are excited that their team has clinched its first non-losing season since 2007. Sunday\'s 27-25 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars gave the Browns their eighth win of the season, ensuring that, at worst, Cleveland will finish with an even-.500 record.     More likely, the Browns will finish with a winning record and possibly get into the NFL playoffs for the first time since the 2002 NFL season. They\'re doing it on the strength of running backs Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt, and the defense. Quarterback Baker Mayfield has been efficient, which is better than the erratic performances he had last season. The Browns play the Tennessee Titans this week on the road, facing another NFL team that relies on its running game and defense to win. .@joethomas73 goes in-depth to explain how Nick Chubb is able to pick up so many big runs within the offense in this week\'s ""Cup of Joe""‚òïÔ∏è ¬ª https://t.co/SDmVLZVSCj pic.twitter.com/nSjV1pPR5s‚Äî Cleveland Browns (@Browns) December 3, 2020      1. Pittsburgh Steelers (11-0) No surprise who tops this power ranking. The Steelers are the NFL\'s only undefeated team this season, improving to 11-0 after beating the Ravens 19-14 on Wednesday. The Steelers have a short turnaround, facing Washington on ""Monday Night Football"" in the NFL\'s Week 13. Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger admitted in his postgame interview that Pittsburgh did not play well against Baltimore. He threw for 266 yards, one touchdown and one interception. Running back Benny Snell, filling in for James Conner (COVID-19), rushed for 60 yards on 16 carries.The Steelers will look to get their playmakers back on track in Week 13. Receivers JuJu Smith-Schuster and Chase Claypool each averaged less than 10 yards per catch in the Baltimore game.     ', ""Broncos QBs since Peyton Manning: Every starter since Hall of Famer retired in 2016  Ever since Peyton Manning retired in 2016, after winning his second Super Bowl overall and his first with the Denver Broncos, the franchise has gone through upheaval every year at the quarterback position. It is a notoriously difficult place to fill at the best of times, but it is especially difficult when someone is trying to replace an all-time great like Peyton Manning.  We take a look at every starter who has played for the Denver Broncos in that position since Peyton Manning's retirement. As this has been such an unstable position for the franchise after Peyton Manning, in most seasons, they have had multiple starters in the given position. So, for the purposes of clarity, only those who started most games are listed at the top and others who played in those seasons are mentioned separately.                       Denver Broncos quarterbacks since Peyton Manning retired 2016 and 2017 - Trevor Siemian Right after Peyton Manning retired, Brock Osweiler, who had started some of the games the previous year with Peyton Manning in their Super Bowl-winning season, left for the Houston Texans to become their starter. That opened up the field for third-choice Trevor Siemian to compete with rookie Paxton Lynch and veteran Mark Sanchez, and Siemian eventually became the starter.     James Palmer@JamesPalmerTVTrevor Siemian is the only QB with a winning record for the #Broncos since Peyton Manning retired entering the 2016 seasonTrevor Siemian (13-11), Case Keenum (6-10), Paxton Lynch (1-3), Joe Flacco (0-4) and Brock Osweiler (0-4)35588 In 2016, he played 14 of 16 games for the Denver Broncos (the last two weeks were quarterbacked by Paxton Lynch) and established himself as the first choice. Even though the Broncos missed the playoffs, he finished with a passer rating of 84.6 that was higher than Peyton Manning and Brock Osweiler from the previous season. Over the last six weeks of his season from Weeks 8 to 14, he averaged more than 300 yards, behind only Tom Brady and Kirk Cousins. He was named a Pro Bowl alternate but did not accept the invitation due to the shoulder surgery he went ahead with after Week 14.        In 2017, now firmly established as a starter but under new coach Vance Joseph, he began the season strongly, and the high point was a game against the Dallas Cowboys where he threw four touchdowns. In Week 6, he suffered a shoulder injury. Then, over the next few weeks, his production declined. He was benched in favor of the returning Brock Osweiler in Week 9, who was himself then relieved by Paxton Lynch in Week 12. After Lynch was injured in that game, Siemian got another chance to lead the Broncos. But another shoulder injury in Week 15 spelled the end of his career with the Broncos as Brock Osweiler relieved him in that game and started in Week 16.     2018 - Case Keenum After the upheaval of the previous season, when the Broncos had three quarterbacks trading places, head coach Vance Joseph chose to reunite with former Houston Texans quarterback Case Keenum, who they traded from the Minnesota Vikings. They stuck with him throughout the season and he started all 16 games as the Broncos went 6-10.    He threw for 3,890 yards with a 62.3 completion rate. He had 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, with a 81.2 passer rating. He was traded to the Washington Redskins for a seventh-round pick in 2019.     2019 - Joe Flacco In 2019, the Denver Broncos decided to go with Joe Flacco, who had won one Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens. There were eerie parallels with Peyton Manning as they plumped for a veteran quarterback and former Super Bowl MVP. He was named the starter and had the job until he faced a neck injury in Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts. In those eight games that he started, he had 1,822 passing yards, six touchdowns, five interceptions, and an 85.1 passer rating. He was subsequently released by the Broncos and went on to sign with the New York Jets, where he still is currently.        After Joe Flacco was injured, he was replaced by Brandon Allen for three games before Drew Lock stepped in for the final five games of the season. The rookie quarterback finished with 1,020 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions in those five games and equalled John Elway's franchise record for most wins by a rookie in Broncos history. His four wins came in just five games compared to the 10 taken by Elway. Peter Baugh@Peter_BaughDrew Lock's rookie year stats for the #Broncos: ‚Ä¢5 games played ‚Ä¢1,020 yards (204 a game)‚Ä¢7 TD‚Ä¢3 interceptions ‚Ä¢4-1 record776 2020 - Drew Lock For his performances the previous season, Lock was named the starter for 2020. In Week 2, he injured his shoulder and would not return until Week 6. During that period, Jeff Driskel and Brett Rypien started one game each. In Week 12, due to a COVID outbreak among the quarterback corps, running back Phillip Lindsay started under center.     Lock's performances in his second season were not up to standard. Case in point, he had 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. This was the joint highest in the league , tied with Carson Wentz, despite Lock only playing 13 matches. His 57.3 completion rate was the lowest among all quarterbacks with, at least, 150 passing attempts that season.    2021 - Teddy Bridgewater In 2021, Teddy Bridgewater, the 2015 Pro Bowler, joined the team from the Carolina Panthers. He beat out Drew Lock to become the starter, though Lock started three games in each of which Bridgewater was out injured. In the 13 games that he started, he threw for 3,052 yards, 18 touchdowns, and seven interceptions for a passer rating of 94.9 with a 66.9 completion percentage. At the end of the season, he was traded to the Miami Dolphins as the Denver Broncos acquired Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks.     2022 - Russell Wilson   Russell Wilson joined from the Seattle Seahawks. In a deal that sent Drew Lock to Seattle, along with other players and draft picks, the future hall-of-famer joined the Denver Broncos for a five-year, $245 million deal. The Broncos will hope to replicate the success they had with Peyton Manning when they last had a future hall-of-famer as their quarterback.     ""]"

Deshaun Watson shines in Browns\' win over Commanders While LeBron James\' tweet supporting Deshaun Watson may have been ill-advised, the Cleveland Browns quarterback did have his best performance for the team against the Washington Commanders on Sunday. Watson completed nine of his 18 pass attempts for 169 yards and three touchdowns and rushed for another 31 yards on eight carries.

In the meantime, he will spend time with his team and get the support of his girlfriend, Jilly Anais.  Anais recently posted stories to her Instagram account. She and a group of friends were in a suite at FirstEnergy Stadium this past weekend. They watched as the Cleveland Browns faced the Philadelphia Eagles in their second preseason game.        Anais posted a video of her and the rest of the group toasting their glasses and yelling, ""Cheers, ladies.""           Jilly Anais toasting with her friends at the Cleveland Browns vs Philadelphia Eagles preseason game (via Jilly Anais\' Instagram Stories) She also posted other selfies from the suite during the game. This isn\'t the first time that Anais has been seen supporting her boyfriend this summer. She was also seen on the sidelines during training camp practice, cheering for the quarterback. Anais has been in the stands, rooting for the Cleveland Browns\' quarterback since last year, when the allegations first came to light.     Jilly Anais celebrating with friends (via Jilly Anais\' Instagram Stories) Watson\'s suspension will officially begin on August 30, 2022, after the team\'s third and final preseason game.

View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     His disciplinary action from the National Football League will then officially begin. He will then be prohibited from entering the Browns\' facilities until October 10. At that point, the quarterback will be allowed to do light practices and meetings with the team, but full participation won\'t be allowed until November 14, 2022, which will give him and the team two weeks to prepare for his season debut in Week 13. Who is Deshaun Watson\'s girlfriend Jilly Anais? Jilly Anais (from her Instagram page, photo by Cassidy Sparrow)     Since the allegations against Deshaun Watson have made headlines and sparked conversation, his girlfriend Jilly Anais has continued to stand by him, showing that she supports his declarations of innocence.

', 'Kevin Stefanski delivers update on Deshaun Watson after Browns\' QB‚Äôs disappointing season  Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson is coming off a disappointing season. He played only six games last season due to his suspension, and in those games, the Browns quarterback looked rusty.  Watson\'s dip in performance was predictable since he was away from the game for a long time, but the quarterback would love to get back to how he played with the Houston Texans.        Watson has put in a lot of work during the offseason, and according to his head coach, Kevin Stefanski he is looking pretty good in the OTAs. Here\'s what he said about his quarterback:           ""He\'s done a really nice job throughout this entire offseason of being diligent about understanding playbook, understanding his teammates every single day."" ""There are always going to be things that you want to get back and do a little bit differently."" He said. ""That\'s no different than every player at every position, but he\'s right where he needs to be."" In six games that he played last season, Watson had a passer rating of 79.1 with 1,102 yards, seven touchdowns, and five interceptions. This output was extremely disappointing considering how much the Cleveland Browns spent to acquire him. Hopefully, Watson will be able to rediscover himself next season, as he has got a full offseason to work with the franchise in full capacity, unlike last season.      Deshaun Watson is looking to reunite with DeAndre Hopkins Deshaun Watson and DeAndre Hopkins: Houston Texans v Tampa Bay Buccaneers DeAndre Hopkins was released by the Arizona Cardinals last week. He is now a free agent and multiple teams are interested in him. Deshaun Watson has also shown interest in playing with Hopkins, and the possibility of a reunion of the two is open. Watson played with Hopkins for the Houston Texans, and they were among the best QB-WR duos during that time. They made each other better, which is why this move would make a lot of sense for both parties.     While playing with Hopkins in Houston, Watson had a passer rating of 101.0 with 9,716 yards, 71 touchdowns, and 29 interceptions in 38 games. These numbers show how great the pairing could be in Cleveland, which is why the franchise should look to aggressively pursue the former Cardinals receiver.If the Browns manage to sign Hopkins, there will be no denying their status as a legitimate Super Bowl contender in the upcoming season.     ', 'Diet and Workout Routine of NFL Star Deshaun Watson  Deshaun Watson was born on September 14, 1995 and plays American football with the National Football League team Cleveland Browns (NFL).   In 2016, he led his Clemson college football team to the national championship. The Houston Texans had selected Watson in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft before he moved to the Browns this year.        Watson\'s debut season was cut short by injuries, but he guided the Texans to consecutive division victories in 2018 and 2019. He led the league in passing yards in 2020. He was also selected for the Pro Bowl in each of his last three seasons as the starting quarterback for Houston. He has the highest average performance across career completions (minimum 1,500 tries). Watson takes a lot of care to maintain his physique and watches his diet too. On that note, here\'s a look at his workout routine and diet plan.         Deshaun Watson\'s Workout Routine Deshaun Watson works hard in the offseason to remain in top physical condition to assist the Texans on the field. In college at Clemson, he demonstrated his power with 605-pound deadlifts. Since then, he has maintained his strength while focusing on cardio and flexibility and avoiding injury. Core-strengthening exercises are his preferred way of exercise. Watson says that people in general are unaware that the core regulates and guides the entire body. ""Because I perform on the field with advanced training and strength, a strong core is a must. It also helps deflate the risk of injury,"" he once said.        Watson works out four days a week, including two hours in the weight room and one hour on the field, for three hours in total. Depending on the day, he alternates between lower body, upper body, and core workouts. His favorite is probably lower body workouts. He also does a lot of flexibility work and stretching. That\'s his fitness regimen. He\'s also extremely consistent with his workouts and trains specifically for his sport. Now, let\'s find out his eating plan to comprehend how he fuels himself so effectively:  Deshaun Watson\'s Diet Deshaun Watson, who was raised in the south, craves fast food and sweet tea, which he has had to eliminate from his diet. Now, according to his diet philosophy, convenience and protein are paramount. Watson says that he now consumes a \'Just Crack an Egg\' breakfast dish every morning. In the afternoon, he consumes lean protein, some carbs, and magnesium-rich leafy greens. Throughout the day, he snacks on fruit and granola. He also looks to replicate his lunch for supper by ingesting a high-protein, omega fatty acid-rich meal to aid in his recovery.        Watson\'s diet is very consistent, and he prefers to keep it on the healthier end of the spectrum. He also has homemade, protein-rich dishes as much as possible so that he can achieve excellent muscular growth, which is a win-win for him.  Takeaway To maintain his level of play, Deshaun Watson consistently works on his body and physical condition.He follows a basic workout and diet routine, performing core-focused exercises and workouts. He also consumes home-made healthy meals full of protein, healthy fats, and some carbs. This combination helps him be at the top of his game.Don\'t be afraid to experiment, and try out what works out well for you.

Jacoby Brissett, the now quarterback of the Washington Commanders, played in the first 11 games in Watson's place. ‚ÄúI think where he is right now, hard to compare to a year ago, but I certainly see a comfort level in what we‚Äôre doing offensively.

"", 'Redditors shocked over Deshaun Watson\'s 11-game suspension  Deshaun Watson was initially given a six-game suspension but the NFL appealed the ruling. Five more games were added to the Cleveland Browns quarterback‚Äôs suspension, making it 11 games and a five million-dollar fine. This followed an NFL investigation into 24 accusations of sexual misconduct levied against Watson.  Some NFL fans are not too happy about the suspension and the fine as a ruling. Redditors shared their thoughts on the quarterback and the ruling itself.        Some on Reddit went after the Browns quarterback for his actions in their response to the ruling, saying he\'s a predator:              Warning: NSFW language         Warning: NSFW language                 Other Redditors placed the blame squarely on the league for the Cleveland quarterback\'s suspension and discussed his apology:                     Tony Buzbee, the attorney for the plaintiffs, shared his disapproval of the ruling, saying: ‚ÄúBy settling this matter the way he has, Roger Goodell has proven one of two things: either his recent rhetoric was utter baloney, or his bark is much worse than his bite."" Jake Trotter@Jake_TrotterStatement from Tony Buzbee, the attorney for the women who sued Watson:36078     After the 11-game suspension came out, Deshaun Watson spoke to the media. He said that he\'s innocent, but wants to push forward with his career: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been able to stand on my innocence and always said I never assaulted or disrespected anyone but at the same point I have to continue to push forward with my life and career.‚Äù    However, he said in an interview before the 11-game suspension was revealed that he was sorry to the women impacted:     ""I want to say that I\'m truly sorry to all of the women that I have impacted in this situation.""    The quarterback added that his decisions placed him in the position he was in: ""The decisions that I made in my life that put me in this position I would definitely like to have back. But I want to continue to move forward and grow and learn and show that I am a true person of character and I am going to keep pushing forward.""     It seems the 26-year-old apologized and maintained his innocence within a span of days. Watson was accused by over two dozen women who accused him of sexual assault and sexual harassment during massage sessions. Now that we know that he\'ll be playing this season, attention is now focused on his return in Week 13.  Deshaun Watson returns to the Cleveland Browns in Week 13 against the Houston Texans Deshaun Watson at Cleveland Browns Training Camp     Remarkably, Deshaun Watson will return in Week 13 against his former team, the Houston Texans. The question is whether the Browns will still be in playoff contention by that point. They are set to start Jacoby Brissett for the duration of Watson\'s suspension. He will be backed up by Josh Rosen and Joshua Dobbs. Brissett is definitely good enough to win a few games for the Browns, who will likely lean heavily on their running game. To have any chance of making the postseason, they will need Brissett to win at least six games. From there, Watson will have to hit the ground running upon his return. Watson had a poor performance in his preseason debut against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He completed one pass for seven yards from five attempts. It will be interesting to see if so much time away from the field will be an issue for him when he returns.

', ""Deshaun Watson still leaves a lot wanting despite Browns securing crucial win against Ravens  Deshaun Watson made his long-awaited home debut on Saturday in the best possible fashion. He helped lead the Cleveland Browns to a win to improve to 6-8 on the year and keep the slim playoff hopes alive.  Yet the 13-3 victory did not exactly feature a legendary performance from the quarterback. He finished 18/28 for 161 yards and threw for the only touchdown in the game. The defense was the reason the Browns cruised to victory, which is a rare fact to type out this season.        Cleveland is now 2-1 with Watson under center. However, fans are still waiting for him to live up to the hype of his $230 million deal.           Fans are waiting for Deshaun Watson to arrive Baltimore Ravens v Cleveland Browns Browns fans continue to hear the same facts, or excuses, about the new franchise signal-caller. He was off for nearly two full years and had to return this season in Week 13, without a traditional preseason to ramp up to full-game speed. He also made his return on the road against his former team in the Houston Texans.     Cleveland Browns@BrownsFirst home win feels @deshaunwatson | #Browns1863323 Saturday marked his first home game, and his stats actually went down from last week's loss against the Cincinnati Bengals. Yet the weather was freezing, and most importantly, he did not turn the ball over like he did in his first two games back. Just getting wins will endear him to the fanbase at this point. The problem is that below-average performances from him could mean another losing record if this carries over into 2023. Jacoby Brissett provided admirable quarterback play in the first 11 games of the year, and because of defensive woes, the team had a 4-7 record.     If the defense does not improve, Watson may have to play at a Pro Bowl level just to have the Browns in contention in the division. And that is assuming a return to that level of play is still possible for him after his long absence. The 11-game suspension meant the entire organization began focusing on 2023, with 2022 as an evaluation period for the entire roster. They would have taken a playoff berth if it came, but firings won't be happening because they miss out. Baillie Burmaster@bayburmTV#Browns QB Deshaun Watson‚Äôs first start ends in a W444A win over the Ravens gives fans optimism heading into the holiday season for what Watson can do next. But if he fails to bump up his stats next week, even in a win, fans may be wondering if he will ever live up to the hype in Cleveland.     "", 'NFL analyst reveals why sun might be rising on Deshaun Watson after controversy-soaked opening to 2020s  Deshaun Watson will enter the 2023 NFL season with massive expectations considering how much the Cleveland Browns invested in him. They surrendered draft capital and signed Watson to the largest fully-guaranteed contract in NFL history last year, despite him being suspended for the first 11 games of the 2022 season.  The aggressive move by the Browns likely shows that they believe Deshaun Watson is capable of elevating them to become Super Bowl contenders. While many around the NFL may not think so highly of their chances, Sara Walsh recently appeared on Good Morning Football to discuss why she thinks their 2022 results are encouraging for their 2023 outlook.        Here\'s what Walsh had to say:           ""Seven wins. Take those seven wins over to another division in the NFC South and you\'re one game out on winning the division. I mean the NFC South sort of skews everything, but yeah I think we\'re not talking enough about how this wasn\'t a two win team a year ago. This was a seven win team, and to that point it was sort of quietly seven wins, right? ""So let\'s go back a year prior. The Jaguars, who everyone\'s hot on and they walk into the postseason last year, they had three wins that year before. The Giants had four wins that year before. This is a seven wins Browns team that had a lot of controversy, that\'s got a quarterback that was just trying to get his feet back into the NFL and get settled.""     Walsh added:  ""I think it\'s a completely different story this year. And again, I\'m not saying that that means that they\'re the favorites, and they\'ve got Joe Burrow and Lamar to contend with. But I think overall, I think they\'re really quietly, if that\'s possible, in a really good position that they\'re not being talked about."" Good Morning Football@gmfb""This wasn\'t a 2 win team a year ago, this was a 7 win team..."" Should we be talking more about the 2023 Browns?@Sara_Walsh6715 While the Browns finished in last place in the AFC North division last year, they were only two games shy of making an appearance in the NFL Playoffs. Making this even more impressive is that they did so with Jacoby Brissett as their primary quarterback for most of the year. With Deshaun Watson ready to go for Week 1 this year, the Browns may be ready to take a step forward in the 2023 NFL season.       Deshaun Watson\'s last full NFL season Deshaun Watson The last time Deshaun Watson played a full NFL season was in 2020 when he was still a member of the Houston Texans. All he did was lead the entire NFL with 4,823 passing yards. He also ranked among the top five quarterbacks with 33 touchdowns passes and an impressive 112.4 passer rating. His elite performance is a big reason why the Browns went all-in to acquire him, despite the controversies off of the field.     ', 'Report reveals Browns player was unhappy with Baker Mayfield\'s poor performance in training  Baker Mayfield is currently facing a battle for his NFL future, which lies in limbo. He remains on the Cleveland Browns\' roster despite the franchise making it abundantly clear they will be moving forward with Deshaun Watson as their starting quarterback.  A recent report has questioned Mayfield\'s ability and that he was regularly poor in practice, according to an unnamed Browns player. The information contained a quote from a Browns player. The statement addresses a video Odell Beckham Jr.\'s father released on social media in November last year, showing the quarterback not throwing the ball to his son, who was open on several occasions.                View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post           According to the report, when asked if he had seen the video posted by Beckham Jr.\'s father, the unnamed Browns player gave a scathing response. He said: ""Why would I watch the video? I see it every day in practice."" Offseason Chopz@Pchopz_Oh boy.3417478     This is another negative view that could hinder Mayfield\'s search for a new team. With the NFL Draft ending, the chance for the Browns to move him on to pastures new and focus on the future with a different quarterback have also diminished. The Carolina Panthers were interested in Mayfield, but recent reports have shown that they were never close to a deal with the Browns. The Panthers went on to draft Matt Corral, who will challenge Sam Darnold for the starting job in Charlotte.        Other potential teams that needed a quarterback have made moves to find the piece to the puzzle, with the Pittsburgh Steelers drafting Kenny Pickett and the Seattle Seahawks set to move forward with Drew Lock behind center. Seattle head coach Pete Carroll recently stated that the Seahawks weren\'t looking to add another quarterback \'at all\' to their roster, which puts an end to Seattle being a possible destination for Mayfield.  Why are teams reluctant to make a trade for Baker Mayfield? One of the main hurdles is the quarterback\'s $19 million salary due in 2022. Teams seem reluctant to take on that amount, which reportedly led to the Panthers\' and Browns\' inability to agree on trade terms.   It also seems highly unlikely that Mayfield will stay and offer back-up for Watson as he sees himself as the starting quarterback. Based on the NFL Index quarterback rankings, he ranked 25th out of 62 quarterbacks, with his inconsistency proving to be a significant shortcoming.     ']"

31,Taylor Heinicke,"['NFL Rumors: Washington Commanders make big decision regarding franchise\'s future  The Washington Commanders have officially made a change. After Carson Wentz went down, Taylor Heinicke stepped in as his backup, starting games much like he\'s done intermittently over the last couple of seasons. Going forward, regardless of Wentz\'s health, Heinicke will be the starter.  NFL insider Ian Rapoport reported the change:        ""Taylor Heinicke once again the starting quarterback for the Washington Commanders today and with Carson Wentz nearing full health- he was cleared to throw on the side this past week. My understanding is that Heinicke is expected to be the starter moving forward.""           He continued: ""Here\'s the way it is explained to me. He\'s the starter until he\'s not. In other words, until his performance necessitates a change, which no one expects, Taylor Heinicke is slated to be the starter. Think of how the team rallies around him, how they play for him. Consider that he is 3-1 as the starter."" Ian Rapoport@RapSheetFrom @NFLGameDay: The #Commanders expect Taylor Heinicke to be their QB moving foward, while the #Steelers may have found the right formula for RB Najee Harris.2     According to Rapoport, the quarterback has played himself into the starting role. It\'s hard to imagine the stunning victory over the previously unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles didn\'t play a part in the decision.  What is Taylor Heiniecke\'s record with the Washington Commanders and other teams? As a starter this season, Heinicke has gone 3-1 for the Commanders. Last season, he was 7-8 in Washington as the starter. He also played for Washington in 2020 but did not make a start.        He previously played for the Carolina Panthers and Houston Texans, but he started one game in those two seasons while appearing in seven. He lost his only start with the Panthers in 2018. Washington is 5-5 and in the hunt for a playoff spot. They\'re currently a half game behind the San Francisco 49ers for the final NFC playoff spot and are hoping the change to Heinicke puts them over the top. If he can continue his successful record, it could very well propel them into the playoffs. It might even leave Wentz looking for a new home yet again this offseason. He was brought in via trade last offseason to provide stability at quarterback but has thus far failed to do so.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit NFL Network and H/T Sportskeeda.

They defeated the then-unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles by a score of 32-21.  As started by Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, it's become a trend for players to don large chains and celebrate on the team plane after big wins.

Who should start: Taylor Heinicke or Carson Wentz? There's no denying that Wentz has talent. His 2017 season was incredible and he has shown flashes of brilliance ever since. The biggest issue with him is inconsistency. Washington Commanders v Philadelphia Eagles Sometimes, he makes tremendous throws and incredibly athletic plays. He sometimes throws the ball directly at defenders too. Wentz can show why he was selected second overall in one play and then follow it up with a huge mistake.        His backup doesn't seem to have the highs and lows that Wentz does. He may not be capable of making some of the plays that Wentz is, but he's also not going to make as many errors, either. Commanders head coach Ron Rivera has thrown Wentz under the bus once before this season. He will have a decision to make in the near future.   The Commanders have played fairly well with their backup, but he's the backup for a reason. It will be interesting to see where they are in the standings when Wentz returns and who they decide to start then on. If Taylor Heinicke continues to win games, there's a good chance he will get the nod.     "", ""Jacoby Brissett contract: How much will the former Browns QB earn with Commanders?  The Washington Commanders announced on Wednesday that they are signing quarterback Jacoby Brissett to a one-year deal worth $10 million.  The team lost quarterback Taylor Heinicke to free agency as he signed with the Atlanta Falcons and released quarterback Carson Wentz after just one season. Getting Brissett on board allows the Commanders to not overspend at quarterback.        Brissett was one of the best QBs available in the market after a good season with the Cleveland Browns. Although the team could not produce good results, it still saw their quarterback have some good individual performances. This was before Deshaun Watson took over following an 11-game suspension.           With the NFC East having Jalen Hurts and Dak Prescott as top quarterbacks, and the Philadelphia Eagles looking strong, Commanders had to find a stable veteran option. They, meanwhile, continue to search for long-term options. The new contract given by the Commanders includes $8 million in guaranteed money. Why are the Commanders signing Jacoby Brissett? Jacoby Brissett     He was a good quarterback last year, although the win-loss record doesn't back it up. He had some good performances while the Cleveland Browns' roster was not prepared to win games. Also, it was admirable to see him perform well even though he knew his stint as the starter would end. Brissett is not the kind of quarterback that will take you to the Super Bowl, but the Commanders are not contending anyway. The roster still needs more tools, and he's a quarterback with a low interception rate. He has played in 76 games before and has never thrown more than seven interceptions in a single season. Washington's idea is just to get the position stabilized as they study the quarterback's prospects. Will they move up in the draft to leapfrog other contenders for the position? Who knows. But they have a true chance of winning games with their new signing.The Commanders are not a team that would be a contender anyway, so at least they're making sure they don't give up on the season. A veteran quarterback is always the best option when you don't have anything for the long term yet, even though they have a lot of faith in Sam Howell.     "", 'NFL Fantasy Football Week 9: Quarterback rankings  Week 9 of the 2022 Fantasy Football season will prove to be one of the most challenging of the year when managers go to set their lineups. This is because six NFL teams are on a bye week.  Fewer teams playing means fewer options to choose from in Fantasy Football this week. This is particularly crucial for the quarterback position as each NFL team generally only uses one of them each week. With six teams in a bye week, only 26 starting quarterbacks will play a game, compared to a maximum of 32 quarterbacks.        Dak Prescott and Russell Wilson headline the quarterbacks that are not playing this week, along with Jimmy Garoppolo and Daniel Jones, who may be used as starters during other weeks. While Jacoby Brissett and Kenny Pickett will also be unavailable this week.               Fantasy managers featuring any of the six quarterbacks on their rosters will need to look at a replacement.

Gibson had his shoulder checked in the loss against the Los Angeles Chargers, but he played the rest of the game after being cleared by the medics, finishing the day with 20 runs, 90 rushing yards and catching three passes for 18 yards. Mike Clay@MikeClayNFLAntonio Gibson had 20 carries and also led the WFT in targets (5) today.3:24 AM ¬∑ Sep 12, 202121720     Gibson has no injury status for Thursday Night Football. Unless something extraordinary rears its head, the RB will take the field against the New York Giants. Antonio Gibson\'s injury sheet The sophomore RB dealt with his share of injuries last year. At the end of the season, Gibson played through a turf toe injury. When asked about his health during training camp, Gibson said: ""I\'m fine. I\'m out there making cuts, running routes, blocking, so I\'m fine."" Gibson also stated that most times, injuries are not only hard on the physical side of things, but especially the mental aspect of it all: ""When you\'re injured, it\'s a lot of mental aspects to it. So even when you\'re not hurt, sometimes people tend to think about it, you limp, or you\'re kind of compensating on the other side. So you try to get out of your head, play as fast as you can, worry about it after the game, make sure you treat it up well so you can be ready for the next day.""     A turf toe injury can be a tricky injury that requires a lot of time to recover from, and there is a chance a player may never recover fully. That is why the mental aspect is so important, and that\'s why it\'s encouraging to see Gibson focusing more on his game than on his injury. Last year, as a rookie, Gibson posted big numbers. He played 14 games, starting 10. The RB attempted 170 rushes, gaining 795 yards‚Äî4.7 on average‚Äîand scored 11 touchdowns. In the passing game, he received 36 passes for 247 yds‚Äî6.9 on average‚Äîbut failed to score. Coincidentally, Gibson\'s longest run and catch was the same: 40 yards. The rookie RB also suffered two fumbles, losing both. The expectation for Gibson in 2021 WFT fans have been waiting with bated breath for Gibson\'s sophomore year. After last week\'s showing against the Chargers, WFT supporters are confident the RB will steal the show, especially against a Giants defense that allowed 165 rushing yards (Melvin Gordon III 101 yards, Javonte Williams 45 yards, Teddy Bridgewater 19 yards) to the Denver Broncos.     Gibson has a chance to have another monster performance tonight.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 2 TV Schedule     ', 'Why is Carson Wentz not playing tonight? Reason why the former Eagles QB is benched by Commanders  The 4-5 Washington Commanders are taking on the perfect 8-0 Philadelphia Eagles today, but Carson Wentz is nowhere to be seen. The former Eagles quarterback\'s absence is conspicuous; instead, Taylor Heinicke is starting.  The Commanders placed Wentz on the Injured Reserves list on October 22 after he underwent surgery to fix a fractured finger. The quarterback is eligible to return in Week 11 but will likely be Heinicke\'s backup.        Wentz being relegated to the backup role is not surprising. Heinicke has started in Carson Wentz\'s place in the last three games and has a 2-1 record. It would have been 3-0 if they had not collapsed late against the Minnesota Vikings. With Wentz, the Commanders had a 2-4 record. It is generally not surprising to see a winning quarterback take over for a quarterback with a losing record.           Furthermore, head coach Ron Rivera has been critical of Wentz in the past, putting down their struggles solely to their quarterback position. Hence, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that he would choose Heinicke to start instead. PointsBet Sportsbook@PointsBetUSA""Why are the other NFC East teams ahead of you?""""Quarterback.""Ron Rivera threw Carson Wentz straight under the bus 1795237     Also, when the Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Commanders met earlier in September, the Commanders lost 24-8. It was a personal trial for Wentz as he was sacked nine times by his former team, which seemed bent on exacting revenge on their former quarterback. So, there are a myriad reasons to bench Wentz for this game. Based on his previous performances against this opposition, lack of faith from the coach, and his general lackluster performances, it should not be a surprise.  But the reason that Carson Wentz is not starting today is more academic. He fractured his finger in Week 6, playing against the Chicago Bears, and was accordingly placed on injured reserve. That means he will be eligible to return after this week and is presently inactive. Will Carson Wentz remain a backup for the Commanders even after the Eagles game?     A lot depends on how Taylor Heinicke performs today against the Philadelphia Eagles to determine if Carson Wentz has a chance of retaining the starting role next week. If Heinicke can knock off the undefeated NFL leaders against all odds, the clamor for him to be retained will grow. Heinicke is also familiar with being the starting quarterback having played that role the entirety of last season when Ryan Fitzpatrick went down injured. Mark Bullock@MarkBullockNFLNot a great start for Washington. Leno beat to the edge and Heinicke gets taken down for a sack-fumble11 However, it is not going to be easy. He was already strip-sacked once in the game. To his credit, though, he rebounded to lead the Commanders to 20-14 over the Eagles at halftime. If he maintains that level of play, Carson Wentz will be left sweating and hoping his injury heals fast enough before the window for his possible return closes.     ', ""Who won the NFL game last night? Result and score from Sunday Night Football ft. Cowboys and WFT  In Week 16 of the NFL, the Dallas Cowboys entered Sunday Night Football against the Washington Football Team, knowing that they'd clinched the NFC East division crown earlier in the day (the Broncos lost to the Raiders, giving Dallas a tiebreaker over the Philadelphia Eagles).  The news apparently did not matter as the Cowboys throttled the Washington Football Team 56-14 in a game that was theoretically over by halftime.        Dallas Cowboys@dallascowboysEzekiel Elliott scored a pair of TDs, but it was his actions after another touchdown that garnered plenty of attention.#WASvsDAL | #DallasCowboys7:20 AM ¬∑ Dec 27, 202148037           NFL Sunday Night Football: Dallas Cowboys beat Washington Football Team Washington Football Team v Dallas Cowboys     By halftime of Sunday night's football game against the WFT, the scoreboard showed a 42-7 lead for Dallas. Dak Prescott & Co proceeded to play perhaps their most complete game of the season on both sides of the ball. Prescott began the scoring with a five-yard pass to Ezekiel Elliott in the first quarter. The quarterback ended with a statline of 28 catches of 39 attempts for 330 passing yards and four touchdowns. Amari Cooper, who recently pined about his role in the offense, also had a standout game with seven receptions for 85 yards and a 13-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter. The defense for the Cowboys also rose to the occasion as the 'former' best defensive player for the team, defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence, tipped a pass from WFT quarterback Taylor Heinicke, intercepted it and returned it 40 yards for a score. Cornerback Trevon Diggs also got in on the action by grabbing his league-leading 11th interception of the season.     Dallas Cowboys@dallascowboysWashington tested Trevon Diggs on the first play Sunday, and he made them pay with a pick ‚Äì tying a franchise record in the process. üòé#WASvsDAL | #DallasCowboys7:28 AM ¬∑ Dec 27, 202154044 Star rookie linebacker Micah Parsons, the favorite to win NFL Rookie Defensive Player of the Year and a finalist for NFL Defensive Player of the Year, recorded his 13th sack of the season. This places him only one-and-a-half sacks away from the all-time NFL rookie sack record of 14.5 set by Jevon Kearse of the Tennessee Titans in 1999. Meanwhile, the WFT imploded on both sides of the ball. Quarterback Taylor Heinicke was only 7/22 for 121 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.     The team could only muster a total of 85 yards rushing, and the offensive line allowed five sacks to the Dallas defense. But that wasn't the most embarrassing part of the night for the WFT. Starting defensive tackles and former University of Alabama teammates Jonathan Allen and Daron Payne got into a physical scuffle on the sidelines. Payne appeared to place his finger into the side of Allen's head. Allen apparently took umbrage at the act and took a full swing at his teammate, which resulted in several players intervening to break-up the melee. It is highly doubtful that the NFL will step in and penalize either of the two for the fight as this wasn't a brawl and these matters are typically handled within the team.

"", '""WITHOUT A DOUBT the most overrated QB"", ""We going nowhere with Dak Prescott"" - Cowboys fans slam QB for horrendous performance vs. Commanders  Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys came into their game against the Washington Commanders with a chance to win the NFC first seed spot. They needed the San Francisco 49ers and the Philadelphia Eagles to lose and defeat the Commanders. But forget about the other teams, because they could not even take their end of the bargain.  They lost the game 26 - 6 and much of the blame fell on Dak Prescott. They were playing essentially a reserve team in the eliminated Commanders. They were the favorites to win this game. But by the end of the game, Dak Prescott had a 37.8 percent completion percentage, throwing for less than 130 passing yards, one touchdown, and one interception return for a touchdown. His passer rating was less than 50. It was a horrible performance and the fans let them know on Twitter what they thought of him.

They will play Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on the road in their playoff game. Prescott cannot afford bad plays when playing against the greatest quarterback of all time. In the last three games, he has played against three backup quarterbacks and kept the opposition.     Skip Bayless@RealSkipBaylessSo in their last 3 reg-season games, the Cowboys have faced Gardner Minshew, Joshua Dobbs & Sam Howell. All 3 have had success. Not exactly how you build momentum into a playoff game at Brady.144690 Dak Prescott was mercifully withdrawn after this horrible performance. But it wasn\'t just that he lost this game. In the last three weeks, he has faced Gardner Minshew, Joshua Dobbs, and Sam Howell. Gardner Minshew is the backup quarterback to Jalen Hurts for the Philadelphia Eagles. Joshua Dobbs was playing his first game for the Tennessee Titans after signing from the Detroit Lions\' practice squad. Sam Howell is the third-choice quarterback for the Commanders behind Carson Wentz and Taylor Heinicke.     Each of these should have been blowout wins. Instead, they now go into the postseason severely bloodied and winded. They are looking to win their first Super Bowl of the millennium and Prescott\'s performance today does not give much hope. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are a 8-9 team with a losing record and the Cowboys should be favorites. But they still have Tom Brady and the Dallas Cowboys are as weak as they could be in the quarterback position.It was the worst possible outcome to their final regular season game. They will hope that it will not have any bearing on the playoffs. They have flattered to deceive in the postseason previously, and they will now be hoping their luck flips.

', 'Is Justin Fields playing tonight vs the New York Jets? Week 12 fantasy outlook and potential replacements for the Bears QB  Fans and fantasy managers around the globe are more than eager to know whether or not Justin Fields, the Chicago Bears quarterback, will play in Week 12. Although he is listed as questionable for the game against the New York Jets, it is highly unlikely that Fields will play tonight.  He is still recovering from a shoulder injury and the franchise doesn\'t want to risk him in this game. Once he\'s 100% healthy, he\'ll be back on the field, as Fields has played exceptionally well this season and they won\'t want to risk his development.        A few days ago, Bears head coach Matt Eberflus gave an update on Justin Fields\' injury. Here\'s what he said:           ""Justin\'s status is the same, you know, it\'s limited. He was limited his day in practice. So we\'ll see where it goes. He\'s feeling better, every single day. And we got 48 hours to assess that, to where we\'re gonna go with that. It\'s the same thing with this, you know, it\'s limited because of his shoulder."" Eberflus added: ""He\'s able to do a lot of things, you know, so we\'re getting them in there with what he can do. And he\'s been doing good in there. We\'ll see where it goes. Like I said, it\'s really a three-prong effect."" He continued:     ""You know, it\'s really more about the medical staff clear him all the way into that status. And then, you know, him feeling really good about his performance, being able to go out there and perform and then us coaches assessing where he is.""      The consensus is that with the BEars standing at 3-8, they have no realistic hopes of making the playoffs. Therefore, there is no benefit to risking their budding superstar for a potentially pointless matchup.     Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterJustin Fields, listed as questionable for Sunday due to his separated shoulder, is not expected to play vs. the Jets, per sources. Bears are expected to start QB Trevor Siemian, and the team also promoted Nathan Peterman from the practice squad Saturday to serve as the backup QB.4112471 Trevor Semien is expected to start for the Chicago Bears against the New York Jets in Week 12. Justin Fields\' absence will be felt immensely by the Bears as he has played the best football of his NFL career this campaign.

Alternative Week 12 fantasy options for Justin Fields     Justin Fields during Chicago Bears v Atlanta Falcons Justin Fields not playing against the Jets will be a huge blow for many fantasy football players, but there are other alternatives as well to replace the Bears quarterback. There are two quarterbacks that we believe are plausible trade targets (if your league hasn\'t passed/doesn\'t have a trade deadline). Justin Herbert, the quarterback for the Los Angeles Chargers, could be up for a big game. They will play the Arizona Cardinals, who have been quite poor defensively this season.     Another quarterback who could be up for a big game is Lamar Jackson, who\'ll be facing the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Acho\'s analysis of the Dolphins was spot on as Jalen Ramsey will undoubtedly improve the Miami Dolphins secondary. The presence of Vic Fangio will take the team\'s defense to the next level, and he will make both Bradley Chubb and Xavien Howard perform better. Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle can cause havoc on any defense and will be difficult to contain on offense, which is why the Dolphins fans should be very excited for the upcoming season.

Miami Dolphins rookie quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was benched mid-game for the second time this season during an unsteady performance against the Las Vegas Raiders.  The first time Dolphins coach Brian Flores benched Tagovailoa for performance reasons was during a Week 11 loss to the Denver Broncos. Tua was 11 for 20 for 83 yards and a touchdown before getting replaced with Ryan Fitzpatrick.         With 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter against the Raiders, the Dolphins were trailing 16-13. Flores was not satisfied with his rookie QB's play, benching Tagovailoa and replacing him with veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Miami's opening day starter -- under center.            Up to that point, Tagovailoa was 17 of 22 for 94 yards with a touchdown and no interceptions. He'd been sacked three times and rushed for 11 yards. Tagovailoa was efficient, but he could not move the ball down the field with a disappointing 4.3 yards per attempt.

The Raiders seemed to have Miami's number.  In a desperate race for the playoffs, coach Flores decided he wouldn't take any chances. Even if they lost, they would still be in contention for the playoffs, but a win will give them a lead over the Baltimore Ravens. Benching Tagovailoa resulted in a spontaneous win for the Dolphins against the Las Vegas Raiders, kicking the Raiders out of playoff contention.  Fitzpatrick connected with wide receiver Mack Hollins on a 34-yard completion with 12 seconds left in the game.  Ryan Fitzpatrick pulls off the NFL version of the no-look pass to set up the FG.

Jason Sanders gave a 44-yard kick allowing Miami to win 26-25 ultimately. Fitzpatrick swiftly made an impact for Miami on an 84-yard drive that ended a game-tying field goal with over 4 minutes to play. He finished with a 9-for-13 for 182 yards and a 59-yard touchdown pass to running back Myles Gaskin, sealing the win with an inexplicable downfield shot with 19 seconds left to set up the winning field goal.  Fitzpatrick completed five of six passes for 73 yards, including a 31-yard pass to tight end Mike Gesicki down to the Raiders 4 yard line -- the most extended play of the game.

Ben Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh Steelers (2004 season)  AFC Wild Card Playoffs - Former Pittsburgh Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Ben Roethlisberger in the first round of the 2004 NFL draft. Initially, he was the third-choice quarterback on the team behind Tommy Maddox and Charlie Batch. However, due to an injury to Batch during the preseason (and poor performances) and an injury to Maddox in Week 3, Roethlisberger was given an opportunity. He led the team to win a playoffs game in his rookie season.

He made his playoff debut in the Divisional round against the New York Jets and helped lead the team to victory in overtime with a game-winning field goal. The Steelers lost the AFC championship game to eventual Super Bowl champions the New England Patriots. #2. Joe Flacco, Baltimore Ravens (2008 season)  New York Jets Joe Flacco     The Baltimore Ravens selected Joe Flacco as the 18th overall pick in 2008 NFL draft. Flacco was meant to be the third-choice quarterback, but due to injuries to starter Kyle Boller and an illness to Tro Smit, Flacco was given the nod. Flacco finished his rookie season with a pass completion percentage of 60.0%, 2,971 yards, and 16 touchdowns. Flacco and the Ravens secured their place in the playoffs and defeated the Miami Dolphins 27-9 in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. Flacco became the first quarterback to win two consecutive playoff games in their rookie season after a 13-10 divisional-round victory over the Tennessee Titans. The Ravens lost the AFC championship game against the Steelers 14-23. #3. Mark Sanchez, New York Jets (2009 season)  Jacksonville Jaguars v New York Jets     Mark Sanchez was taken in the first round of the 2009 NFL draft. The New York Jets traded their first- and second-round selections, as well as three players, to the Cleveland Browns to take him fifth overall. The 2009 season began on a high note for Sanchez, winning three consecutive Pepsi Rookie of the Week awards in the first three weeks of the campaign. He also made history by becoming the first rookie quarterback to start and win his first three NFL games. Warren Sharp@SharpFootballlast Jets QB with a winning record in New York was Mark Sanchez8-12: Zach Wilson1-7: Joe Flacco1-2: Mike White13-25: Sam Darnold0-2: Luke Falk0-1: Trevor Siemian5-11: Josh McCown1-6: Bryce Petty13-14: Ryan Fitzpatrick1-2: Mike Vick12-18: Geno Smith33-29: Mark Sanchez1516133     However, the remainder of the season was not as smooth. In Week 4, Sanchez threw an interception that led to a 99-yard touchdown. In Week 6, he threw five interceptions in a 16-13 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Sanchez and the Jets rallied to finish the regular season with a 9-7 record, securing a spot in the playoffs. In the Wild Card round, they secured a 24-14 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. Sanchez and the team went on to win the Divisional round game against the San Diego Chargers 17-14. Sanchez became the second rookie quarterback in NFL history to win his first two consecutive playoff games following Joe Flacco in 2008. Despite their success, the Jets eventually lost their AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts with a score of 30-17, giving up an 11-point lead. #4. Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks (2012 season) Russell Wilson - St. Louis Rams v Seattle Seahawks, 2012     Russell Wilson was selected by the Seahawks as the 75th overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft. After competing for the starter position with veteran quarterback Matt Flynn and Tarvaris Jackson, Wilson was given the nod for the 2021 season. Wilson threw for 3,118 yards and 26 touchdowns in his rookie season, tying the record set by Peyton Manning for most touchdown passes by a rookie. Wilson's ability as a running quarterback contributed to 489 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. Led by Wilson, the Seahawks secured a playoff spot and went on to win their wild-card round game against the Washington Redskins by a score of 24-14. Wilson had a solid performance, throwing for 187 yards and rushing for 67 yards. They would eventually lose the divisional round game against the Atlanta Falcons by a field goal with 31 seconds left on the clock. #5. Brock Purdy, San Francisco 49ers (2022 season)  NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Seattle Seahawks v San Francisco 49ers     Brock Purdy was selected as the 262nd overall pick in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL draft. After injuries to initial starters Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo, Purdy was given the nod to start in Week 13. To the amazement of many, Purdy put up impressive numbers, throwing for 1,374 yards and 14 total touchdowns in five games as the 49ers starting quarterback. The 49ers met the Seahawks in the Wild Card game of the playoffs and won 41-23.Purdy threw for 332 yards and three passing touchdowns, as well as scoring a rushing touchdown. Purdy will have the chance to become the third rookie quarterback to win consecutive playoff games.     "", ""NFL 2018: Ranking the new QB situations for 2018 season  The 2018 off-season began even before the Super Bowl 52 was played. The Washington Redskins agreed to trade for quarterback Alex Smith from the Kansas City Chiefs in late January thus resetting the QB market even before the season ended. Two teams already had two new quarterbacks before the Eagles could beat out the defending champions in February.  The trade freed the embattled ex-Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins to sign with the Minnesota Vikings in Free agency. The Vikings, who made it to the NFC Championship game, had three starting-caliber quarterbacks and let them all hit the free agency and signed Cousins to a first-ever full guaranteed contract.        Weeks prior to the start of free agency it was obvious that the Cousins-Vikings marriage is inevitable, which prompted the MVP of Vikings season Case Keenum to struck a deal with Denver Broncos even before the Cousins deal was finalized. This Keenum deal started the domino effect with many teams that are in the QB market started making deals.           Cleveland Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor from the Buffalo Bills, one of many trades they made this offseason. Arizona Cardinals signed Sam Bradford, New York Jets Signed Teddy Bridgewater and then traded him to the New Orleans Saints after an amazing preseason. AJ McCarron signed with the Bills and got beat out by rookie Josh Allen to become the starter which prompted the Bills to trade him to Oakland. Speaking of rookies, the 2018 draft had as many as Five QBs taken in round 1. By Week 4, four of the 5 are starting and the fifth QB is already seeing some game action in trick plays.     Including both the Veterans and Rookies, there are as many as Eight teams who had new Quarterbacks starting for them this year. Let's take a look at how these QBs fared so far with their new teams. Let's start with a Bonus player, the man who took the league by surprise and then crash landed in week 4:  BONUS: Ryan Fitzpatrick (2-2)  Oh, where to start. When I first started to think about this article after week 2, I had him competing for the number 1 spot with the current number 1 and then week 4 happened and the head coach Dirk Koetter has announced that Jameis Winston will be starting after the week 5 bye.     Since, FitzMagic is just a placeholder for Winston, who was serving his 3-game suspension, I decided not to include him in the rankings but thought he deserved a shout-out for his performance through the first three weeks. He went 2-2 in his starts when no one expected him to be anything better than 1-3. He faced three playoff teams from last year and went 2-1 in those games and came close to being 3-0 while trying to make an epic comeback against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 3. He posted 400 yards in each of his first three games, an NFL record. But week 4 proved why Fitzpatrick is who he is, a journeyman quarterback. The four-game stretch should help him get more money in the next offseason and will be a highly paid backup QB. #8 Josh Rosen/Sam Bradford, Arizona Cardinals (0-4)      Two teams have already started two quarterbacks who were not on their roster last season, one of them is Arizona Cardinals. Cardinals, who saw both their quarterback and head coach retire after last season had a complete overhaul in coaching and QB room. The added three quarterbacks including Mike Glennon. Sam Bradford, who is coming off injuries, signed a 1 year 20 million dollar contract and became a presumed starter. But, the Cardinals are off to a terrible start losing out in all the three starts prompting the change to go with the rookie Josh Rosen. Bradford in his three starts completed 62.5% of his passes for 400 yards and two touchdowns. But, he also had four INTs to his name. Bradford, couldn't move the ball well under Mike McCoy's game plan. He struggled in the first 2 games where the offense only scored 6 points in total. He started off well in the Week 3 matchup against the Chicago Bears where he tossed two TDs to start the game, but then couldn't find the momentum in the rest of the game which paved the way for the rookies Josh Rosen to come in the fourth quarter and try to win the game which was a very close contest.         Rosen was named starter for week 4 and quietly had an impressive debut. Rosen probably threw for only 180 yards but kept the Cardinals in the game without making any stupid mistakes. Cardinals eventually lost to the Russell Wilson's Seahawks, but had a glimpse of their bright future. The Cardinals running game needs to be picked up. The O-line has been one of the worst in the league, which handcuffed one of the elite tailbacks in David Johnson.     This Cardinals offense reminds me of 2016 Rams team which made Todd Gurley, Jared Goff and Case Keenum do nothing. This Cardinals offense is doing the same to David Johnson, Josh Rosen and Larry Fitzerald. Look for a coaching change to come this off season even though it is the first season as a head coach for Steve Wilks, at the very least the OC needs to be changed. With the correct play caller, this offense is capable of some high flying action ala Chiefs, Rams and the Texans. #7 Josh Allen/Nathan Peterman, Buffalo Bills (1-3)      Buffalo Bills had one of the strangest QB competition in NFL this offseason. They had three quarterbacks in the battle for the starting spot during the training camp. All thought that it would be AJ McCarron but instead as the preseason approached McCarron became third stringer and expendable, thus his trade to Raiders. The Bill surprisingly announced Nathan Peterman over the rookie Josh Allen as the starter for week 1, but Peterman repeated his first start performance from last year when he threw for 5 picks. He threw 2 picks and scored nothing, which led for the rookie Josh Allen to take the reigns. Allen in his three starts the next three weeks, completed only 53.4% of passes throwing just two touchdowns with four picks. His best game came in week 3 when the Buffalo Bills stunned the world by beating the Minnesota Vikings. Allen had three total TDs, 2 of them coming on the ground, showing off his athleticism in that game. But, he came back to earth in week 4, throwing 2 picks against an average Packers defense.     Allen, as expected, is raw and playing like a typical rookie. In an ideal scenario, he could use a redshirt season before taking over the reigns like Patrick Mahomes, but he did not have the luxury of learning under someone like Alex Smith, instead, the situation has thrust him into starting role early. He is going to have some growing pains but if week 3 is any indication he is going to be big in long term. #6 Baker Mayfield/Tyrod Taylor, Cleveland Browns (1-2-1)      This is the second team in the list that already had two starters who were not on the roster last season. The Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor during the offseason. A month later the Browns picked Baker Mayfield with the number 1 overall pick. Mayfield was supposed to be redshirted this season with Taylor holding the place for the year at least until the Browns are out of Playoff contention. But with Taylor's concussion in Week 3 Thursday Night matchup against the Jets, Mayfield came in late second quarter and helped Browns mount the comeback and give the franchise its first win in 17 games. Browns had a great start to the season, mostly thanks to the defense which stifled Ben Roethlisberger in Week 1. Drew Brees also had a tough time playing against this defense. Browns started 0-1-1 in the first two weeks and entered week 3 as favorites for the first time in almost two seasons.     Tyrod Taylor apart from a couple of plays had a tough start to his Browns tenure. That bad form continued in week 3. The first half of that game was unwatchable with Tyrod under center. But, when Mayfield came into the game, the dynamics changed. Browns offense is fun to watch after a very long time, He made the plays that Tyrod Taylor would hesitate to do.     Mayfield brought the life back into the Browns fans. The stadium was lit during the Second Half. That Second Half started a new era in Cleveland Football History. Mayfield was named a starter for Week 4 and beyond as expected. On his first start though Mayfield came back to earth against the Oakland Raiders.     Mayfield threw for two touchdowns but also had four turnovers which resulted in 21 Raiders points. Mayfield showed off his athletic skills, but also showed it was premature to make him a HOF player after that amazing second half in week 3. It is going to be interesting to see how the Browns and Mayfield will continue the rest of the way in all of a sudden new look AFC North that has Steelers tied at the bottom of the table instead of the top. #5 Sam Darnold, New York Jets (1-3)      Darnold was the only rookie quarterback who was named the starting quarterback prior to week 1. He had to earn the job in a battle with Teddy Bridgewater. Both Darnold and Bridgewater had a good preseason leading the Jets to trade Bridgewater to Saints and announce Darnold as a starter. Unlike other rookies, Darnold had an impressive start to his career. He completed 76% of his passes for 198 yards, 2 TDs and a pick with an impressive 116.8 rating. But after that, he came back crashing to earth. He had 4 more INTs to only 2 TDs in the remaining three games.         Darnold had his first career game without any interception in week 4 against a very good Jacksonville Jaguars defense. That should be considered a minor victory for a rookie QB who is struggling after a strong start. Unlike other quarterbacks, Darnold isn't surrounded by high flying talent. His receivers and the running backs are well below league average. In order to succeed long-term, the Jets need to provide weapons around him as the Bears did with Mitchell Trubisky this year, which helped him go off in week 4. Quincy Enunwa and the receivers need to step up and help the rookie QB to have any shot this year. Patriots, who had a slow start are getting back their groove right in time with Julian Edelman returning from his suspension. Jets will be facing a tough Denver defense in week 5. if Darnold could escape that game without a Turnover, they could have a very good chance to escape with a W. He could take some pointer from his veteran backup and mentor Josh McCown.     #4 Alex Smith, Washington Redskins (2-1)  Alex Smith has been his typical self to start the 2018 season with his new team the Washington Redskins. He has a completed nearly 70% of his passes and scored 4 Touchdowns with a pick and a 2-1 record. That is a typical Alex Smith stat line. Smith had a good start for his redskins tenure against the Cardinals, where he threw for 255 yards and a couple of TDs. But, in week 2 against a mediocre Colts defense Smith couldn't find the endzone even though completing nearly 72% of his passes. He and the Redskins bounced back in week 3 against the Packers where he outplayed Rodgers to upset the Packers.     Smith success correlates with the success of the running game. in the two wins, the Redskins new running back, Adrian Peterson rushed for nearly hundred yards and has scored a TD at least once, in the loss against the Colts he rushed 11 times for just 20 yards. Smith is one of those QBs who needs all the dominoes around him should work efficiently to find the success. He does not commit any back-breaking mistakes but he does not even get you out of the gate if fallen behind. NFC East is vulnerable right now and Redskins sit on top of the division even with their bye on week 4. The one difference between the Chiefs and the Redskins is that they lack that dynamic pass catcher that could help a QB out. Jordan Reed had some success in the wins but Jamison Crowder has yet to find the rhythm. It will be interesting to see if Smith can help out the Redskins to remain on top of a very close NFC East race as he did with the Chiefs the past few Seasons.     #3 Case Keenum, Denver Broncos (2-2)  Case Keenum, an undrafted free agent out of the University of Houston, had one of the most unprecedented journeys to become the starting quarterback of Denver Broncos. After his amazing career year in 2017 with the Vikings, Keenum signed a 2 year 36 million dollar contract with the Broncos. But, so far Keenum was not able to replicate the kind of success he had last season. Keenum had a total of 7 INTs in 2017 season has already thrown for 6 so far in four games and just tossing three touchdowns. Keenum's decision making at times seem erratic. He is trying to do more than what the defenses are giving him.     Even with his erratic play Keenum found some early success in the first two weeks by having two clutch game winning drives, which Broncos did not have last season. He almost had a third game winning drive on the MNF, week 4 against the Chiefs. He overthrew a wide open Demaryius Thomas which could have resulted in a game winning TD. In the next play he did connect to the rookie Courtland Sutton in an old-school hook and ladder play call.         Keenum, just like Smith is a game manager who needs to have a better player all around him. He has a solid running game with the two rookies, Royce Freeman and Phillip Lindsay sharing the work load, but the receivers apart from Emmanuel Sanders haven't really stepped up. The reason for having Keenum just a tick above the Last year with Vikings Keenum had Thielen and Diggs who had some amazing catches that helped out Keenum. Keenum knows that Demaryius Thomas is no longer in that elite group and need to be more careful forcing the ball into the tight coverage. The reason I have Keenum a tick above Alex Smith is that of his Clutch performance in weeks 1 and 2 and his NFC Championship game appearance just a few months back. I still think that Keenum is an upgrade to what Denver had last season and could help them have a fighting chance to at least grab the Wildcard spot in the playoffs.     There is no panic yet in Denver, there is a lot of season left and with no viable back up option left this will be Keenum's Season. If he can clean up the turnovers, this Denver team could be in hunt for a playoff spot in December. #2 Kirk Cousins, Minnesota Vikings (1-2-1)  Kirk Cousins, signed a monster contract with the Minnesota Vikings this offseason. After reaching the NFC Championship game a year ago with Keenum under center, the expectations very sky high for the Vikings fans. Some even considered this a Superbowl or bust move.     If indeed it is a Superbowl or bust move, the Vikings are off to a terrible start. They opened the season with a W against the 49ers but tied it up in week 2 with the Packers thanks to some head-scratching roughing the passer penalties. But the real stunner cam in Week 3 when Vikings and Cousins looked almost clueless against a bad Buffalo Bills team who scored a combined 23 points in the remaining three games. Cousins was shutout for three quarters, he had a couple of strip sacks an INT and it was late in the 4Q that he tossed a TD almost in garbage time. Apart from that one week, Cousins was his usual self he completed nearly 70% of his passes, tossing 10 Touchdowns and just 2 picks. He has 1,387 yards in just 4 games and yet the record is 1-2-1 record.         Cousins tenure so far remained same like his Redskins tenure where he played very well when was not pressured too much. But, when pressured his performance goes down. In 2018 so far his rating when the pocket is clean was 112.2, but when he is pressured it dramatically drops down to 89.8. Cousins even brought his fumbling issue from Redskins to Vikings, in which he is second most to fumble the ball since 2015. The Vikings O-line performance has been masked by Keenum's athleticism last season of avoiding the sacks, which Cousins clearly lacks. If Vikings need to find success with Cousins under center they need to provide a clean pocket and give him time to make the plays that Keenum couldn't have done last season. The NFC North looks very interesting with Chicago Bears on Top with Packer right next to them. If the Vikings need to be in the Playoffs in a very tough NFC they need to keep teh pocket clean for Cousins.     #1 Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs (4-0)  Patrick Mahomes is not a new player that was signed or added this offseason but he is the new starter for the Kansas City Chiefs after they traded Alex Smith to the Redskins. Mahomes did start in week 17 of last season but still, this is the first season as a full-fledged starter and thought he should be in this conversation. After the kind of start he had, he certainly should be.     Mahomes had one of the best starts since the Peyton Manning's record-breaking 2013 season. Mahomes even broke the Manning's record of 12 total touchdowns by tossing 13 through weeks 1-3. During the first three weeks, Mahomes was off to fast starts putting up 20+ points to start the game and make the opposing offenses play catchup to the Chiefs. The real test for Mahomes came in week 4 against a very good Broncos defense in a very rowdy Denver environment in Monday Night Prime-time slot. He had a slow start where Denver's defense had his number during the first three quarters. But he remained calm and made some timely passes in the fourth quarter resulting in one of the most thrilling matches in 2018 season so far.         The most amazing fact about Mahomes' performance so far in 2018 is that he has yet to throw an interception. In his four starts this season he has 15 touchdowns and zero picks. This INT-less streak should be attributed to his redshirt year in 2017 under Alex Smith. There is no better player to learn from how to remain interception-free. Mahomes performance so far is a reminiscence of Deshaun Watson's performance for Houston Texans last season. Mahomes is bound to be regressed in coming weeks, which could happen very well in week 5 against a very strong Jaguars defense, who allowed only a total of 4 touchdowns. The sky is the limit for Mahomes and this Kansas City offense. All they could ask for is the defense to play some average level play who currently are last in passing yards allowed. If the defense is not improved, a very good offensive season could very well be ruined come January. Mahomes, distanced himself from others atop of the MVP race, not a bad way to kickoff your first full season as a starting NFL QB. Let's hope the football gods spare Mahomes that bit the likes of Wentz and Watson last season during their own MVP campaigns.

34,Mike Glennon,"[""5 NFL coaches Cardinals could've considered for HC instead of Jonathan Gannon\xa0  The Arizona Cardinals have a new head coach, Jonathan Gannon. The former Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator took on the job just days after taking his team to the Super Bowl. After working in a variety of positions on defense, he now takes his first head coaching job.  It might be a good fit, but he was not the only option available. There were reports that Arizona were trying to get Sean Payton before he chose the Denver Broncos. They interviewed other candidates as well who might have taken this job.        While we wish Gannon all the best, there are a couple of issues that stand out. An example being that the Eagles gave up 38 points in the Super Bowl and suffered some lapses in concentration during the final games of the regular season. Furthermore, with Kyler Murray's situation, maybe an offensive coach might have been better.           Considering such factors, we look at some other candidates the Cardinals could have chosen. Who else would have made sense for the Cardinals? #1 - Dan Quinn, DC, Dallas Cowboys NFC Divisional Playoffs - Dallas Cowboys v San Francisco 49ers     If the Cardinals wanted a defensive-minded coach like Jonathan Gannon, they could have looked at Dan Quinn instead. While Philadelphia allowed fewer yards per game, their points allowed was not as good as that of the Dallas Cowboys. While the difference was marginal (with the Eagles defense allowing 20.2 points per game compared to 20.1 for Dallas), Philadelphia was playing with Jalen Hurts, who did not turn the ball over with the frequency of Dak Prescott. That could have been a convincing argument to hire Quinn. However, he also has a head coaching pedigree, something Gannon does not. He took the Atlanta Falcons to the Super Bowl. At the time, he ensured that even though he came from a defensive standpoint, the offense flourished with Matt Ryan being named league MVP that season. Considering the situation in Arizona, where they need a coach who can develop Kyler Murray, this might have been a very good fit.     #2 - Eric Bienemy, OC, Kansas City Chiefs If one was looking for an offensive play-caller who has the resume to beat anybody else, it would have to be Eric Bienemy at the moment. He has been with the Kansas City Chiefs since 2018 and has won two Super Bowls. Bienemy has worked magic with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce and ensured that their offense flourishes even without Tyreek Hill this season. HBCU Premier Sports@HBCUSports1Another has passed, Chiefs Offensive Coordinator Eric Bienemy yet to Land NFL Head Coaching Job* 2022 offenese #1 won Super Bowl * 2021 offense #3 AFC Champ Gm* 2020 offense #1 Super Bowl * 2019 offense #6 won Super Bowl * 2018 offense #1 AFC Champ Gm762192 The issue with him is that he is always overshadowed by Andy Reid. The veteran coach gets credit for the play calls. However, considering that the Cardinals desperately need to figure out how best to use Kyler Murray, an offensive-minded coach like him could have been an asset.     #3 - Brian Flores, DC, Minnesota Vikings Pittsburgh Steelers v Miami Dolphins Brian Flores is the newly minted defensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings. He spent a year in Pittsburgh after his departure from the Miami Dolphins, but he now has a position in Minnesota. He was reported to have been interviewed for the job in Arizona. While Jonathan Gannon has done an amazing job this season, he does not have head coaching experience. That is something Flores had with Miami. He also had the job of handling a young quarterback there, who he had to mentor and help grow. He has been in that situation before as a head coach and might have risen to the occasion with the Cardinals.     #4 - Mike Kafka, OC, New York Giants In this year's NFL honors, the Coach of the Year award went to Brian Daboll. Not many would argue with it given where the New York Giants were a year ago compared to them making it to the Divisional round this season. One of the main reasons for their improvement was the increased maturity shown by quarterback Daniel Jones. Much of that credit should go to Mike Kafka, who oversees the offense there. felix üáµüá∑@FootballPapiNews coming through as I'm at work: Jonthan Gannon getting the Cardinals job means that #Giants OC Mike Kafka returns and gets another year with Daniel Jones. Exciting news that the NFL Coach of the Year gets to retain two of his biggest staff members. #TogetherBlue DJ gets‚Ä¶ twitter.com/i/web/status/1‚Ä¶     He has experience mentoring Patrick Mahomes in his initial years and has now turned Daniel Jones from being a near-bust to a good quarterback. This is someone who could have been just the right person to take Kyler Murray's development to the next stage. #5 - Steve Wilks, DC, San Francisco 49ers Denver Broncos v Carolina Panthers One can see why the Cardinals went with a defensive coach like Gannon. Despite needing someone to cajole the best performance out of Kyler Murray, another worry was their defense. They shipped 26.2 points per game, the second-worst in the league behind the Chicago Bears.     When confronted with this dual problem, the best person based on current record should have been Steve Wilks. He was the interim head coach of the Carolina Panthers and turned around a team that had looked hopeless all season. He suddenly got Sam Darnold looking like a real quarterback. He also tightened the defense and improved the run game. He showed his all-round caliber. The obvious issue with this choice would have been his previous history with the Cardinals, where he finished 3-13 in the 2018 season. However, that was before Kyler Murray was drafted and he had to manage with Mike Glennon and Josh Rosen.Considering his familiarity with the Cardinals and given both he and the team were in a different situation then, this could have been a possible, albeit unusual, option.

New York had arguably one of the worst games during the day's NFL action.   Things couldn't have gone any worse as they were completely dismantled by Chicago. The final score was 29-3, and the Bears had their way with the Giants in every aspect of the game.         One of the most embarrassing stats for the Giants was that the Giants ended the contest with -10 passing yards. Oddly enough, this is not the first time a team has ended up with negative passing yards in a game.           Here are five NFL games in which a team ended up with negative passing yards. Which NFL game had the most negative passing yards? #5 - Houston Texans vs. Oakland Raiders (Texans, -5 passing yards) The Houston Texans and the Oakland Raiders battled it out in the 2006 season. Although the game would ultimately be won by the Texans, they ended the game with -5 passing yards. David Carr went 7/14 for 32 yards, which ultimately led to a -5 passing yard situation for the team. The Texans rode the prowess with their two defensive touchdowns and a strong rushing performance from Ron Dayne to secure a 23-14 win.     #4 - New England Patriots vs. Tennessee Titans (Titans, -7 passing yards) There should be little surprise here as the New England Patriots were dominant nearly every season when Tom Brady was running things. The game in 2009 saw the Patriots take on the Tennessee Titans and completely dominate them with a final score of 59-0. Bernd Buchmasser@BerndBuchmasserThe Titans were the last team to gain negative passing yards: they had -7 while getting blown out 59-0 by the Patriots in 2009. twitter.com/SBNation/statu‚Ä¶SB Nation@SBNationYou had more passing yards today than the New York Giants1:22 AM ¬∑ Jan 2, 202273 The Patriots did all of this without logging a single sack. Vince Young went 0/2 on the day and Kerry Collins went 2/12 for -7 passing yards. An embarrassing day for the Titans.     #3 - Cleveland Browns vs. Jacksonville Jaguars (Browns, -9 passing yards) The Cleveland Browns were once the worst organization in the entire league. They proved that in 2000 when they were completely humbled by the Jacksonville Jaguars. The final score was 48-0 in favor of the Jaguars. The Browns quarterback situation was as messy as it could get. Spergon Wynn, Doug Pederson and Kevin Thompson all attempted passing situations that ultimately led to a -9 passing yards stat line for the team. #2 - New York Giants vs. Chicago Bears - (Giants, -10 passing yards) Sunday's game between the New York Giants and the Chicago Bears saw the Giants suffer embarrassment from the defensive prowess of their rivals. The first play of the game resulted in a fumble from Mike Glennon. The next series ended up being an interception. SB Nation@SBNationYou had more passing yards today than the New York Giants1:20 AM ¬∑ Jan 2, 20222805487     Glennon had an incredibly tough day resulting in a -10 passing yards situation that now lands New York on a list they never wanted to be a part of. #1 - San Deigo Chargers vs. Kansas City Chiefs (Chargers, -19 passing yards) Divisional games are always tough for one of the teams involved. Back when the Chargers were still in San Diego, they were destroyed by divisional rival Kansas City Chiefs. The game happened in the 1998 season, and the final score was 23-7, in favor of the Chiefs.Ryan Leaf was never a hugely accepted candidate at quarterback for the Chargers, and his 1/15 and four-yard performance didn't help matters at all. The final passing yard stat would be -19 passing yards. That is one of the worst cases of negative passing yards to ever happen.     ""]"
35,Philip Rivers,"[""What is the single game NFL passing yards record?  Joe Burrow's eye-popping stat line from his game against the Baltimore Ravens got people talking about the single-game NFL passing yards record. In the game, Joe Burrow completed 80.4 percent of his passes for 525 yards, four touchdowns and zero interceptions.  He completed 37 of 46 pass attempts to lead the Bengals to a 41-21 beatdown of the Baltimore Ravens in a performance that put the Bengals squarely in first place in the AFC North. It was an awe-inspiring NFL performance, but where does it land among the greatest NFL performances of all time? Here's a look at the record, as well as a feel for where Burrow's performance lands him on the list.        NFL record for passing yards in a game           Pittsburgh Steelers v Cincinnati Bengals The highest number of passing yards in an NFL game came in 1951, thanks to a performance by Norm Van Brocklin. Playing for the Los Angeles Rams, he threw for 554 yards en route to a victory over the New York Yanks, according to NBC Chicago. Van Brocklin played from 1949 to 1960. In his career, he threw for 173 touchdowns and 178 interceptions. There are a number of surprises about this. The first surprise is that a passing game from 1951 still holds the record for passing yardage in the NFL 70 years later. The second surprise is that, for all of the talk about how the passing game has advanced through the years, one of the biggest NFL passing records comes from a time when running the ball was preferable to passing it.

Herbert's performance during the 2020-2021 NFL season landed him the NFL's offensive rookie of the year award. After losing Philip Rivers, the Chargers' fan base worried that he could not be replaced easily.  Herbert came in and took over the team. Even though Philip Rivers will be one of the best quarterbacks to play for the Chargers, Justin Herbert has helped ease the loss. Justin Herbert has the quarterback build and a rocket of an arm. He is surprisingly accurate and is mobile enough to make defenses think.        Tom Brady took home the award for being the oldest NFL quarterback at the age of 43. Justin Herbert (22), on the other hand, took home the award for the youngest quarterback in the NFL during the 2020-2021 NFL season.

The Chargers can look forward to many playoff runs in the near future. Lets take a look at the stats that led him to the NFL offensive rookie of the year award.     Justin Herbert's 2020-2021 NFL season stats:-- Completions: 396-- Attempts: 595-- Completion percentage: 66.6%-- Passing yards: 4,336 yards-- Touchdowns: 31-- Interceptions: 10     "", ""Top 5 most overrated QBs in NFL history  Quarterbacks are so important that any half-decent player can become an overrated QB if the franchise they are playing for has had no luck in that position. Teams spend years, lots of money and draft capital to get the right quarterbacks, and if they are slightly better than the previous incumbents, the teams proclaim them to be the very best. Over the years, we have seen some good quarterbacks who might fall into the category of overrated QBs on closer inspection of their performances. Here are some we believe to fall into that category.  Overrated QBs over the years in the NFL        #5 - Tony Romo           Tony Romo's story and the franchise he played for made it special. Any player playing for the Dallas Cowboys automatically garners attention because they are, after all, the richest franchise also known as America's Team. His personal story is also perfect. He went undrafted in the NFL and then made it as the quarterback of the biggest franchise of them all. theScore@theScoreIs Tony Romo a HOF'er? üßê858 However, what makes him an overrated QB is that, even though he played with the Cowboys for so long, he ended up with a losing 2-4 record in the playoffs. He never even once made it to the Super Bowl, and that just does not merit the hype he got as the face of the Cowboys franchise.     #4 - Dan Fouts Dan Fouts was one of the best quarterbacks the San Diego Chargers ever had. But by no means was he all that he was made out to be. His quarterback rating was just 80.2 and his completion rate was just 59%. He had just 12 more touchdowns than his interceptions. Andrew Mason@MaseDenverIn 33 of their seasons, the Chargers had Dan Fouts, Drew Brees, Philip Rivers or Justin Herbert as their primary starting QB.They missed the playoffs in 22 of those years. And in none of those did they make it to the Super Bowl. (Their 1 SB appearance was with Stan Humphries.)36648 In the postseason, his performances made for even worse reading. He made it to the playoffs only four times and lost three times. During that time, he threw for 12 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. That included two games with five interceptions in a game. His quarterback rating was just 70.0 in those games. Even though he went to six Pro Bowls and is a Hall of Famer, he is definitely an overrated QB in our opinion.     #3 - Archie Manning The patriarch of the Manning family, Archie Manning, made it to two Pro Bowls, but his is more famous because of his sons, Peyton and Eli Manning. His record in the NFL is the worst for any quarterback with, at least, 100 starts at 35-101-3. He certainly was not helped by a weak New Orleans team that could not provide him any protection. But even when he got the ball away, it seemed to land an awful lot more with the opposition players than it did with his own team members. He threw for 173 interceptions and just 125 touchdowns. That is nearly one and a half times the interception as compared to touchdowns. His quarterback rating was a paltry 67.1. His sons' achievements have elevated him, but judged purely based on his skills alone, he was an overrated QB. #2 - Terry Bradshaw Terry Bradshaw might seem the weirdest pick on this list given he won four Super Bowls in six seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. However, those teams were not dependent on the quarterback because they had talent on both sides of the ball. One of the Super Bowls he won in a season had just seven touchdowns and eight interceptions. Such was the talent of the team that his weaknesses were well hidden.        Over his career, he had 212 touchdowns but 210 interceptions; hardly the hallmark of a great quarterback. He threw more than 20 interceptions five times in his career. His career is undoubtedly impressive, but in no way did he warrant a legendary status. Very much an overrated QB in our book. #1 - Joe Namath Joe Namath is a a legend for the New York Jets. He famously proclaimed that, in Super Bowl III, the upstarts from the American Football League would defeat the Baltimore Colts of the National Football League. But his performance in the game was nothing to shout about, even though he was given MVP honors. In the 16-7 scoreline, he did not have a single touchdown.       Over his career, he went 62-63. His quarterback rating was just 65.5, and he threw 220 interceptions as compared to 173 touchdowns. Numbers such as these do not scream legend at us, and that is why he makes the list as an overrated QB.     "", ""Former NFL exec. projects Colts QB Anthony Richardson to become a ‚Äúmuch better version of Lamar Jackson‚Äù\xa0  A former NFL executive recently shared with NFL Analysis Network‚Äôs Kenneth Teape, his high praise for Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson, even going as far as to say that he sees Richardson as an upgrade over Lamar Jackson.   The former NFL front-office personnel said:        ‚ÄúThe kid simply has it all. He‚Äôs got the body, he has the arm, he has the coachability. I think his ceiling is a much better version of Lamar Jackson.‚Äù           Considering Lamar Jackson's impressive career, which includes an MVP title, multiple Pro Bowl selections, and notable accomplishments at a young age, such a statement holds significant weight.  The Louisville alumnus also has a 45-16 record as starting quarterback and hasn‚Äôt even reached age 30. His contract negotiation drama ended when he agreed to a five-year, $260 million extension during Day 1 of the 2023 draft. That deal makes him the highest-paid NFL player in terms of annual average value. The prospect of Richardson being as good, if not better, than Jackson is undoubtedly a daunting thought for the rest of the NFL. Richardson, drafted fourth overall in the 2023 NFL Draft, showcased his athleticism during his final year at Florida, recording 654 rushing yards and nine touchdowns.     Standing two inches taller and weighing 20 pounds more than Jackson, Richardson possesses an impressive physical presence. His athleticism was further validated by his remarkable score of 99 in that category during theScouting Combine, a feat only accomplished by two quarterbacks since 2003. So far, so good for Anthony Richardson Several questions revolved around Anthony Richardson leading into the 2023 NFL Draft. There were concerns about his accuracy, considering he completed only 54.7 percent of his passes at Florida. He also started only 13 games in three seasons at Gainesville. But the Colts didn‚Äôt listen to those concerns by making him the third quarterback selected in the 2023 draft. Will Levis was projected to be chosen earlier than Richardson, but he fell to the Tennessee Titans in the second round. However, everyone involved in the Colts organization has nothing but praise for Richardson. He manifested great abilities during mini-camps, hopefully propelling him to become their next franchise quarterback.     Pat McAfee@PatMcAfeeShowAnthony Richardson is READY TO GO#PMSLive60557 Following a carousel of quarterbacks in recent years, including Philip Rivers, Carson Wentz, and Matt Ryan, the Colts are in search of stability at the quarterback position. Even Colts running back Jonathan Taylor drew comparisons between Richardson and Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, emphasizing the potential he sees in the young quarterback.While Richardson has shown promising signs both on and off the field, he will have to compete with Gardner Minshew for the starting role under new head coach Shane Steichen. The Colts will evaluate the performances of both quarterbacks before making a final decision on their starter.     ""]"

In addition to a roster with holes in several areas and the legal issues surrounding quarterback Deshaun Watson, the team has several players who signed a one-year contract this offseason and will be free agents again in 2022.  Since the Texans will have very little cap space to work with in 2022, the team will likely lose important players.                   Five Houston Texans stars likely to be on the move.  #1 - Tyrod Taylor, QB Tyrod Taylor is just the bridge quarterback in Houston this year. He may easily win the starting spot over Davis Mills. Still, it's a classic case of a veteran quarterback who only holds the job until a younger player develops and takes over. In any case, Taylor has demonstrated on several occasions that he's not good enough to start in the NFL. It's hard to imagine a scenario in 2021 that would make it possible for him to return to the Texans next year.  #2 - Whitney Mercilus, OLB Whitney Mercilus is a critical player for the Texans, who has never received enough attention due to the presence of J.J. Watt. Mercilus was nominated for the second-team All-Pro in 2016. He has 54 sacks and 13 forced fumbles in his career.     After almost a decade with the franchise, the 32-year-old will hit the market next year as a free agent. He should sign with a team that is in optimal condition to win a ring. . Cincinnati Bengals v Houston Texans #3 - David Johnson, RB Some trades can go wrong for an NFL team. On a much higher level, we have the deal in which the Texans welcomed David Johnson from the Arizona Cardinals - or, in other words, the same trade that saw DeAndre Hopkins move to Arizona.     Texans: We wanna trade DeAndre HopkinsCards: hmm you sure?Texans: We want David Johnson and a second-rounderCards: /googles ‚Äúare there two david johnsons on the cardinals‚ÄùCards: ok we gotta swap fourth-rounders thoughTexans: Deal! This won‚Äôt come back to bite us at all!‚Äî Bill Barnwell (@billbarnwell) February 7, 2021 Johnson even had good numbers in 2020, averaging 4.7 yards per carry and surpassing 1000 scrimmage yards. But Hopkins is an elite wide receiver who has continued to play at a very high level with the Cardinals, while Johnson is an expensive running back that adds little to the team's overall performance. #4 - Maliek Collins, DT Maliek Collins is a solid player who'll have a starting role in the Texans' defense in 2021. Collins is the perfect example of a signing who, no matter how well he plays this season, won't be back next year because of Houston's dire financial situation.     He has performed well in his career with the Dallas Cowboys and can be an essential rotational player for several defensive lines in the NFL. Knowing he has the skills to play for a team that may reach the playoffs, he'll not return to the Texans in 2022. #5 - Randall Cobb, WR Randall Cobb won't be a free agent in 2022, but his $10.25 million salary, with only two million in dead cap if he gets cut, makes him an easy target for the Texans to make room on the salary cap - there's no way he'll be back in Houston on that salary next year. Cobb's prime was behind him when he was one of the primary weapons in the Green Bay Packers' potent offense at the beginning of the last decade. Despite reviving his career with good performances with the Dallas Cowboys and Houston in 2020, he can no longer be seen as a great wide receiver, with his skills being average at best. Cobb will be cut next year.Would be an interesting target for the Texans. Nick Caserio was in New England when the Patriots drafted Harry, and after Brandin Cooks, the Texans' best receivers are Randall Cobb and maybe Chris Conley. Harry would get opportunities. https://t.co/Fi945Jfs80‚Äî Aaron Reiss (@aaronjreiss) July 6, 2021     "", ""NFL Trade Rumors: Should the Houston Texans pursue Teddy Bridgewater?  The Carolina Panthers have been the most talked-about team when it comes to landing Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson. With the recent lawsuits that have been placed against Watson, it's going to be tough to get him at the moment. Deshaun Watson has made it known that he has no problem sitting out until the Texans trade him.  Houston recently added former Los Angeles Chargers back-up quarterback Tyrod Taylor, but it's hard to believe the Texans will enter the 2021-2022 NFL season with him as their starting quarterback. Instead of the Panthers pursuing the Texans starting quarterback, Houston would be wise to pursue Teddy Bridgewater to start while Watson sits.                   NFL Trade Rumors: How does Teddy Bridgewater help the Houston Texans? Carolina Panthers QB Teddy Bridgewater could help the Houston Texans The Carolina Panthers are projected to select a quarterback with their eighth overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft.

He struggles when the weight of a franchise is on his shoulders. When he started for the New Orleans Saints in 2019, Bridgewater went (5-0) as a starter. Back then, there was no question that Bridgewater was a temporary starter until Drew Brees returned from injury. His performance in the 2019-2020 NFL season landed him a big payday with Carolina, and Bridgewater held the weight of the Carolina Panthers franchise on his shoulders. They finished the 2020-2021 NFL season with a (4-11) record. If the Houston Texans pursue Teddy Bridgewater through a trade, they could be getting the same version of Bridgewater that played for New Orleans. The Texans have made it known that Deshaun Watson is their quarterback and that is not changing. This will take the spotlight off of Bridgewater. With the QB trade market heating up, here's where we think the top QBs end up:Deshaun Watson: #Panthers Russell Wilson: #Seahawks Carson Wentz: #Colts Sam Darnold: #WashingtonFootballDerek Carr: #Raiders Marcus Mariota: #49ers Teddy Bridgewater: #Texans Jimmy G: #Patriots‚Äî Turfside Talk (@TurfsideTalk) February 12, 2021     Teddy Bridgewater has the skill set to be a successful starting quarterback. He showed that with the Minnesota Vikings in 2015 when he finished with an (11-5) record. The Houston Texans will be getting a quarterback that will take a lot of risks. Outside of his rookie year and last season, Teddy Bridgwater doesn't turn the football over often. With all the issues surrounding Deshaun Watson, it only makes sense for the Houston Texans to find a temporary replacement. Teddy Bridgewater is the perfect temporary replacement for Watson for the 2021-2022 NFL season.     "", ""3 observations from the Houston Texans-Dallas Cowboys preseason matchup  The Dallas Cowboys are still searching for their first win of the preseason after a disappointing loss to the Houston Texans Saturday night. Jerry Jones' boys have one more shot against the Jacksonville Jaguars next week, and that game has now become more critical.  Unlike the Cowboys, the Houston Texans are heading into their preseason finale undefeated. With everything the Texans have gone through this offseason, finishing their preseason undefeated will be a massive win. The Texans may not be a dumpster fire after all.        Here are three observations from the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans' Week 2 preseason matchup.            Houston Texans rookie QB Davis Mills has shined during the preseason #1 Houston Texans starting QB job looks to belong to Davis Mills The Houston Texans entered their offseason with a massive question mark next to their quarterback position. One thing that was for sure in Houston was that Deshaun Watson wouldn't be playing. That left the Houston Texans with Davis Mills, Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel.     All three of Davis Mills' longest completions tonight are play-action strikes. pic.twitter.com/OpTTA9LAeo‚Äî Rivers McCown (@riversmccown) August 22, 2021 Davis Mills has outperformed both Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel over the last two preseason games. Mills completed 11 of his 22 passes for 112 yards and an interception against the Packers in Week 1. He followed that above-average performance by completing ten of his sixteen passes for 115 yards against the Cowboys. It looks like Davis Mills will head into Week 1 of the regular season as the starting quarterback in Houston. That's if a miracle doesn't happen and Deshaun Watson suddenly changes his mind.      #2 Dallas Cowboys are still searching for Dak Prescott's backup The Dallas Cowboys headed into their preseason matchup with the Houston Texans with three quarterbacks battling for one job. That job is backing up their franchise quarterback Dak Prescott. Garrett Gilbert, Cooper Rush and Ben DiNucci are all fighting for the backup role.

Cooper Rush bounced back against the Cardinals to prove he's not out of the race just yet. Ben DiNucci led the Cowboys in passing yards against the Texans, but he threw three interceptions.     With the Cowboys' preseason finale approaching quickly, Josh Rosen is starting to look even better. All three quarterbacks have had good and bad performances, making the Cowboys' backup quarterback spot an open race heading into their finale against Jacksonville.  #3 Dallas Cowboys haven't scored a rushing touchdown during the preseason The Dallas Cowboys fan base has been focused on the quarterback position and their defense. That has taken the attention away from their rushing attack. Dallas hasn't recorded a rushing touchdown in its three preseason games. Ezekiel Elliott hasn't appeared in any of the Cowboys' preseason games, but that doesn't take away their struggles. The Cowboys need their run game if they want Dak to have a successful season. With one preseason game left, the Cowboys will need their run game to find the end zone to build momentum heading into the upcoming season.Also Check Out: Complete Dallas Cowboys NFL Preseason Schedule 2021     "", '5 players who have surpassed expectations so far in 2021 NFL season ft. Ja\'Marr Chase  Every player entered the 2021 NFL season with a certain level of expectation. They were based on several factors such as past performance and team situation. Some players have surpassed them while others have struggled to meet them. Here are five players who have exceeded expectations in the 2021 NFL season.  Exceeding expectations in the 2021 NFL season        #5 - QB Davis Mills, Houston Texans           Davis Mills was drafted by the Houston Texans as a prospect for a possible role in the future. He was never supposed to be a starter in the 2021 NFL season, but circumstances forced him into the position. Deshaun Watson is dealing with issues off the field and his replacement, Tyrod Taylor, was injured early in the 2021 NFL season. Rivers McCown@riversmccownDavid Culley on Davis Mills/QB: ""It\'s extremely important for the entire football team, you know, to know that when you go out there that particular guy is going to do his job ... I feel like, in Davis, we have a guy like that, that in the future could be that kind of guy.""12:14 PM ¬∑ Oct 27, 2021151 All things considered, Davis Mills has done a good job filling in as a starting quarterback sooner than expected. He has statistically held his own with five other rookie quarterbacks who were all drafted in the first round, while he was selected in the fourth.     #4 - CB Trevon Diggs, Dallas Cowboys Trevon Diggs showed great potential in his 2020 rookie season. He got better as the season progressed and recorded three interceptions over his last five games. He entered the 2021 NFL season with expectations of being a solid cornerback, but he has taken things to the next level.

Exceeding expectations in the 2021 NFL season #3 - RB Ezekiel Elliot, Dallas Cowboys The 2021 NFL season has seen a revival of Ezekiel Elliot. He had the worst season of his career in 2020 by almost every measure. The short lifespan of running backs made many believe that his best days were long behind him and that he had become just an average player.

He ranks fifth in rushing yards, tenth in yards per carry and third in rushing touchdowns. Zeke is not done yet.     #2 - WR/RB Cordarrelle Patterson, Atlanta Falcons Cordarrelle Patterson was one of the biggest surprises of the 2021 NFL season. He has done it all for the Falcons this season, leading the team in rushing yards, rushing touchdowns and receiving touchdowns while also ranking second in receiving yards and third in receptions. He is also their primary kick returner. He is now 30 years old, and is having the best season of his career. He has been a utility player in recent seasons but hasn\'t featured in any offenses.

A clutch of QBs are heading into the final year of their contracts in 2021. These names will be on the quest to put up the numbers and performances that convince their own teams to show them the money and extend, or attract interest, from the rest of the league.        We have signed QB Ben Roethlisberger to a new contract for 2021.‚Äî Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) March 4, 2021            Which 7 quarterbacks are playing for a contract in 2022? #1 - Ben Roesthlisberger, Pittsburgh Steelers Big Ben is back in Pittsburgh and some reports suggest he\'s looking better than ever. That said, Ben Roethlisberger is 39 years old with a lengthy injury history. How much longer can he hold down the job on Mike Tomlin\'s team? For now, Roethlisberger is on a rolling one-year deal that is reviewed each off-season. The organization backed the 18-year pro in the NFL draft by picking up a range of offensive tools and there is still no sign of a succession plan. Roethlisberger\'s level of play in 2021 will dictate whether he returns in 2022.     #2 - Teddy Bridgewater, Denver Broncos It could be now or never for Teddy Bridgewater in an NFL starter\'s job. The 28-year-old leads a stacked roster on both sides of the ball into the 2021 season, knowing he hits free agency in 2022 after arriving at the Denver Broncos by trade. If Bridgewater even offers league-average QB play, then head coach Vic Fangio\'s loaded team could be set for a playoff run. A postseason appearance could lock Teddy in his spot for a few more years. Anything else, and Bridgewater may have to settle for a back-up job, either with the Broncos or his fifth NFL team in 2022. #3 - Ryan Fitzpatrick, Washington Football Team Ryan Fitzpatrick is heading into his 18th NFL season on his ninth team and the the 38-year-old finally has an opportunity to seize control of a starting quarterback job without a high-end backup ready to take his place. Washington head coach Ron Riveria has put his faith in the bearded veteran in a contract year, and Fitzmagic is another QB whose displays in 2021 will decide whether he earns an extension in 2022 ‚Äì or whether the soon-to-be-renamed Football Team begin their search for an immediate successor.     #4 - Jameis Winston and Taysom Hill, New Orleans Saints Sean Payton\'s New Orleans Saints go into the new campaign with both senior quarterbacks heading into the final year of their contracts ‚Äì which means 2021 is a ""prove it"" season for both of the Saints\' veteran passers. Jameis Winston has the first opportunity to stake his claim for a long-term deal as the starter in New Orleans, but if the former Buccaneer does not deliver, expect multi-threat weapon Taysom Hill to get another chance to show what he can do under center. Then it\'s decision time for Payton as he maps out the franchise\'s future. #5 - Andy Dalton, Chicago Bears With first-round rookie Justin Fields waiting in the wings, many expect Andy Dalton to be on a short leash in 2021. Chicago Bears head coach Matt Nagy has thrown his weight behind the idea of having an experienced starting quarterback in 2021, but Dalton will need to hold off a fierce challenge from Fields for the whole season to be realistically dealt another chance at starting in the NFL beyond this season.     #6 - Tyrod Taylor, Houston Texans It feels very much like Tyrod Taylor is being set up to fail in Houston. Having traded or released every playmaker on their roster over the past few seasons, the Texans seem happy to ride with Tyrod all the way to the number one overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. Taylor is facing an uphill battle, but has a chance to show enough to pitch for a back-up quarterback job, either in Houston or elsewhere, in 2022. Other quarterbacks that could be on the move QB1 & Coach#GoPackGo pic.twitter.com/QAo2ILpbug‚Äî Green Bay Packers (@packers) September 1, 2021     The big name that could be on the 2022 quarterback market is Aaron Rodgers. The reigning MVP agreed to return to Green Bay in 2021 and recent reports suggest the quarterback\'s reworked contract does not contain an out clause in 2022. However, FOX\'s Jay Glazer has claimed that Rodgers has a handshake agreement with Packers GM Brian Gutekunst about being granted a trade.Meanwhile, it was widely reported that Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson sought a trade in 2021. With playmakers of that caliber potentially becoming available once again in 2022, is any current starting quarterback\'s job really safe?     ', 'Evaluating the rookie quarterbacks with three weeks to go  We have now played 14 weeks and it is time to reflect a little. At this point I want to take a look at the five rookie signal-callers, who were drafted in the first round and all played between four and twelve games.  To make this clear, I didn‚Äôt want to rank the quarterbacks against each other because I think it‚Äôs still too early for that, but we can see what they have shown so far and talk about them. So I listed them purely based on where they were drafted at.        While all of them have shown promise and won some big games, the guy at the very top has truly stood out.            #1 Baker Mayfield While I thought the Browns reached for some players in the draft, I had no problem with the selection of Baker Mayfield at the top. I had Darnold as my number one quarterback, but Mayfield was in that group of three that I thought were all worth top five or six picks. He was kept on the sidelines for the first two-and-a-half weeks of the 2018 season, but when Tyrod Taylor had to go into the locker room in that Thursday night game versus the Jets, Baker came onto the field and hasn‚Äôt given up his job ever since. Not only has he given the Dawg Pound a ton of energy, he has also clearly been the top rookie quarterback and with all those outstanding rookies at all the other positions, he is right up there with the very best of that class. The numbers bear it out.     Mayfield has by far the highest completion percentage (64.4%) and yards per attempt (7.7) among all rookie signal-callers. I liked his arm and I thought he was a much better athlete than people gave him credit for, but he exceeded even my expectations. Baker throws a much tighter spiral and has a way stronger arm than you‚Äôd expect from a six-foot Big XII quarterback. He gets the ball out with anticipation, zip and pin-point accuracy. When you watch Baker‚Äôs first live-action versus the Jets and you compare it with what Tyrod Taylor did in the first half of that contest, you see the differences between a guy like him and a solid starter in Taylor. The Jets blitzed over and over again and forced Taylor to defeat tight man-coverage with his arm and getting the ball out hot, but instead he tried to run around and make things happen off script, which didn‚Äôt only end in him taking big hits but ultimately knocked him out of the game as well.     When Baker entered everything changed. He destroyed Gang Green‚Äôs blitzes by getting rid of the ball quickly and showing pocket awareness to maneuver around before dropping absolute dimes to his playmakers, who he showed trust in to win their matchups. The first overall pick has showcased clean footwork, outstanding mobility inside the pocket and tremendous command of the entire offense, making checks in no-huddle situations and deciphering opposing defenses. However, he doesn‚Äôt just have the mental aspects and fundamentals down before letting the ball go, he has made some throws that force even his biggest critics to raise their eyebrows. He has defeated tight man-coverage with Drew Brees-ish pin-point accuracy and he has delivered has some absolute ropes into tight windows. Probably his best game came versus the Panthers last Sunday. He launches several unbelievable downfield passes with a defender in almost perfect position, but with the placement of the ball those throws were basically indefensible.     Mayfield has clearly displayed the ability to diagnose a multitude of defensive looks and counter them with the understanding of where the ball needs to go, but at the same time you can not just get into the face of his pass-catchers and force him to throw those guys open ‚Äì because he will do just that. Mayfield had by far his two worst games versus the Chargers and Texans ‚Äì two teams that clearly were better from top to bottom on those days and overall as well. If you take those two performances out of the equation, he has thrown 17 touchdowns compared to just five interceptions. Obviously you have to take everything into consideration, but versus the Chargers those picks came on two great plays by Desmond King undercutting routes and all three at Houston happened because he tried to fit in some passes. So it‚Äôs not like he just misdiagnoses coverages or gets rattled by the opposition. Mayfield is just a gunslinger, who has trust in his arm and his receivers.     I have no problem with that, because he will still learn which chances he should and should not take. For every throw he attempts that simply isn‚Äôt there, there will be five others were you would think the same but somehow they get completed. Most importantly he takes care of the ball when he has his offense in scoring range, displayed by his QB rating of 115.1 in the opponents‚Äô red-zone. Since Hue Jackson and Todd Haley were fired following a week eight loss to the Steelers, Baker has completed 73.2 percent of his passes for 11 touchdowns and four picks (with three of them occurring in that Texans game), plus the Browns have won three of their five games ‚Äì which are as many wins as they had under Hue in 40 games. New offensive coordinator Freddy Kitchens has really helped out his rookie signal-caller by implementing elements of his college offense and doing an outstanding job protecting him, making him the least-pressured quarterback in the league these last few weeks.     If you made the Browns choose all over again who they would select with that number one overall pick, John Dorsey would run up to the commissioner with that card himself. Baker Mayfield brings an energy and sense of confidence this franchise hasn‚Äôt had since they were re-established almost 20 years ago. He is a perfect fit for the city of Cleveland and this fanbase deserved to finally get a guy like that. #2 Sam Darnold Darnold was really careless in particular in his meetings with the Dolphins, turning the ball over six total times For the second quarterback drafted in April it has been much more of an up-and-down season.     Right now he leads the league with 15 interceptions despite missing three games and he has thrown just 12 touchdowns compared to that. He has also completed 60 percent or more of his passes in just four of his ten starts and he has three games in the 30s in terms of quarterback rating. However, he also gave the entire Jets fan base hope with an incredible performance in the season-opening destruction of Detroit, led them to big wins over AFC playoff contenders in the Broncos and Colts while putting up 34 and 42 points respectively and he just rallied them to a win over the Bills, in a game they probably should have lost. Even his first play in a regular season game was very shaky, as he started off his career with a pick-six throwing across the field. This already showed you that he will take chances and he has tried to fit throws into tight windows on plenty of occasions.     Yet, he has also displayed that he is mentally strong enough to shake those things off and go after it the very next snap. After three straight losses in which he threw two TDs compared to four picks, the Jets put together their only consecutive wins. They followed that up with another trio of losses, in which Darnold really looked bad at times. Overall he has two games with two INTs, one with three and another one with four. I watched almost all his tapes and there were some dark moments, but you also see what I liked about him coming out of USC and he is as tough as a five-dollar steak. Darnold was really careless in particular in his meetings with the Dolphins, turning the ball over six total times. He got fooled by a defender in underneath coverage drifting one way and then coming back for the pick and once stared down his receiver on an out-breaking route, allowing the linebacker to drop all the way underneath it.     However, in week two he almost led his team back to a victory and his second interception was more on the receiver running a weak route in the end-zone and allowing the DB to beat him to the spot plus his receiving crew dropped four passes, while in week nine he had to deal with horrendous snaps for about half the game and threw his final two interceptions on fourth-and-very long, although another two were flat-out dropped by defenders. Still, even in those games you saw clutch throws on third down and good accuracy on the move. That has been the theme for large stretches of his rookie campaign ‚Äì turnovers and risky throws happening due to a lack of help from his pass-catchers. Even versus the Vikings, when he threw three interceptions, one of those throws was a wobbler because his left tackle getting pushed into him during the release and one came off the hands of his receivers on a perfectly placed slant route.     During Darnold‚Äôs three-game absence you could see how bad this roster still is. They lost all three games with Josh McCown at the helm, including a 41-10 embarrassment against the Bills, who were without their starting rookie QB as well. Darnold played far from a perfect game last Sunday at Buffalo, but he willed that team to victory. He got banged up early, went two of seven on third downs through about the first 40 minutes and made a really stupid decision on his interception, just tossing it up there scrambling all the way to the sideline and expecting a receiver to come up with it after turning his out-route upfield. But he also delivered some absolutely perfect balls right in stride on corner, deep out and fade routes that kept his team alive and made the play of the game on third-and-goal when he was flushed right and reversed all the way across the field before finding Robby Anderson in the end-zone.     He completed another big one on a go-route to Anderson, where he freezed the middle safety for a second and then dropped it right into the bucket of his receivers versus the Bills‚Äô top corner Tre‚ÄôDavious White, which set up the game-winning touchdown. The third overall pick has definitely had his struggles as a rookie, but a lot of that had to do with the team around him. Darnold has no true, dependable playmakers around him outside of Anderson and to a lesser degree Quincy Enunwa and his offensive line has been suspect at times. I loved what I saw from him in the preseason, diagnosing defenses pre-snap and then not panicking when they tried to confuse him, but rather moving on to his next read and delivering strikes. I am also encouraged by just four fumbles on the year, because I thought his biggest concern in college was the lack of ball-security while moving around.     Say what you want, but I still believe in this kid being the Jets‚Äô savior, because I think he has the perseverance to recover from bad plays as well as one bad season, and let‚Äôs not forget he only turned 21 a week after he was drafted. He can make those standard plays that keep offenses on schedule, but he can also create when nothing is there and deliver accurately outside the pocket. They need to load up with pieces around him to help their future out. #3 Josh Allen Enter caption     I had Allen as my number five quarterback and it was not as much due to the inconsistent accuracy that draft experts worried about, but rather because of poor pocket presence. I can make a quarterback throw every route and read every concept a million times at practice, but having a feel for when and how to move inside the pocket while maintaining a throwing posture and keeping your eyes downfield is much harder to teach, because it is somewhat of an innate ability. Far too often I saw Allen scramble and make bad decisions instead of maximizing the space he had in the pocket to make throws down the field or worst case go down and live for another play. The advantage he had over all those other guys I had ranked ahead of him was the fact that he had experience in a pro-style offense and his rare physical traits were off the charts. So far I think those are what really have stood out, while his mental game is starting to come along.     When I started watching Allen‚Äôs tape at Wyoming I saw a young Roethlisberger body-wise, but through his first nine games he has looked more like Cam Newton as a runner. He is now up to 490 yards and five TDs on the ground, with 401 of those coming off scrambles.  I remember a week three game versus the Vikings where the Bills pulled off the upset in a beatdown at Minnesota behind a ferocious defense and a Josh Allen killing the Vikes taking off multiple times.  Anthony Barr seemed to be Allen‚Äôs personal target, because he outran, trucked and even hurdled the 6‚Äô5‚Äù linebacker on separate plays.  Then in week 13 it was the Dolphins linebacker Kiko Alonso, who he once spun around like a ballerina and then beat to the edge on another scramble after he made a D-tackle completely whiff on like a dead-leg back juke.  I knew he was a tremendous athlete, but this guy is on another level. There‚Äôs only so many guys with the speed to run past linebackers one play and then have the size to run over them the very next.     In one of the crazier statistics I‚Äôve ever seen, Allen just broke Michael Vick‚Äôs record of rushing yards in a three-game span with 335. When you run like that fumbles occur, but only two times he has put the ball on the turf and saw the defense recover.  Through nine starts Allen is 26th among all players in the league with 29 runs resulting in first downs despite just 66 carries. Only Mitch Trubisky has turned a higher percentage of his runs into first downs among player with over 50 attempts, as 43.9 percent of Allen‚Äôs rushes have resulted in fresh sets of downs.  He has produced 19 runs of 10+ yards and has made it past the marker ten of his 17 rush attempts on third down (58.8 percent). All of that while missing four games with a banged up shoulder.  The Bills are a top ten rushing offense, but without their QB‚Äôs production only three teams would rank below them in total yards and they would be dead-last in yards per carry. You would like to see him take a few less shots, but he is one of the very few who has the frame to sustain that, plus he is starting to slide more.     In addition to what he does on the ground, he has a howitzer of an arm and he is starting to make some big plays with it.  Allen‚Äôs overall numbers are definitely not where you‚Äôd like them to be, as he is completing just 52.4 percent of his passes with five touchdowns compared to nine interceptions and a QB rating of 62.8, but a lot of that has to do with the situations he is put in. I already mentioned their poor rushing numbers if their QB doesn‚Äôt run it himself, as all other ball-carrier average 3.63 yards per carry ‚Äì less than half of what he does ‚Äì but the Bills also simply don‚Äôt have the playmakers to make things happen with the ball in their hands.  They are second-to-last ahead of only the Cardinals in yards after catch with a little over 1000 and even though I didn‚Äôt track the numbers, I can tell you that there are very few if any teams that have faced third & 10+ more often than Buffalo.     When watching the Bills rookie QB on tape the one thing that jumps out to you is his arm strength. I think Patrick Mahomes and Allen are about in the same ball park ‚Äì and I‚Äôm not sure if anybody else parks there.  He can be late on some throws and still get them to his targets before the defender has a chance to make a play on it because he just puts lasers out there, while also threatening any defense to go over the top.  His accuracy might not be ideal all the time, especially on easy dumpoffs and other underneath completions, but he is clearly precise enough to shred defenses. Even though he has put up crazy numbers on the ground since returning from injury, I have been very intrigued with some of the throws he has made during that stretch.  Versus the Dolphins in week 13 he launched two stupendous rockets to Zay Jones ‚Äì one running to his right and hitting hum at the end-line for a touchdown and then another one out of his own end-zone scrambling left and hitting Jones at the sideline on third and 12 for an extra ten off the wrong foot.      Last week against the Jets he was backed up inside his own ten and didn‚Äôt let the safety bait him into a risky throw on a go-route against a muddy coverage look, but instead stayed patient and drilled a shallow post that the receiver sat down over the middle, plus later he connected on a beautiful back-shoulder pass with a slot receiver running an inside fade route versus cover-one. While he made a stupid decision scrambling to his right and just throwing up a prayer while getting hit out of bounds ‚Äì which was intercepted ‚Äì I came away really impressed by the rookie.  On their go-ahead drive he almost put them ahead by a touchdown on a perfect pass to his receiver running a corner route towards the pylon on a designed rollout, before settling for three, which didn‚Äôt prove to be enough.  I don‚Äôt think anybody in this class nearly has the upside Allen presents. He can kill defenses as a scrambler against man-coverages and when he gets confused by coverage looks, he can throw off either leg and fading away better than a lot of guys can from a clean pocket and he is starting to make big-time throws from the pocket.      Obviously I‚Äôd like him to maintain a normal throwing posture more instead of moving East and West, but I take it for now. The Bills O-line has been sub-par, allowing Allen to be sacked on 10.3 percent of his dropbacks.  The only player on that offense to make anything happen with the ball in his hands recently has been Isaiah McKenzie and he only just started the first game of his career.  Not only are the Bills 3-6 with Allen as their starter, as crazy as it sounds when you look at his passing numbers, adding his rushing, Allen actually owns the highest QBR among all rookie quarterbacks so far. #4 Josh Rosen Rosen actually delivered some bullets to move the offence just outside field goal range     By far the most frustration for any offense and their rookie quarterback has taken place in Arizona. The Cardinals brought in career journeymen Sam Bradford and Mike Glennon in March before even having any idea about what could happen in the draft.  Sitting at number 10 overall with the Browns, Giants, Jets, Broncos and Bills all ahead of them and little draft capital to move up, there was a good chance that this team could have ended up with none of the four favorite quarterbacks.  However, with the Giants deciding to stick with Eli Manning for another year and the Broncos going with edge rusher over signal-caller after having signed Case Keenum to a deal, Arizona didn‚Äôt have to do anything but sit there and have UCLA star-quarterback Josh Rosen fall right into their lap.  However, they decided to start the season off with Bradford and that lasted less than three full games before they trotted their rookie out there.     In a very peculiar spot, down 16-14 with about four minutes left against the league‚Äôs number one defense in the Bears, Rosen saw his first regular season action and was immediately asked to lead them to a victory from behind.  Rosen actually delivered some bullets to move the offence just outside field goal range, but was intercepted on a good fourth down attempt. The week after that he was named the starter and he hasn‚Äôt left the lineup ever since.  In his first start ever against the Seahawks I saw some impressive stuff from the rook, delivering supremely accurate passes on all three levels, just threading the needle on a multitude of them, even though a bunch of them were dropped, knocked away late or ruled incomplete due to one foot not coming down in bounds.  He came up big for them on crucial situations and the only thing that held the Cardinals back from winning that game was their own coaching staff not allowing their young signal-caller to get it done late with his arm, but instead deciding to run the ball three straight times around the opposing 30-yard line and ultimately missing the go-ahead field goal, even though it was the rookie that led them down there.     The week after that Rosen got his first career win versus the 49ers and even though the numbers might not have been that good, he took good care of the ball and hooked up with rookie teammate Christian Kirk for a huge 75-yard touchdown for the game‚Äôs first score.  Over the next two games, the team took a huge bump, as they lost by ten at the Vikings and were blown out 45-10 at home by the Broncos.  Rosen threw just one touchdown and four picks during that stretch, but I thought the numbers didn‚Äôt really tell the truth. Especially against the Broncos I thought he played much better than those horrendous stats indicated.  On his first pick-six the ball was batted up in the air at the line and on the second one the wideout inexplicably just stopped running on a slant route. Outside of that third one in the fourth quarter, when he just tried to force a big play to Kirk at last, Rosen was on time and target on curls, hooks, comebacks and other timing-based routes.      Following that demolition the Cardinals finally decided to fire their Offensive Coordinator Mike McCoy. It was not just Sam Bradford early on that willingly checked the ball down to his backs over and over again without even trying to look downfield, but also McCoy‚Äôs conservative play-calling that hindered his rookie quarterback.  The run design lacked creativity in a big way, being limited to simple dive and ISO plays for the most part, there were no vertical stretches of the defense and he just could not find ways to put the ball into the hands of the few of playmakers they had in space.  Moreover, the supporting cast for the Cards might have been even worse than the Bills‚Äô. They are dead-last in yards after the catch, barely cracking the 1000-yard mark. In comparison to that ‚Äì the 49ers have almost double that amount despite playing with a backup QB and limitations at the skill spots as well.      However what really stands out about McCoy‚Äôs stint in Arizona is the way he could not put his best player David Johnson in position to succeed. Before DJ missed almost all of last season, there might have been two guys I would have taken above him if you made me choose a running back.  Yet, in seven games under their ex-OC he was limited to 72 yards from scrimmage per game on an average of just 18 touches, giving him less than four yards per touch. This has also led to the lowest number in time of possession at 26:17 a game, as they have gained an average of just 4.6 first downs on the ground. While the offense has improved to some degree under Byron Leftwich, I think it is almost unfair to evaluate Rosen like the other guys, because not only the players around him on offense but also the play-calling for large stretches has been so incredibly bad.      He is ranked among the bottom five in percentage of third downs converted via the pass, but he has faced a large amount of third-and-long situations. When it was third-and-eight or more he has completed 28.9 percent of his passes.  I still love Rosen‚Äôs touch and internal confidence. He is extremely smart and not afraid to let it rip. If you look beyond the numbers and win totals, even though they won at Lambeau field two weeks ago, you see some franchise quarterback traits.  The organization just needs to surround Rosen with more playmakers and make things easier with coordinator help. #5 Lamar Jackson Early on Jackson was used as a gadget player, coming in to run zone-reads, designed quarterback keeps, throw a couple of passes or just be a decoy for opposing defences     I truly believe Lamar Jackson is the closest thing we have had seen to Michael Vick since his days with the Falcons and Eagles.  When the Ravens decided to move back up into the first round of April‚Äôs draft to select the former Heisman trophy winner with the 32nd pick, the organization made a structural and philosophical decision, but they also knew they still had Joe Flacco on their books for this season and only then they could make the call on what they will do going forward.  Early on Jackson was used as a gadget player, coming in to run zone-reads, designed quarterback keeps, throw a couple of passes or just be a decoy for opposing defenses. When it was announced that Flacco would miss the first game after their by week, the rookie stepped into the starting lineup.  Entering at a 4-5 record, Baltimore only now lost their first game with the rookie as the starter ‚Äì and that came by three points to the top-seeded Chiefs following a 3-0 start to Lamar‚Äôs career.      With Flacco back to fully participating and the Ravens deciding to go with Jackson against Tampa Bay this weekend, a new era has officially started in Charm City. The biggest difference with Jackson in the starting lineup has been the improvement of the rushing attack. I crunched the numbers and the team‚Äôs difference between their attempts, yards and averages are astonishing.  Through the first nine weeks with Flacco under center, the Ravens on average ran the ball 27 times a game for 103.8 yards, giving them an average of 3.85 yards per carry.  These last four games with the rookie taking over however, they are running the ball 46 times for 228.5 yards and 4.97 yards per carry.  That comparison is just absolutely ridiculous, giving Baltimore the league‚Äôs best marks in totals and attempts, while being right up there with the elite in average yards as well despite that run-pass ratio.  Obviously a lot of that has to do with the rookie quarterback amassing 475 total yards on the ground himself on 5.0 yards a clip and surpassing 70 yards in every game as a starter, but this goes beyond his numbers alternating their overall production.     The threat of Jackson pulling the ball on zone-reads or simply booting the other way off handoffs is so frightening for defenses that it hurts their backside help on running plays on many occasions.  Not only do they obviously have to keep the last man at the line of scrimmage leverage outside the quarterback to force him to hand the ball off, a lot of times that backside linebacker can not flow with the play whatsoever and this allows even easier cutback opportunities for the Ravens‚Äô backs compared to if that guy just overran the play.  Fellow rookie running back Gus Edwards only entered the scene once Jackson took over and while I don‚Äôt want to take any credit away from him, his 95.5 rushing yards a game and five yards per attempt and Kenneth Dixon‚Äôs six yards per rush these last two weeks have a lot to do with who is running the play-fakes.      As far as straight-line speed goes I don‚Äôt think anybody is up to par with Jackson and he just seems to freeze defenders when he takes off. Obviously he will need to protect his body better going forward, but he will learn that. People who think Jackson just wants to scramble haven‚Äôt watched the tape, because 418 of his 475 yards have come on designed runs. He is looking to throw the ball and sometimes you feel like he almost should take off with his athletic ability.  The overall passing numbers are pedestrian at 25 attempts for 150 yards per game and four touchdowns compared to three interceptions.  Outside of a big run-and-catch play to fellow rookie tight-end Mark Andrews, Jackson hasn‚Äôt really provided the element of the deep passing attack, but he has done enough through the air to keep his offense on schedule.  The rookie out of Louisville might not have the fastball some of these other guys on the list have, but he has a whippy arm and he is comfortable throwing it on the run.      Jackson has come up with big, timely completions from the pocket as well as off schedule at the end of halves and on third downs. What is very unique about him is how we can move defenders one way with how he moves and then comes back the other way to one of his pass-catchers. Jackson still has to work a lot on his ability to pick defenses apart from the pocket, as he prefers to manipulate defenders with his movement to create clear looks for himself and as of right now he has the second-lowest adjusted completion percentage among all starting quarterbacks, but he just plays winning football.  Through four games, the rookie QB is 21 of 44 converting with his arm and legs on third and fourth downs (47.7%) and when the yardage to gain is at five or under, he is 13 of 20. Obviously he went against a few below-average defenses in the Bengals, Raiders, Falcons and Chiefs, but he also came through in the clutch for his team and battled it out with MVP front-runner Patrick Mahomes at a hostile place in Arrowhead.  With him in the lineup, Baltimore can be the team that they are built to be ‚Äì which means controlling the clock with their ground game, as they average 35:52 minutes in terms of time of possession, and get after it with a rested defense.

The Washington Redskins agreed to trade for quarterback Alex Smith from the Kansas City Chiefs in late January thus resetting the QB market even before the season ended. Two teams already had two new quarterbacks before the Eagles could beat out the defending champions in February.  The trade freed the embattled ex-Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins to sign with the Minnesota Vikings in Free agency. The Vikings, who made it to the NFC Championship game, had three starting-caliber quarterbacks and let them all hit the free agency and signed Cousins to a first-ever full guaranteed contract.        Weeks prior to the start of free agency it was obvious that the Cousins-Vikings marriage is inevitable, which prompted the MVP of Vikings season Case Keenum to struck a deal with Denver Broncos even before the Cousins deal was finalized. This Keenum deal started the domino effect with many teams that are in the QB market started making deals.           Cleveland Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor from the Buffalo Bills, one of many trades they made this offseason. Arizona Cardinals signed Sam Bradford, New York Jets Signed Teddy Bridgewater and then traded him to the New Orleans Saints after an amazing preseason. AJ McCarron signed with the Bills and got beat out by rookie Josh Allen to become the starter which prompted the Bills to trade him to Oakland. Speaking of rookies, the 2018 draft had as many as Five QBs taken in round 1. By Week 4, four of the 5 are starting and the fifth QB is already seeing some game action in trick plays.     Including both the Veterans and Rookies, there are as many as Eight teams who had new Quarterbacks starting for them this year. Let's take a look at how these QBs fared so far with their new teams. Let's start with a Bonus player, the man who took the league by surprise and then crash landed in week 4:  BONUS: Ryan Fitzpatrick (2-2)  Oh, where to start. When I first started to think about this article after week 2, I had him competing for the number 1 spot with the current number 1 and then week 4 happened and the head coach Dirk Koetter has announced that Jameis Winston will be starting after the week 5 bye.     Since, FitzMagic is just a placeholder for Winston, who was serving his 3-game suspension, I decided not to include him in the rankings but thought he deserved a shout-out for his performance through the first three weeks. He went 2-2 in his starts when no one expected him to be anything better than 1-3. He faced three playoff teams from last year and went 2-1 in those games and came close to being 3-0 while trying to make an epic comeback against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 3. He posted 400 yards in each of his first three games, an NFL record. But week 4 proved why Fitzpatrick is who he is, a journeyman quarterback. The four-game stretch should help him get more money in the next offseason and will be a highly paid backup QB. #8 Josh Rosen/Sam Bradford, Arizona Cardinals (0-4)      Two teams have already started two quarterbacks who were not on their roster last season, one of them is Arizona Cardinals. Cardinals, who saw both their quarterback and head coach retire after last season had a complete overhaul in coaching and QB room. The added three quarterbacks including Mike Glennon. Sam Bradford, who is coming off injuries, signed a 1 year 20 million dollar contract and became a presumed starter. But, the Cardinals are off to a terrible start losing out in all the three starts prompting the change to go with the rookie Josh Rosen. Bradford in his three starts completed 62.5% of his passes for 400 yards and two touchdowns. But, he also had four INTs to his name. Bradford, couldn't move the ball well under Mike McCoy's game plan. He struggled in the first 2 games where the offense only scored 6 points in total. He started off well in the Week 3 matchup against the Chicago Bears where he tossed two TDs to start the game, but then couldn't find the momentum in the rest of the game which paved the way for the rookies Josh Rosen to come in the fourth quarter and try to win the game which was a very close contest.         Rosen was named starter for week 4 and quietly had an impressive debut. Rosen probably threw for only 180 yards but kept the Cardinals in the game without making any stupid mistakes. Cardinals eventually lost to the Russell Wilson's Seahawks, but had a glimpse of their bright future. The Cardinals running game needs to be picked up. The O-line has been one of the worst in the league, which handcuffed one of the elite tailbacks in David Johnson.     This Cardinals offense reminds me of 2016 Rams team which made Todd Gurley, Jared Goff and Case Keenum do nothing. This Cardinals offense is doing the same to David Johnson, Josh Rosen and Larry Fitzerald. Look for a coaching change to come this off season even though it is the first season as a head coach for Steve Wilks, at the very least the OC needs to be changed. With the correct play caller, this offense is capable of some high flying action ala Chiefs, Rams and the Texans. #7 Josh Allen/Nathan Peterman, Buffalo Bills (1-3)      Buffalo Bills had one of the strangest QB competition in NFL this offseason. They had three quarterbacks in the battle for the starting spot during the training camp. All thought that it would be AJ McCarron but instead as the preseason approached McCarron became third stringer and expendable, thus his trade to Raiders. The Bill surprisingly announced Nathan Peterman over the rookie Josh Allen as the starter for week 1, but Peterman repeated his first start performance from last year when he threw for 5 picks. He threw 2 picks and scored nothing, which led for the rookie Josh Allen to take the reigns. Allen in his three starts the next three weeks, completed only 53.4% of passes throwing just two touchdowns with four picks. His best game came in week 3 when the Buffalo Bills stunned the world by beating the Minnesota Vikings. Allen had three total TDs, 2 of them coming on the ground, showing off his athleticism in that game. But, he came back to earth in week 4, throwing 2 picks against an average Packers defense.     Allen, as expected, is raw and playing like a typical rookie. In an ideal scenario, he could use a redshirt season before taking over the reigns like Patrick Mahomes, but he did not have the luxury of learning under someone like Alex Smith, instead, the situation has thrust him into starting role early. He is going to have some growing pains but if week 3 is any indication he is going to be big in long term. #6 Baker Mayfield/Tyrod Taylor, Cleveland Browns (1-2-1)      This is the second team in the list that already had two starters who were not on the roster last season. The Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor during the offseason. A month later the Browns picked Baker Mayfield with the number 1 overall pick. Mayfield was supposed to be redshirted this season with Taylor holding the place for the year at least until the Browns are out of Playoff contention. But with Taylor's concussion in Week 3 Thursday Night matchup against the Jets, Mayfield came in late second quarter and helped Browns mount the comeback and give the franchise its first win in 17 games. Browns had a great start to the season, mostly thanks to the defense which stifled Ben Roethlisberger in Week 1. Drew Brees also had a tough time playing against this defense. Browns started 0-1-1 in the first two weeks and entered week 3 as favorites for the first time in almost two seasons.     Tyrod Taylor apart from a couple of plays had a tough start to his Browns tenure. That bad form continued in week 3. The first half of that game was unwatchable with Tyrod under center. But, when Mayfield came into the game, the dynamics changed. Browns offense is fun to watch after a very long time, He made the plays that Tyrod Taylor would hesitate to do.     Mayfield brought the life back into the Browns fans. The stadium was lit during the Second Half. That Second Half started a new era in Cleveland Football History. Mayfield was named a starter for Week 4 and beyond as expected. On his first start though Mayfield came back to earth against the Oakland Raiders.     Mayfield threw for two touchdowns but also had four turnovers which resulted in 21 Raiders points. Mayfield showed off his athletic skills, but also showed it was premature to make him a HOF player after that amazing second half in week 3. It is going to be interesting to see how the Browns and Mayfield will continue the rest of the way in all of a sudden new look AFC North that has Steelers tied at the bottom of the table instead of the top. #5 Sam Darnold, New York Jets (1-3)      Darnold was the only rookie quarterback who was named the starting quarterback prior to week 1. He had to earn the job in a battle with Teddy Bridgewater. Both Darnold and Bridgewater had a good preseason leading the Jets to trade Bridgewater to Saints and announce Darnold as a starter. Unlike other rookies, Darnold had an impressive start to his career. He completed 76% of his passes for 198 yards, 2 TDs and a pick with an impressive 116.8 rating. But after that, he came back crashing to earth. He had 4 more INTs to only 2 TDs in the remaining three games.         Darnold had his first career game without any interception in week 4 against a very good Jacksonville Jaguars defense. That should be considered a minor victory for a rookie QB who is struggling after a strong start. Unlike other quarterbacks, Darnold isn't surrounded by high flying talent. His receivers and the running backs are well below league average. In order to succeed long-term, the Jets need to provide weapons around him as the Bears did with Mitchell Trubisky this year, which helped him go off in week 4. Quincy Enunwa and the receivers need to step up and help the rookie QB to have any shot this year. Patriots, who had a slow start are getting back their groove right in time with Julian Edelman returning from his suspension. Jets will be facing a tough Denver defense in week 5. if Darnold could escape that game without a Turnover, they could have a very good chance to escape with a W. He could take some pointer from his veteran backup and mentor Josh McCown.     #4 Alex Smith, Washington Redskins (2-1)  Alex Smith has been his typical self to start the 2018 season with his new team the Washington Redskins. He has a completed nearly 70% of his passes and scored 4 Touchdowns with a pick and a 2-1 record. That is a typical Alex Smith stat line. Smith had a good start for his redskins tenure against the Cardinals, where he threw for 255 yards and a couple of TDs. But, in week 2 against a mediocre Colts defense Smith couldn't find the endzone even though completing nearly 72% of his passes. He and the Redskins bounced back in week 3 against the Packers where he outplayed Rodgers to upset the Packers.     Smith success correlates with the success of the running game. in the two wins, the Redskins new running back, Adrian Peterson rushed for nearly hundred yards and has scored a TD at least once, in the loss against the Colts he rushed 11 times for just 20 yards. Smith is one of those QBs who needs all the dominoes around him should work efficiently to find the success. He does not commit any back-breaking mistakes but he does not even get you out of the gate if fallen behind. NFC East is vulnerable right now and Redskins sit on top of the division even with their bye on week 4. The one difference between the Chiefs and the Redskins is that they lack that dynamic pass catcher that could help a QB out. Jordan Reed had some success in the wins but Jamison Crowder has yet to find the rhythm. It will be interesting to see if Smith can help out the Redskins to remain on top of a very close NFC East race as he did with the Chiefs the past few Seasons.     #3 Case Keenum, Denver Broncos (2-2)  Case Keenum, an undrafted free agent out of the University of Houston, had one of the most unprecedented journeys to become the starting quarterback of Denver Broncos. After his amazing career year in 2017 with the Vikings, Keenum signed a 2 year 36 million dollar contract with the Broncos. But, so far Keenum was not able to replicate the kind of success he had last season. Keenum had a total of 7 INTs in 2017 season has already thrown for 6 so far in four games and just tossing three touchdowns. Keenum's decision making at times seem erratic. He is trying to do more than what the defenses are giving him.     Even with his erratic play Keenum found some early success in the first two weeks by having two clutch game winning drives, which Broncos did not have last season. He almost had a third game winning drive on the MNF, week 4 against the Chiefs. He overthrew a wide open Demaryius Thomas which could have resulted in a game winning TD. In the next play he did connect to the rookie Courtland Sutton in an old-school hook and ladder play call.         Keenum, just like Smith is a game manager who needs to have a better player all around him. He has a solid running game with the two rookies, Royce Freeman and Phillip Lindsay sharing the work load, but the receivers apart from Emmanuel Sanders haven't really stepped up. The reason for having Keenum just a tick above the Last year with Vikings Keenum had Thielen and Diggs who had some amazing catches that helped out Keenum. Keenum knows that Demaryius Thomas is no longer in that elite group and need to be more careful forcing the ball into the tight coverage. The reason I have Keenum a tick above Alex Smith is that of his Clutch performance in weeks 1 and 2 and his NFC Championship game appearance just a few months back. I still think that Keenum is an upgrade to what Denver had last season and could help them have a fighting chance to at least grab the Wildcard spot in the playoffs.     There is no panic yet in Denver, there is a lot of season left and with no viable back up option left this will be Keenum's Season. If he can clean up the turnovers, this Denver team could be in hunt for a playoff spot in December. #2 Kirk Cousins, Minnesota Vikings (1-2-1)  Kirk Cousins, signed a monster contract with the Minnesota Vikings this offseason. After reaching the NFC Championship game a year ago with Keenum under center, the expectations very sky high for the Vikings fans. Some even considered this a Superbowl or bust move.     If indeed it is a Superbowl or bust move, the Vikings are off to a terrible start. They opened the season with a W against the 49ers but tied it up in week 2 with the Packers thanks to some head-scratching roughing the passer penalties. But the real stunner cam in Week 3 when Vikings and Cousins looked almost clueless against a bad Buffalo Bills team who scored a combined 23 points in the remaining three games. Cousins was shutout for three quarters, he had a couple of strip sacks an INT and it was late in the 4Q that he tossed a TD almost in garbage time. Apart from that one week, Cousins was his usual self he completed nearly 70% of his passes, tossing 10 Touchdowns and just 2 picks. He has 1,387 yards in just 4 games and yet the record is 1-2-1 record.         Cousins tenure so far remained same like his Redskins tenure where he played very well when was not pressured too much. But, when pressured his performance goes down. In 2018 so far his rating when the pocket is clean was 112.2, but when he is pressured it dramatically drops down to 89.8. Cousins even brought his fumbling issue from Redskins to Vikings, in which he is second most to fumble the ball since 2015. The Vikings O-line performance has been masked by Keenum's athleticism last season of avoiding the sacks, which Cousins clearly lacks. If Vikings need to find success with Cousins under center they need to provide a clean pocket and give him time to make the plays that Keenum couldn't have done last season. The NFC North looks very interesting with Chicago Bears on Top with Packer right next to them. If the Vikings need to be in the Playoffs in a very tough NFC they need to keep teh pocket clean for Cousins.     #1 Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs (4-0)  Patrick Mahomes is not a new player that was signed or added this offseason but he is the new starter for the Kansas City Chiefs after they traded Alex Smith to the Redskins. Mahomes did start in week 17 of last season but still, this is the first season as a full-fledged starter and thought he should be in this conversation. After the kind of start he had, he certainly should be.     Mahomes had one of the best starts since the Peyton Manning's record-breaking 2013 season. Mahomes even broke the Manning's record of 12 total touchdowns by tossing 13 through weeks 1-3. During the first three weeks, Mahomes was off to fast starts putting up 20+ points to start the game and make the opposing offenses play catchup to the Chiefs. The real test for Mahomes came in week 4 against a very good Broncos defense in a very rowdy Denver environment in Monday Night Prime-time slot. He had a slow start where Denver's defense had his number during the first three quarters. But he remained calm and made some timely passes in the fourth quarter resulting in one of the most thrilling matches in 2018 season so far.         The most amazing fact about Mahomes' performance so far in 2018 is that he has yet to throw an interception. In his four starts this season he has 15 touchdowns and zero picks. This INT-less streak should be attributed to his redshirt year in 2017 under Alex Smith. There is no better player to learn from how to remain interception-free. Mahomes performance so far is a reminiscence of Deshaun Watson's performance for Houston Texans last season. Mahomes is bound to be regressed in coming weeks, which could happen very well in week 5 against a very strong Jaguars defense, who allowed only a total of 4 touchdowns. The sky is the limit for Mahomes and this Kansas City offense. All they could ask for is the defense to play some average level play who currently are last in passing yards allowed. If the defense is not improved, a very good offensive season could very well be ruined come January. Mahomes, distanced himself from others atop of the MVP race, not a bad way to kickoff your first full season as a starting NFL QB. Let's hope the football gods spare Mahomes that bit the likes of Wentz and Watson last season during their own MVP campaigns.

Now having watched every single matchup, I came away with one observation for each NFL squad. Here's what you need to know            Oakland Raiders ‚Äì This Jon Gruden thing could go pretty wrong Unlike a lot of people, I wasn‚Äôt worried too much about Gruden not being able to adjust to the modern game and adapt different offensive schemes. I like the toughness he wants to install into his players, I think he has gained insight into different coaches with TV production meetings and I believe he is the type of flashy hire the Raiders needed after announcing they would move to Las Vegas. Regardless of all those factors, I have yet to see him display touch with this generation of players and his feel for the flow of a game in real-time. His comment about ‚Äúneeding a pass rush‚Äù after their loss to the Rams was almost comical and I thought it was pretty harsh to put all the blame on Khalil Mack for saying ‚Äú he didn‚Äôt want to be on the team‚Äù, but more importantly their offense got stuck in the mud after their portion of scripted plays and when it was time to react to how the game progressed.Tampa Bay Buccaneers ‚Äì Ryan Fitzpatrick might be the streakiest passer in NFL history     This was the biggest upset of the week and I don‚Äôt think there was anybody in the media who predicted that the Bucs could stun a popular Super Bowl pick at the Dome. However, nobody expected to see more Fitzmagic in this matchup either. The Harvard graduate has been a journeyman throughout his NFL career, having played and started for seven different franchises. He came to all but one team as a backup, but somehow always ended up in the starting lineup eventually. Fitzy has had some brilliant moments, like a six-touchdown outing against the Titans in 2014 after being benched by the Texans three weeks earlier and he set the Jets‚Äô franchise record for passing touchdown in a season with 31 in 2015, but plenty of times after those heroic performances, he has stunk the following week. Last Sunday was another one of those brilliant moments, when he played an almost perfect game and might have already started a quarterback controversy in Tampa     Atlanta Falcons ‚Äì Steve Sarkisian still is a horrific play-caller I don‚Äôt enjoy bashing coaches and calling for anybody‚Äôs job, but it‚Äôs just frustrating to watch this Falcons offense have so much talent and have it go to waste. I appreciate the fact that Sarkisian made it a priority to find ways to put the ball into the hands of his best player, but he just doesn‚Äôt seem to have a clear plan on how to feature his arsenal of playmakers. First-round pick Calvin Ridley didn‚Äôt catch a single pass, despite already being an outstanding route-runner and what he showed in preseason, plus the Eagles didn‚Äôt have anybody capable of covering Freeman or Coleman having without Nigel Bradham in the lineup. More importantly though, those red-zone trips were just embarrassing. For all the times Sark has been critiqued for not targeting Julio on the red-zone, he has tried to make up for it by zeroing in on number 11 in two games versus the Eagles, despite facing double-coverage constantly. At least he put him in a stack once to give him a free release, but you have to give the guys with one-on-one opportunities a chance.      Baltimore Ravens ‚Äì That defense is nasty This franchise has always been known for tough, physical defenses and last year they already looked like one of the dominant units for most of the year, as they led the league in takeaways and pitched three different shutouts throughout the season. With that being said, they might be even more terrifying in 2018 and they started things of right with a 47-3 hammering of the Buffalo Bills. The Baltimore front controlled the line of scrimmage the entire game and completely shut down the Bills‚Äô rushing attack, forcing Nathan Peterman to beat them with his arm. After throwing two picks and putting up a QB rating of 0.0 they sent out Josh Allen in the second half, but the only real success he had came on the ground, as he outrushed LeSean McCoy with 26 yards. That performance is even more impressive considering the Ravens were without their top cornerback in Jimmy Smith. Baltimore goes five guys deep at edge rusher, C.J. Mosley is a perennial Pro Bowler and their secondary is full of ball-hawks.     Buffalo Bills ‚Äì The Nathan Peterman era is over After finally reaching the playoffs for the first time in 20 years, the Bills were due to regress after trading quarterback Tyrod Taylor and drafting developmental prospects at quarterback and linebacker. They brought in A.J. McCarron to go with seventh overall pick Josh Allen, but decided to trade him a week before the regular season as they chose Nathan Peterman as their starter under center. We all remember the mistake they made pulling Tyrod for him last year, as he threw five picks in just the first half versus the Chargers and he had an even worse performance in the season-opener. Peterman completed 5 of his 18 pass attempts for 24 yards, no touchdowns, two interceptions and a QB rating of zero, while not picking up a single first down. The offensive line has been a mess as well and the pass-catcher haven‚Äôt really helped him out either, but I think the second-year man is only out there to take the hits until Josh Allen is ready to go.      Carolina Panthers ‚Äì A running Cam Newton scares defenses Outside of his MVP season Cam Newton averages a completion percentage of 59.4, 288 passing yards per game, 20.5 touchdowns a season and a quarterback rating of 83.2. Everybody who has been reading my blog for the last five years knows I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the Panthers quarterback and for detail on why you can read more of my content or ask me directly. With that being said ‚Äì boy, is that guy scary when he takes off. At 6‚Äô6‚Äù, 250 pounds Superman is as tough to bring down as anybody in the league and the Cowboys got to know that first hand once again on Sunday. Cam ran the ball 10 times for 58 yards and a touchdown, with all but one of those rushing attempts coming off zone-read plays or designed QB runs. The yardage total should even be six yards higher considering the Panthers ended the game by taking a knee three times for minus six yards. Cam is a beast as a runner and you always have to pay attention to him.     Chicago Bears ‚Äì This team is for real I know they just gave up a 20:0 lead, but I don‚Äôt want to hear anybody say that the Bears choked or anything like that. The offense moved the ball (even if they had to settle for field goals) even for most of the second half and they made Aaron Rodgers move around on a bad knee. They just were a victim of the game‚Äôs best QB smelling blood in the water. Matt Nagy is a genius play-caller, who understands how to use the new weapons with movement and misdirection. Tarik Cohen is his version of Tyreek Hill as a gadget player and Mitch Trubisky looks very comfortable in that offense. Khalil Mack was unreal with just one week of practice and this defensive front got after it. Akiem Hicks is a disruptive force and Roquan Smith‚Äôs first play in an NFL game ended up in a sack. This is a dangerous squad.      Cincinnati Bengals ‚Äì Joe Mixon is a playmaker When I looked at last week‚Äôs matchups and I saw Mixon would go up against the Colts defense, I already had him pencilled in as my RB1 for fantasy. Last year as a rookie, the former Oklahoma back was limited to 3.5 yards a carry behind a lacklustre offensive line, but with the additions of Duane Brown via trade and Billy Price in the draft, I expect a big season for the second-year man. A top-twenty talent a year ago, Mixon now with his mind set on the field, where he has looked like a tremendous all-around back in week one versus Indianapolis. Mixon amassed 149 yards from scrimmage on just 22 touches. He displayed balance, burst and power, but more importantly outstanding vision and patience. The screen game with him looked excellent and he has that Le‚ÄôVeon Bell-esque running style. With that being said, he will face a tough test tomorrow night versus Baltimore who held Shady to 22 yards on the ground Sunday.     Cleveland Browns ‚Äì The Browns still haven‚Äôt won a game I understand this is more of a fact than an observation, but let me explain to you what I mean with this. The Browns came into this game with as good a roster as they have had in several years and they were hungry for a W after an 0-16 campaign, especially against a team that had beaten them in 14 of their last 16 meetings. Over the course of the game the Steelers turned the ball over six times and basically handed the Browns the victory. Big Ben threw three picks in the first half, but none of them ended in points for Cleveland. Up 21-7 in the middle of the fourth quarter, they capitalized off a fumble recovery at the PIT one-yard line and having the ball at midfield almost off a punt. Having driven the ball down the field close to field goal range with less than half a minute left, Tyrod tossed an ill-advised pick to send them to overtime. After a series of three-and-outs and a missed Steelers field goal, Genard Avery‚Äôs strip-sack set them up for a 45-yard game-winner themselves, but they saw it blocked by T.J. Watt. I know it officially is a tie, but this was a moral loss for Cleveland, which could have kick-started a new chapter of their franchise‚Äôs history.      Dallas Cowboys ‚Äì Nobody on the outside is ready to win in the passing game Putting the ball into the hands of Zeke just 18 times simply won‚Äôt get it done. The Cowboys need to establish the running game, even without All-Pro center Travis Frederick, to set up opportunities to win on play-action. When Dallas is forced into obvious passing situations, there simply are no receivers, who can win consistently and Dak Prescott is not the type of guy, who will throw them open against man-coverage. On the final two drives of the game the Cowboys had opportunities to move the ball down the field by pushing it outside the numbers, but they counted on Deonte Thompson to make plays. Allen Hurns, Terrance Williams and rookie Michael Gallup all only caught one pass, while Cole Beasley kind of kept them alive by catching seven short passes out of the slot and turning most of them into first downs. The Cowboys better get this ground game going or this could be a long season.     Denver Broncos ‚Äì Von Miller is a freaking beast I originally wanted to talk about how this team is ready to win right now and that Chad Kelly might be the better option under center after Case Keenum almost cost them a win with his three interceptions on Sunday, but oh my god ‚Äì can Von Miller ball. That dude completely wrecked the Seahawks gameplan by recorded three sacks, four QB hurries and forcing two fumbles. He was chasing Russell Wilson around all game long and made Germain Ifedi look like trash. Von got one strip-sack off a stunt with Wilson stepping up into the pocket and the second one he came in from behind on Chris Carson and simply took the ball out of his hands like he was a little baby. This guy is a bad man, who has been wreaking havoc on quarterbacks around the league for seven years now and he is off to a good start to finally win a Defensive Player of the Year award.      Detroit Lions ‚Äì Matthew Stafford is one tough son of a gun I could talk about the four interceptions Stafford threw and they were all pretty bad. I could also talk about a Matt Patricia‚Äôs horrific start to his head coaching career and how his defense made a rookie quarterback look like Tom Brady on Monday night. Yet, I want people to appreciate the toughness Stafford displays constantly. He got knocked around like a rag doll and you saw him limping on and off the field. I thought at some point the coaches should have just pulled him out of the game, but he went to them again and again to say he wants to go out on the field. This was not the first time the Lions QB played through injury. I remember an incredible comeback win against the Browns as a rookie in 2009, when he took a huge shot and could barely move his left arm, but pushed the doctors aside to go back out for the game-winning TD. I also remember a narrow loss to the Panthers last year, when he had his whole leg taped up and blood running down his hand. Nothing will keep this man off the field ‚Äì not even his own medical staff.     Green Bay Packers ‚Äì Aaron Rodgers is the most dangerous man in football This is nothing new to me. Aaron Rodgers has pulled off stuff like this throughout the years and you can never count him and the Packers out, but it‚Äôs been a while since I last saw him work his magic. After being carted off and seeing his team go down by three touchdowns, it was time for the King of the North to take over once again. You could clearly tell that Rodgers had trouble moving and he was playing on guts, but he just carved that Bears defense up from the pocket. That bomb to the back of the end-zone to Geronimo Allison was amazing and I know Randall Cobb gained 65 yards of that 75-yard touchdown after the catch, but even that ability to understand how he will adjust his route where the ball has to be put was surgical. When you don‚Äôt put this man away, there is always a chance he will do unbelievable things.      Houston Texans ‚Äì Deshaun Watson is not totally back yet Deshaun Watson was so incredibly impressive in his injury-shortened rookie campaign that it was almost unfair to expect him to continue that trend in 2018. Going toe-for-toe with Tom Brady and Russell Wilson in shootouts on his way to scoring 20 touchdowns in six starts put him in the national spotlight before tearing his ACL in practice. In his much-anticipated return as a second-year player he didn‚Äôt look the same. Watson put his eyes down on the rush way too often instead of keeping them downfield to make plays. He showed a lack of decisiveness and accuracy down the field. Not only did he complete only 50 percent of his passes, he also threw a pretty bad pick when he was late and short on a deep ball to the end-zone. With that being said, he didn‚Äôt seem to have trouble moving around and he had his team in position to make a late comeback. So let‚Äôs see how quickly he can get back to himself mentally.     Indianapolis Colts ‚Äì Andrew Luck is finally back It was more than 600 days until we last saw Andrew Luck throw a pass in a regular NFL game and he did not disappoint in his comeback. The Colts‚Äô star quarterback didn‚Äôt look good at all in preseason, being late on some throws and simply being hesitant to pull the trigger when he needed to. On Sunday it was time for live competition and Luck was ready to go. He showed mobility, touch and arm strength to rifle in some passes over the middle. He scanned the entire field, showing that he can still process information and understand where to go with the ball. The 29-year old took a vicious cheap-shot to the head by a Bengals safety, but got right back up and went back to work. Luck converted 11 of 15 third downs, including a sack. He gave the Colts the element of the downfield passing back and would have had his team in position for one of his notorious game-winning drives, did Jack Doyle not fumble after a 3-and-15 conversion. Luck made some ill-advised decisions and still needs to get used to the speed of the game, but he looks like Andrew Luck again.      Jacksonville Jaguars ‚Äì They absolutely need to win with their run game and defense The good thing is that the Jags already did that last year, when they led the league in rushing and finished the season 2nd in both yards and points allowed defensively. With the addition of Andrew Norwell to their offensive line and some of the young players on defense gaining more experience, both areas could be even better and they need to be when you look at what they have in the passing game. I like their second-year receivers Dede Westbrook and Keelan Cole, plus I think Austin-Seferian Jenkins can be a mismatch as that flex tight-end, but how can you trust Blake Bortles? He completed 54.5 percent of his passes for 176 yards even though the Giants put everybody they could into the box. His best work came on scrambles. I won‚Äôt put that interception completely on him, because Donte Moncrief turned his head around way too early, allowing Janoris Jenkins to do so as well, but Bortles is not the guy you want to count on to win you games and Leonard Fournette get healthy soon.     Arizona Cardinals ‚Äì Sam Bradford is the check down king It‚Äôs nothing new that Sam Bradford likes to check the ball down underneath and even his then record-setting completion percentage of 71.6 back in 2016 felt like a product of throwing it short of the sticks on third downs constantly. Yet, this Sunday he took it to a different level. Bradford threw 13 underneath passes to his running backs with little room to run, leading to 9 of his 20 completions. I like to see quarterbacks throw it out hot to defeat blitzes and if nothing is there I‚Äôd rather see them check the ball down, but you need to stretch defences vertically and attack the entire field. I know it‚Äôs early and Bradford will have another couple of weeks to prove he can get it done, but eventually it‚Äôs time to put Josh Rosen out there because he (at times to a fault) isn‚Äôt afraid to push the ball down the field.      Kansas City Chiefs ‚Äì Tyreek Hill is by far the biggest homerun hitter in the NFL I almost feel bad for not talking about Patrick Mahomes, because he was amazing. Those sidearm throws, bombs down the field and overall control of the offence makes me question my playoff predictions already. Yet, I want to talk about a different young player, because Tyreek is just a freak. Ever since Hill came into the league in 2016 you knew he was a touchdown waiting to happen. He scored three 80+ yard return touchdowns to go with his nine scores on offence as a rookie. Last Sunday versus the Chiefs he once again proved he is the most electric big-play threat in the game. Hill started the day off with a 91-yard punt return touchdown, but ended the game with 171 yards and two touchdowns on offence as well, including another 58-yard catch-and-run play. You just can‚Äôt blink when you face this guy, because if you do he might already be gone.     Los Angeles Rams ‚Äì You can‚Äôt fall in love with the pass game This is such a talented team. The Rams are loaded at pretty much every single position outside of linebacker. They made some enormous additions on the defensive side of the ball and the offense might be most fun to watch with playmakers all over the yard and Sean McVay‚Äôs creative play-designs. And while I thought their slow start versus the Raiders was more about the lack of live reps than anything else, as they sat most of their starters throughout the preseason, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice one element of their game in particular ‚Äì they got pass-happy. The Rams started the game with a three-and-out before going down the field in consecutive pass plays and then putting the ball into the hands of Todd Gurley on a little touch-pass sweep for a 19-yard score. The following drive they threw it five times while Gurley only touched the ball twice to end the half with just eight-and-a-half minute of possession. Over the final 30 games they handed the ball off to Gurley 17 times, but at the start of the fourth quarter up 23-13 they went back to throwing the ball on eight of their nine plays. Todd Gurley is the engine that makes this offense go and they need to establish him to open up everything else.      Miami Dolphins ‚Äì Adam Gase can elevate an offense with average talent The Dolphins head coach got rid of guys like Jay Ajayi, Jarvis Landry, Mike Pouncey and Ndamokung Suh, who were all very good players but apparently didn‚Äôt fit in with the disciplined Gase. Instead he brought in locker-room guys like Danny Amendola, Frank Gore and Daniel Kilgore, who can help turn around the culture of his franchise. However, that lack of offensive firepower comes at a price when it comes to the talent-level. I think Kenyan Drake is a superstar in the making, but DeVante Parker has yet to show any consistency and Kenny Stills has been a very good number three receiver, who shouldn‚Äôt lead your team in yards. Outside of a badly placed ball on a fade route to rookie Mike Gesicki split out wide and an overthrown deep shot leading to interceptions I thought this offense moved the ball pretty well. They won with clever route-combinations and different alignments.     Minnesota Vikings ‚Äì This is a complete team When you think about the Vikings you think of defense first and deservedly so. That unit held Jimmy Garoppolo to 15 of 33 with one touchdown compared to three interceptions, having taken one of them to the house. More importantly they showed they can follow the gameplan, by keeping the defensive ends home against bootlegs and taking away easy completions. However, they got the job done offensively as well. The 84-million dollar man Kirk Cousins looked confident and has already established good connections with Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen, plus he has shown understanding of play design. Case Keenum had a magical year in 2018, but Cousins is a much better player. Also, Dalvin Cook is a special talent and even though he was limited to 2.5 yards per carry, he made things happen in the quick passing game with six catches for 55 yards.  New England Patriots ‚Äì Gronk is pretty much unstoppable one-on-one     We heard all about the lack of pass-catchers surrounding Brady as we have done in recent years with Brandin Cooks, Danny Amendola and Dion Lewis all gone, but as long as they have Rob Gronkowski they have that one guy who simply can‚Äôt be covered by one man. Throughout the all-world tight-end‚Äôs career there have been very few guys, who have been able to at least slow him and it has really only been those big hits from Bernard Pollard and Earl Thomas that made him less of a locomotive in the middle of the field. Last Sunday the Texans were tasked to come up with a strategy to make Brady‚Äôs number one weapon less effective and they just couldn‚Äôt find a way. They played straight-up, put safeties on him, moved linebacker Zach Cunningham to the outside and shaded him with a safety over the top, but nothing worked. Gronk still ended up with seven catches for 123 yards.     Los Angeles Chargers ‚Äì These guys just can‚Äôt start fast I might have made a mistake. I predicted the Chargers would win 12 games and earn the AFC‚Äôs number one seed. What I forgot or rather what I blindly trusted would change was the fact this team simply can‚Äôt beat the Chiefs (now having lost the last nine meetings) and they don‚Äôt get out of the gates running. Yes, they were without Joey Bosa and yes, Antonio Gates still needs to find his way back, but this team made mistakes in all facets of the game. Philip Rivers threw a crucial pick in field-goal range in the third quarter, they didn‚Äôt run the ball often enough, the defense gave up seven plays of 20+ yards, they allowed a punt return touchdown over the entire field to Tyreek Hill and they still can‚Äôt convert field goals when they really matter, as Caleb Sturgis missed a 48-yarder when the Chargers still had more than a minute and all three timeouts left. I still believe in this team because they are so damn talented, but they better get started because Kansas City looks explosive.      New York Jets ‚Äì Sam Darnold is the Jets‚Äô saviour I had four blue-chip players at the top of my draft board, who I thought were can‚Äôt-miss guys, but right behind them I had Darnold, who also was my clear-cut number one QB and I feel pretty good about that right now. The rookie out of USC already looked very impressive when I watched his preseason tape, with how quickly he diagnosed coverages and processed information. He just doesn‚Äôt seem to get fooled by disguises and doesn‚Äôt show any hesitation when defenses change post-snap, but instead he just simply knows how to adjust and where to go with the ball. Outside of the anticipatory skills and his toughness, it was his even keel attitude that made me believe in him as a pro. That‚Äôs why I thought tossing that pick-six when trying to squeeze in a wheel route to the running back across the field was a perfect start to his career in the sense that you can see how he will respond. He went on to complete 16 of his 20 passes, while going four for four on third downs for 72 yards plus another conversion with his feet. The defense was unbelievable, but finally having that franchise quarterback is the key for Gang Green.      Philadelphia Eagles ‚Äì This team can win ugly games Carson Wentz will likely be out for another couple of weeks and no matter what anybody says, Nick Foles is not nearly as good. People forget that the Eagles defense gave up 20 points per game and they averaged just over 100 yards rushing until their bye in week nine last season. A lot of weight was on the shoulders of their young signal-caller, who I had as my MVP favorite until he got hurt versus the Rams. He was tremendous at producing big plays and keeping drives alive on third downs. The defense was pretty dominant throughout the playoffs at home and Nick Foles played the best football of his career, but they couldn‚Äôt do anything to stop Tom Brady until Brandon Graham‚Äôs strip-sack and I analyzed the brilliant offensive play-calling that made Foles‚Äô job a lot easier. However, in an opening game where the offense looked sloppy their ferocious D-line took over and they emerged victorious, buying Wentz some time to fully recover.      Pittsburgh Steelers ‚Äì The Le‚ÄôVeon Bell drama is in full swing I could talk about Big Ben‚Äôs ridiculous struggles on the road or T.J. Watt‚Äôs monster game of four sacks and the blocked field goal at the end of the game, but we all know what is on every Steelers‚Äô fans mind right now ‚Äì is Le‚ÄôVeon Bell worth the distractions? This is not Bell‚Äôs fault primarily since Pittsburgh has been the most-drama filled franchise in the NFL for a couple of years now. All the on-field antics, contract disputes and media news have felt like a reality show more so than a professional football team at times. Bell‚Äôs contract status has been discussed all offseason and he has yet to show at the team‚Äôs facility or sign his franchise tender. To me, he is the best all-around back in football, but the Steelers clearly don‚Äôt see him as part of their future at his price tag. James Conner‚Äôs outstanding performance of 192 scrimmage yards and two TDs certainly won‚Äôt quiet down the noise and at this point, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see Bell traded.     San Francisco 49ers ‚Äì Jimmy G is not invincible Everybody knew that Jimmy Garoppolo couldn‚Äôt stay undefeated forever, but with this statement I refer more to the fact that a good gameplan and the players to execute it can give the young signal-caller trouble. His completion-percentage of 45 percent and the fact he went three for eight on third downs are especially underwhelming when you consider some of the genius offensive scheming by Kyle Shanahan. Garoppolo‚Äôs job was made much easier being given easy dumpoffs off bootlegs, clever play-designs that included fake pick-plays and wide open crossing routes off misdirection. Of his three interceptions he overthrew one of his receivers, who fell down on a curl route, put a slant above the pads and he basically ended the game by trying to force the ball down the seam against triple-coverage. I still like him a lot going forward, which I described in my analysis of him once he signed his big contract, but this was a wakeup call.      Seattle Seahawks ‚Äì Germain Ifedi can not hang in there Von Miller had himself a day versus those Seahawks. He recorded three sacks, four hurries and two forced fumbles. The Broncos knew what they were doing however, because most of those numbers came rushing off the left end versus Germain Ifedi. Von had single-digit rushes against Duane Brown, who was holding his own, but he just killed the Hawks right tackle. One sack came off a stunt with the tight-end chipping him and his second fumble happened a couple of yards downfield when Miller simply took it away from Chris Carson. But Back to Ifedi ‚Äì I know it‚Äôs a very tough assignment because Von still is the premiere edge rusher in the NFL, but that was an embarrassing showing and it‚Äôs not like Sunday was the first time we‚Äôve seen that from Ifedi. He has been one of the worst starting offensive linemen in the league since he was drafted in 2015. He constantly overextended and leaned outside his frame, putting himself into horrible positions on Sunday.      Tennessee Titans ‚Äì This team could be in a lot of injury trouble There were a few things I came away with after the Titans week one game, like Marcus Mariota still staring down some of his receivers and not getting off his primary read or the defense being tricked easily on some plays, but with the bad luck they have had in terms of injuries, this was my main observation. In almost seven hours from the kickoff the Titans saw Marcus Mariota leave the game with a banged up elbow, Taylor Lewan entering concussion protocol after taking a cheap-shot and Delanie Walker being carted off the field with a dislocated ankle. Add to that the fact that Taylor Lewan is still recovering from a torn ACL and an offense that I thought could really shine under the lead of new offensive coordinator Matt LaFleur might be very limited at least for a certain period of time. Let‚Äôs hope they are healthy soon again.      Washington Redskins ‚Äì The O-line is nasty and AP could have another huge year I surprised some people when I said the Redskins had one of the top ten combinations of offensive and defensive line back in June. They were constantly reshuffling along both fronts last season, especially on the offensive side of the ball. However, when they are at 100 percent they are punishing people. I think Trent Williams is the best left tackle in football, Brandon Scherff is a Pro Bowl guard, Chase Roullier‚Äôs mobility at center gives them another dimension and they just work extremely well together. In the process, I think Adrian Peterson could have a major resurgence, because he will have running room and he moved like a 25-year old out there. Up 21-nothing at halftime, Washington pounded the ball on 42 rush attempts for 182 yards. Plus they ran a screen pass to AP that went for 52 yards and would have closed the game if there was no fumble.

New England Patriots QB Cam Newton feels that he deserves to be the starter in Week 1 Cam Newton played great football before contracting COVID-19. After returning from his quarantine, Newton looked sluggish, and something didn't feel right. Newton's performance led the Patriots to draft Mac Jones.     Since selecting Mac Jones, Bill Belichick has been bombarded with questions about who will be the starter. Belichick has mentioned Cam Newton as the starter more than Jones. Everyone knows that Belichick's words are never final, and he always has a plan. Mac Jones throwing people open like a vet. üò≥ pic.twitter.com/L6pB0ER7qs‚Äî Jim Nagy (@JimNagy_SB) August 29, 2021 The New England Patriots are in the same position as the Chicago Bears. Cam Newton is a veteran with experience, and Mac Jones is a rookie who could benefit from a year off. Mac Jones had the better preseason, but is that something Belichick will trust? It's hard to judge a rookie's success in the preseason when they're playing against backups.     The Patriots quarterback situation has a familiar feel to it. Cam Newton is the safe choice to start at quarterback for the Patriots. If Newton begins to struggle, the Patriots will not hesitate to put Jones in the game. Let's not forget that Brady only appeared in one game during his rookie season before becoming the starter after Bledsoe's injury. Cam Newton feels like Drew Bledsoe, and Mac Jones feels like Tom Brady. Obviously, Mac Jones isn't anywhere near Tom Brady talent-wise, but his situation is similar to that of an young Brady. The longer Bill Belichick takes on making a quarterback decision, the better it looks for Cam Newton. Belichick will likely keep Newton as the starting quarterback. Mac Jones will follow in Brady's footsteps to take over the Patriots during his second season in the NFL.The Patriots can only hope that Cam Newton can stay healthy, and when Jones takes over, he can bring the same success as Tom Brady.     "", 'Cam Newton could retire from the NFL  Former NFL MVP Cam Newton could have played his last down in the NFL. Having struggled for game time and performance over the last couple of seasons, he was benched for Sam Darnold this season as he threw four touchdowns and five interceptions in his five games this year.  Newton spoke to Jonathan Jones of CBS Sports and was asked if he had any football left in him.        ""Do I have a lot of football [left]? Do I want to play? Yeah,"" he said. ""But under the right conditions. I have to sit down with my family, my counsel, and just decide.""           Jonathan Jones@jjones9Cam Newton: Do I have a lot of football [left]? Do I want to play?

Over the next couple of weeks, NFL teams will be evaluating their rosters and looking at where they can improve. There are several teams that could use a new quarterback, but will a 32-year-old be the answer?     Washington need a new quarterback; so do the Steelers and the Texans (if Mills is not the answer), and potentially the Seahawks, depending on what Russell Wilson does. The Panthers are still unsure over their options going forward. Sam Darnold started 3-0 this season before the wheels fell off and Cam looked shaky in the offense. Nick Carboni@NickCarboniWCNCCam Newton says he\'s healthy, and is willing to accept a backup role in the right situation, for a winning-type team:""I\'m not coming back for no 5-12. I can tell you that now.""#NFL I @wcnc I #Panthers3:26 AM ¬∑ Jan 11, 2022529 The big question will be whether Newton sees himself as a starter or if he is content being a back-up. His charisma and stature suggest he needs to be a starter, but there could be only a handful of jobs available, if any; so being a back up could be a viable option.     Since his 2015 MVP season, in which he led the Panthers to a 15-1 record and a Super Bowl appearance, Cam has been on a downwards trajectory. In his MVP year, he threw for 35 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions, but he has not gotten close to those touchdown numbers since. Several teams will see the 32-year-old as a bonafide back-up option should their starter go down. That could even be in Carolina, but the lack of on-field production will cause some hesitation. If Cam is to call it a day and retire from the league, he will go down as one of the most polarizing figures the game has seen.

', ""How many college football programs did Cam Newton play for?  Despite the ups and downs, Cam Newton had one of the most illustrious college careers among NFL players. Despite being one of the best quarterbacks to have ever played professional football, Newton's college career didn't go as smoothly as one would expect.  Newton played his four-season college football career with three different programs from 2007 to 2010. The quarterback was fazed by issues that required him to switch colleges. However, he ended his college career as a Heisman Trophy winner and led Auburn to the national title in 2010 before becoming the No. 1 pick in the 2011 draft.        Wesley Sinor@WesleySinorCam Newton throws at Auburn Pro Day 2023983193           Newton began his college football career with the Florida Gators in 2007. He was recruited as a backup to the established Tim Tebow, the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner and a two-time All-American who led Florida to two national titles. Newton was able to showcase his talent despite his status as a backup. He performed well in the five games he played as a freshman. However, Newton's time at Florida was short-lived after he was arrested on felony charges after stealing a laptop from another student on campus in 2008. Those chargers were later dropped. Newton left Florida before reportedly facing possible expulsion on academic issues.     theScore@theScoreCam Newton reflects on 2008 arrest in Instagram post. thesco.re/2B19mT4308 Newton spent the following year at Blinn College, a junior college in Texas. He led the Blinn Buccaneers to the junior college national championship with a perfect 12-0 record. His performance was noticed by several universities. Newton signed with the Auburn Tigers in 2010 over Oklahoma and Mississippi State. As the starting quarterback, Newton had a phenomenal year at Auburn, leading them to a 13-0 record and the national championship. He also won the Heisman Trophy. Newton's college career roundup     Cam Newton with the Carolina Panthers Cam Newton's college career is undoubtedly noteworthy. The quarterback won numerous accolades, especially in the 2010 season with the Auburn Tigers. Aside from the Heisman Trophy, he was also awarded the Maxwell Award, Walter Camp Award and Manning Award. In his college career, Newton threw for 5,741 yards and 52 touchdowns with 12 interceptions. The dynamic quarterback also rushed for 2,241 yards and 40 touchdowns. Newton also recorded an impressive 62.9% pass completion rate in 628 attempts.While his time at Florida was brief and overshadowed by issues, his astounding success at Blinn College and Auburn cemented his status as one of the greatest quarterbacks in college football history. Newton is definitely a College Football Hall of Fame candidate.     "", 'Anthony Richardson vs Cam Newton: Comparing Gators QB\'s combine performance against former Auburn star  Anthony Richardson is one of the most polarizing prospects of the 2023 NFL draft. The former Florida Gators quarterback is touted as a first-round quarterback, but there are doubts about whether his skills will be able to translate to the NFL.  Richardson\'s performance at the 2023 NFL Scouting Combine on Saturday should improve his draft stock after a fantastic day. While his athletic ability was never in doubt, he broke long-standing records and his blazing speed caught the attention of observers.        The 21-year-old broke the record of the longest vertical jump for any quarterback since 2003 by scoring a 40.5\'\' jump. The 6\'4\'\' quarterback also ran an excellent 4.44 in the 40-yard dash, one of the fastest-ever for a passer. Anthony Richardson\'s athletic excellence drew comparisons to other former Florida quarterback, Cam Newton.            Both are two strong-armed quarterbacks with threatening rushing ability. How do the two players compare in their Combine performances?  Is Anthony Richardson more athletic than Cam Newton? Comparing the two quarterbacks Although the latest Florida quarterback broke the vertical jump record today, he\'s very similar to Cam in many athletic aspects NFL Research@NFLResearchAnthony Richardson just broke the record for the highest vertical jump (40.5"") by any QB at the combine since at least 2003 @FloridaGators #NFLCombine67597     When Newton performed in 2011, he all but cemented his status as the first overall pick for that year\'s draft. His only real competitor that year was Blaine Gabbert, who ended up in the 10th overall pick with the Jacksonville Jaguars - Jake Locker was taken with the eighth overall pick by the Tennessee Titans. Anthony Richardson\'s competition is higher this year, as Alabama\'s Bryce Young and Ohio State\'s CJ Stroud are set to be the first two quarterbacks taken. However, the excellent Combine performance alongside his great work ethic and some good interviews can improve his stock even further, perhaps landing him in the draft\'s top 5. Having a good athletic profile can cut you a lot of flack in the league, especially as it relates to things such as completing passes in short windows or escaping the pocket to get yards on the move. These are two things that Newton was excellent at, and the Florida star can become a great quarterback with the same playing style.     ', ""Which team would be the perfect fit for Cam Newton?  Cam Newton's stint with the New England Patriots came to a surprising end as the quarterback was released to reach the 53-man roster limit.  Newton was the Patriots' starting quarterback for the 2020 season and entered a battle with rookie Mac Jones for the job in the pre-season, which Jones definitely won today with the veteran's release. The 2015 NFL MVP made some good appearances in the pre-season, but New England decided to focus on the future and give Jones the most snaps he can take as a rookie.        It's also worth noting that even though Newton seems to be healthier than 2020, Jones gives the Patriots the best chance to win in 2021.           There wasn't just one reason that Cam Newton is gone. It was a combination of at least three, I'm told: Mac Jones' emergence, Newton's vaccination stance (which caused a bit of a stir behind the scenes) and Cam's uninspiring performance this summer.‚Äî Adam Beasley (@AdamHBeasley) August 31, 2021 However, a question arises with Newton's release: which team would be the best fit for the veteran in 2021? Washington Football Team the most logic spot for Newton With the regular season only nine days away, there aren't a lot of spots that make sense for Newton to be in. Washington is the outlier in that sense.     Connections with coach Ron Rivera, who drafted and coached Newton for the Carolina Panthers from 2011 to 2019, made it a possibility when the veteran first became a free agent in March 2020. A deal was never reached because Washington had Dwayne Haskins on the roster and they focused on developing the young quarterback, but things went south from there. The situation is different now, as Newton knows he'll have to settle for a backup role if he wants to play in 2021. Ryan Fitzpatrick, Washington's starter, has been kind of a journeyman during his career, and we can never discard the possibility of Fitzpatrick being benched. Super Bowl 50 - Carolina Panthers v Denver Broncos     If Newton joins Washington, he'll be on a team where the backup position is valuable and, if something happens to Fitzpatrick, whether he gets injured or is benched for a poor performance, Newton would play for a team that gives him an opportunity to compete for a playoff spot. A couple of factors in play with releasing Cam Newton rather than keeping him on as the Patriots' backup: His command of the locker room, and his vaccination status. Neither make him an ideal choice as a backup behind a rookie QB.‚Äî Doug Kyed (@DougKyed) August 31, 2021 Newton needs to settle for a backup role With the regular season only a few days away, Newton won't be the presumed starter for any team, even those with a murky quarterback situation.     This is not a position like offensive lineman or kickers, where it doesn't take much to learn the system and you can just go out and perform. Quarterbacks are the most important pieces on a team and it always takes some time to learn the playbook.That's why Washington is the best landing spot for Newton. He's already familiar with the coaching staff. He'll have a shot at playing during the season, considering who their starter is.But if the veteran thinks he'll be able to find a starting spot in the league, even after a decent pre-season, he's setting himself up for disappointment.     "", ""Is Cam Newton still playing football?  Cam Newton has had more than a decade-long career, mostly with the Carolina Panthers. After starting his NFL journey in 2011, he was the face of the Panthers until, in 2020, he switched teams and played a season for the New England Patriots.   The Panthers did not lose faith in their former QB and gave him a chance to start a few games last season.        Panthers fans cannot wait to see their favorite QB play this season.

Also, later in this article, fantasy football lovers will get to know whether Newton should be in their 2022 fantasy football draft.      Is Cam Newton still playing football? Newton in action Cam Newton, after playing his ninth season with the Panthers, was released after suffering a series of injuries that led to him missing most of the game for the Panthers in 2019.  In 2020, there was a spot open for the leading quarterback at the Patriots after seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady left for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.        In 2020, Newton signed a one-year deal with the Patriots and started all 15 games as their leading quarterback. However, his performance with the Patriots was one of the least efficient, where he threw for 2,657 yards and completed 242 of 368 passes with eight touchdowns and 10 interceptions. NFL@NFLPanthers agree to terms with Cam Newton.564386104 In 2021, Newton lost his starting QB seat in the Patriots to Mac Jones and was later released by them. After serving as a free agent for a few months, the Panthers took him in after their starting QB Sam Darnold sustained a shoulder injury mid-season.      Where is Cam Newton playing now? Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Carolina Panthers Newton started in five games but could not lead his side to a single victory. Although his level of performance is at its lowest, he still believes he can outplay any QB in the league. He is currently a free agent and is looking for the right team to sign him up. The Panthers are in trouble again this season. Their rookie quarterback Matt Corral has sustained a Lisfranc injury and Sam Darnold's ankle sprain might keep him away from some games. The Panthers are left with QB Baker Mayfield and PJ Walker. Will the Panthers once again sign a deal with Newton for this season?      Cam Newton's fantasy football update and predictions All the teams in the NFL have named their 53-man roster, and Newton is not on any of those lists. Chances are low that Newton will return to the league this year, so drafting him into your fantasy team does not sound like a good idea.    Even if he lands up against the Panthers this season, chances are low that he will start games for them. The Panthers have Baker Mayfield as their starting QB. It is best to look for other alternatives for the QB2 position.      Possible Cam Newton alternatives for your fantasy teamInstead of opting for Newton, there are many options available, with Justin Fields, Jameis Winston, Tua Tagovailoa, and Trevor Lawrence. In fantasy football, you never know who lands up in the top 10 at the end of the league, but these four options seem promising if you need a backup QB.     "", ""Should the Dolphins sign Cam Newton? ‚Äì NFL Rumors  The era of Tua Tagovailoa may be going on hiatus for the Miami Dolphins after Tagovailoa suffered a rib injury and was carted off the field. In his place, Jacoby Brissett stepped up and put together a rough performance, throwing for 169 yards and an interception en route to a Week Two loss. The performance sets a dark tone for the near future.  The Dolphins, a win-now organization in 2021, could be looking to the market for anyone who can give the team a boost to weather the injury. Luckily for them, Cam Newton is available just weeks after being cut in New England. Would Cam Newton be a good fit with the Dolphins?        Dolphins diving deep for Cam Newton?           The Patriots and the Dolphins are sworn enemies but the modern-day Dolphins are heavily influenced by the team. Their head coach, Brian Flores, was a position coach under Bill Belichick. The Dolphins' roster is also sprinkled with ex-Patriots, including Jacoby Brissett, Eric Rowe and Jason McCourty. If the Patriots have already permeated the team, why not sign another ex-Patriot?

Of course, the Dolphins defeated the Patriots in Week 1, but the win was largely a result of Mac Jones' first start. He may be much different by the next time the two teams play. Anything the Dolphins can do to stay ahead of the Patriots should be done.     As an added bonus, by signing Cam Newton, the Dolphins would be keeping the Patriots from re-signing the quarterback if they change their minds. If something were to happen to Mac Jones, the Patriots would have no choice but to lean on Brian Hoyer. This would keep the Patriots down while keeping the Dolphins up.     The Dolphins are serious about the playoffs this season, so it makes sense to sign a quarterback who has plenty of playoff experience. It may have been a while for Cam Newton, but he has already shown he can perform in the playoffs. He knows how to deal with the pressure of the moment and can provide advice to Tagovailoa if he makes the playoffs.     Cam Newton after Super Bowl 50 between Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos Lastly, if the Dolphins somehow make the Super Bowl with Newton, they would have a quarterback who could deal with that pressure.

He was cut at the last moment for Mac Jones and spent most of the year on the couch. It took until November for a team to dial his phone number. In an odd twist of fate, it was his old team, the Carolina Panthers (currently 5-10, 4th in the NFC South). It must have felt like the twilight zone, as much of the coaching staff was entirely new. The roster was much different this time around. That said, there was hope that he could give the Panthers a jolt back to life. Instead, the Panthers are on roughly the same trajectory as they were before Newton arrived. This season, he has put together roughly the same performance in Carolina that he put together in New England. With the Patriots, he threw eight touchdowns and ten interceptions. With the Panthers in 2021, he\'s thrown for four touchdowns and five interceptions. In other words, he has turned the ball over just a bit more often than the number of touchdowns he\'s thrown.     Will he retire at the end of 2021? The extra time on the couch has given the quarterback time to develop some other interests and feel out what life would be like without playing on Sundays. In 2021, he got a side-by-side comparison of what life would be like on the couch and on the field.     Considering how long it took for him to get a call, he may not have a choice. If the Panthers decide to go in a new direction next season, he could be stuck at home. This could have been his last chance. That said, he does have an opportunity to serve as a ""Taysom Hill"" gadget quarterback, if a team wants him for that purpose.However, there are only a handful of destinations that would be interested in something like that. Of those choices, most would likely be more willing to get a younger player who isn\'t as injury-prone as Newton has been in the past. Either way, for Newton, it seems his days in the NFL are numbered.     ']"
38,Jay Cutler,"[""Bodybuilding legend Jay Cutler leg workout  As we know, leg muscles are our biggest muscles. They provide us with a foundation as they support athletic performance. But people usually ignore lower body workouts and focus on the upper body muscles. However, this wasn't the case with bodybuilder Jay Cutler. He always focused on every muscle in his body and achieved great success in the industry as a result. His workout inspired many people. He even defeated eight-time Mr. Olympia winner Ronnie Coleman in 2006.            Cutler continued to work hard and put in all his efforts to stay in shape and healthy. He is also known for having four Mr. Olympia title wins to his name. Cutler retained his name at the top three more times (2007, 2009, and 2010).      High-volume leg workout of Jay Cutler 1.) Reverse Hack Squats This exercise is vital for a strong foundation as it strengthens thigh muscles. However, it also improves hip and ankle agility, which has other benefits that help with other lower body lifts like heavy deadlifts.         2.) Leg Extension This exercise is all about quadricep resistance weight training. It's performed using a machine known as the Leg Extension Machine. It also contributes to reinforcing the lower body.         3.) Belt Squat Belt squats are the simplest way to employ movement. Bodybuilders use a normal dip-belt with a load slung between their thighs. The issue comes with clearance, so it has been seen that individuals practice these by standing on two boxes or using benches so that the weight can dip below their foot level and they can get better results from it.     4.) Standing Leg Curl This exercise is also known as the Hamstring Curl, and it is performed to isolate the hamstrings. It involves bending the posture of the knees and moving the heels towards the butt while the rest of the body stays static. The quads are pressed in the opposite direction of the pad, notably decreasing the possibility of other muscles compensating for it.         5.) Seated Leg Curl This exercise is also known as a seated hamstring curl, and is performed with a weight machine to work the muscles in the back of the thigh. The muscle can be more effectively strengthened by being seated rather than being positioned inclined.         Conclusion Jay Cutler is one of the most prominent bodybuilders that has passed really well into the aura of social media. He is an influential personality and one of the best voices in the sport of bodybuilding. He also runs a successful podcast, the Cutler Cast, where he interacts with people in the bodybuilding industry and gives bodybuilding advice. His workout videos and interactive sessions are a vital source of energy for those looking to become a great bodybuilder.

One such athlete is Dexter jackson, who won the 2008 Olympia.  Despite only winning one Sandow trophy, Jackson has gained the status of legend in the game. This is mainly due to his position as the athlete with the most professional men\'s bodybuilding titles. In his heyday, Jackson competed against some prolific bodybuilders such as Ronnie Coleman and Jay Cutler.        In a recent video uploaded to his YouTube channel, Dexter revealed that he learned a thing or two from his former rival Jay Cutler.

Jay Cutler is often termed one of the top most professional bodybuilders in the history of bodybuilding. Jay was born in Sterling, Massachusetts on August 3, 1973. He has competed in 13 editions of Mr. Olympia, one of the most prestigious events in bodybuilding.  Jay Cutler has won the Mr. Olympia title four times in his career. He was crowned Mr. Olympia in 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010. His first participation in Mr. Olympia was in 1999, where he secured a 14th-place finish with 204 points.        Cutler achieved his first-ever Mr. Olympia title victory in 2006. His never-back-down performance despite finishing in second place for several years was fruitful as he finally defeated longtime rival Ronnie Coleman. Jay scored a total of 22 points. The prize money earned by Cutler for winning the 2006 Mr. Olympia was $155,000.  Jay's second Mr. Olympia title win came the following year in 2007. He won the competition by scoring 28 points and earned $155,000. Victor Martinez of the Dominican Republic finished in second place behind Cutler. The Massachusetts-born bodybuilder faced a stumbling block in his streak as he finished second in the 2008 Mr. Olympia competition. Dexter Jackson won that year. Once again, Jay made a comeback in 2009 by winning Mr. Olympia that year.      His victory in the 2009 Mr. Olympia in a non-consecutive year was appreciated very much as the other two bodybuilders to achieve that feat were Arnold Schwarzenegger and Franco Columbu. This time the prize money won by Jay was $200,000. Cutler won his fourth and final Mr. Olympia title in 2010. Along with the title, he won $200,000. Jay competed in two more editions of Mr. Olympia in 2011 and 2013. In the 2011 edition of Mr. Olympia, Jay finished as a runner-up and earned $100,000. Cutler's last-ever Mr. Olympia competition was in 2013, where he finished in sixth place and won $30,000.  Jay Cutler's early career days From the age of 11, Jay Cutler worked in his family's concrete construction business called the Cutler Bros Concrete, according to Fitness Volt. When Jay was 18 years old, he started training during his time at Wachusett Regional High School. Cutler graduated from Quinsigamond Community College in 1993 with a degree in criminal justice because he planned on working as a Corrections Officer for a maximum security prison. Jay was inspired to step into bodybuilding after meeting Marcos Rodriguez.     Jay Cutler (Image via Generation Iron) He won his very first title the same year he graduated from college. Cutler's first win came in the 1993 Iron Bodies Invitational, but his first-ever contest was the 1992 Gold's Gym Worcester Bodybuilding Championships, according to Fitness Volt. He finished as the runner-up in that competition. Cutler's second title in 1993 was the NPC (National Physique Committee) Teen Nationals (Middleweight). At the age of 22, he won the 1995 NPC U.S. Tournament of Champions. He was the overall champion in that competition. In 2000, Jay Cutler won the IFFB Night of Champions.        Between 1995 and 2000, Jay Cutler competed in the 1996 NPC Nationals, 1998 IFBB Night of Champions, 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger Classic, 1999 IFBB Ironman Pro Invitational, and 1999 Mr. Olympia. From 2000 onwards, Culter entered his prime and would eventually go on to win several titles, including four Mr. Olympia titles.

Jay Cutler is one of the most accomplished bodybuilders in recent memory. Since his retirement in 2013, however, he hasn't lifted in any capacity in the last nine years. Many of his fans must therefore be wondering what he's up to now.  Given the solo nature of bodybuilding, it's tougher to remain involved with the sport beyond retirement than it is for other sports. Players of basketball, football, baseball, and the like can enter coaching or broadcasting‚Äîtwo things that are less common in bodybuilding.        Cutler has not competed in a while and has turned his focus to his company, Cutler Nutrition, which is a bodybuilding supplement business. However, he also has promotions and other business ventures on social media. Arguably, he's been just as successful since he retired, if not more.    Additionally, he and a partner, Pat LaFreida, teamed up to make one of Cutler's dreams come true. They own CUTS: Monthly Subscription Boxes of Fresh Protein, a company that puts meat right on subscribers' doorsteps.     Since stepping down from professional competition, the bodybuilder has become a bit of a capitalist, working mainly on the business side of things. Despite not competing, however, Jay Cutler has not stopped working out. Even at the age of 48, he spends a lot of time in the gym. It's been many years since he competed, but he still looks like he could go out there and give it another shot. At some point, bodybuilders are no longer able to participate in the activity they loved so much in their prime, but Cutler has not given up his favorite pastime just yet. It seems that, for as long as he is able, the former star bodybuilder will continue to work on his business ventures and his body.  Jay Cutler's prime: How good was the bodybuilder? Cutler is a four-time Mr. Olympia. He won in 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010. He finished second in 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2011. In his final Mr. Olympia competition, he finished sixth.     His 2001 placement was revoked when he was banned on account of illegal diuretic substances, but he sued to have the placement reinstated. The bodybuilder in 2022 (Image via Men's Health) He is just the third-ever Mr. Olympia to win in non-consecutive years. Many bodybuilders who lose aren't able to regain their form so easily and win another one later. He also won consecutive Arnold Classics in 2002, 2003, and 2004. He placed second to Ronnie Coleman in the Mr. Olympia competition four times before he was able to break through and win one.        Here are his incredible stats from his competing days, per Wikipedia: Height: 5 ft 9 in (175 cm)Off-season weight: 290‚Äì310 pounds (132‚Äì141 kg)Competition weight: 260‚Äì274 pounds (118‚Äì124 kg)Upper arms: 22 in (56 cm)Chest: 58 in (150 cm)Thighs: 30 in (76 cm)Waist: 29 in (74 cm)Calves: 20 in (51 cm)Thanks to his amazing performance during his competitive years and shrewd business acumen following his retirement, he is one of the richest bodybuilders in the world. He presently has a net worth of about $30 million.

He is one of the best Mr. Olympia performers, with seven consecutive titles from 2011-2017. In his time, Heath displayed some of the best poses in the game.  The latest episode of the Cutler Cast featured the seven-time Mr. Olympia. In conversation with four-time Mr. Olympia champion Jay Cutler, Heath revealed that he has never abused performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) during his reign in the sport and was always conservative about the use of drugs.            Heath on his PED use Heath competed with several massive names, including Dexter Jackson, Coleman, and Jay Cutler. He won multiple Sandow trophies in a row, tying the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger at seven. Heath, during the podcast, mentioned that his conservative use of PEDs came after his competing and winning naturally. ""I‚Äôm just going to say it here: I was never pushing PEDs like right away. I was competing naturally and beating guys that weren‚Äôt.""     Viewing a picture of him and Cutler together, Heath mentioned that people would repetitively nag him about his PED-use cycle. ""When I met you ‚Äì that picture ‚Äì when I show people that picture, they‚Äôre like, ‚Äòwhat kind of stuff were you on.‚Äô Like do you really want to know what ... I was eating. That‚Äôs the difference. I have those genetics.""         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Heath pointed out that his passion for basketball most likely helped him gain some serious mass in his legs.     ""I do think playing Division I basketball and running all the time and doing all that work ... the stimulation of being a defensive ... like I was always in the defense. Imagine being in a squat like a defensive stance non-stop."" Heath then drew a parallel between his defensive skills in basketball and his bodybuilding journey: ""We do that for a bodybuilding show being in that same stance doing lunges and all that."" Mr Olympia Phil Heath poses during a media call ahead of the 2012 IFBB Australian Pro Grand Prix XIII (Photo by Robert Cianflone/Getty Images)     During his reign as Mr. Olympia, Heath was known for his fragile skin, giving his muscles a unique definition and an edge over the other athletes. ""I think bodybuilding was the perfect sport but my skin texture is what people don‚Äôt realize ‚Äî that‚Äôs what really set me apart from everybody and the person who said that was the late Peter McGough"" For the untrained eye, McGough was a legendary journalist in the sport. He provided bodybuilders with incredible insight and was a close friend of Heath\'s.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Heath criticized the turn the sport has taken today about PED use. He said athletes sacrifice muscular definitions to build bigger physiques through drugs which are quite detrimental to skin texture. ""The guys today don‚Äôt have that probably because of shot injections, probably because of their training, but as far as the poundage ... I never got intimidated by watching someone like yourself or Ronnie [Coleman] thinking that that‚Äôs what I have to do to be champion.""Nicknamed \'The Gift,\' Heath is a giant in the sport. He last competed in 2020, but in November last year, Heath promised a comeback in 2023. We cannot wait to see what the year holds for him.

After carving out a successful career as a professional in the sport, he has taken up the role of a mentor in recent years by using his various platforms to help younger athletes in the game.  The 2023 Arnold Classic concluded with a bang as Samson Dauda took the title home. However, it has raised a few questions regarding the judging on the show, with many believing that Nick \'The Mutant\' Walker deserved the first place. In a recent episode of Jaywalking, Cutler had some words of advice for the young bodybuilder.        ""If I could say anything, I did mention this to Nick, is you got to work with your strengths. His strengths is definitely outmuscling people. Unfortunately, he‚Äôs not going to overly shape a Samson or a Derek Lunsford.""         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Nick Walker definitely brought the most well-conditioned package to the Arnold Classic. This fact was even admitted to by the champion Samson Dauda and his coach. However, his symmetry and proportions were a little off.     Cutler added that the top three positions could\'ve gone either way: ""The top three could‚Äôve gone anyway in my opinion ... I had predicted Nick, and I thought nick could‚Äôve won it. He could have but Samson looked incredible. Andrew made a huge impact, huge improvements. From the judges‚Äô talk, Nick didn‚Äôt appear as full and round as maybe the Olympia, which he says he was better. I talked to him yesterday."" Although Cutler believes Walker could have gone home with the title, he takes nothing away from crowned champion Samson Dauda: ""I feel Nick is constantly improving. His shape has improved tremendously. He was the frontrunner going in. It didn‚Äôt go his way. He missed out on a huge payday to an unbelievable Samson. That was huge for him. He‚Äôs massive. Milos said he weighed around 290. Obviously, he‚Äôs a little taller.""         Jay Cutler believes there is an incoming ""threat"" of ""taller guys"" with the introduction of Samson Dauda and Andrew Jacked The Open division of bodybuilding has historically seen athletes with average heights win more titles. This is primarily due to the issue of proportionality with taller athletes. However, Cutler believes there may be a surge of success for taller athletes in the near future, especially seeing the success Dauda and Jacked saw at the Arnold Classic.     ""But is this the threat of the taller guys coming in now with him and Andrew Jacked who really people question he could‚Äôve won or came in second or third.""         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post Cutler praised Andrew Jacked for his performance at the Classic against some of the best bodybuilders in the world. ""Andrew didn‚Äôt have the overwhelming wow factor that he had in the earlier shows and I think because he was in such great condition standing next to those guys. It‚Äôs a different lineup. You can say so-and-so placed at the Olympia so I got past them and now I‚Äôm in this position. That‚Äôs not true though. It‚Äôs show to show. That can change dramatically.""With Mr. Olympia approaching, the top three finishers at the Arnold Classic will be looking to make significant improvements to try and dethrone Hadi Choopan.

The Egyptian bodybuilder finished fifth while Iran‚Äôs Hadi Choopan clinched the trophy. Following this, several veterans and experts came forward to analyze why the former two-time champion lost.  Bodybuilding icon Jay Cutler became the latest to address the surprising result of the 2022 Mr. Olympia. The four-time Olympia winner was recapping the event with Serbian bodybuilder Milos Sarcev when he discussed Ramy‚Äôs fall. Pondering over how the bodybuilder finished fifth, Cutler said that everyone was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù in their predictions.        Cutler stated that Big Ramy could push back next year, even though the Egyptian did not produce the expected performance this time. Speaking about the 2022 Mr. Olympia result with Milos Sarcev on the Cutler Cast YouTube channel, Jay said: ‚ÄúI still think Ramy can push back [next year], if he gets back to being full and hard.‚Äù Addressing the predictions he made ahead of the competition, Cutler said that Ramy did nothing to retain his title. He added: ‚ÄúWe were all wrong about Ramy. Ramy did not produce like we expected.

""We talked about Derek Lunsford ‚Äî could he be second, maybe not win it because we had this thing about Mr. Olympias never winning it on the first time once, except for the first time in 1965.

He pointed out that the Egyptian won the competition in 2020 and 2021 with the same problems that also arose this time. Discussing Ramy‚Äôs fall, Sarcev said: ‚ÄúYou [Cutler] said you were concerned about his back to the sense that [you thought] he might not even win. In a sense, you were right. But he won with the same problems last year, so you would assume they are not going to penalize him now if they didn‚Äôt last year and if he‚Äôs a little bigger and just as conditioned or better ‚Äî then he would be the rightful winner.‚Äù     Following this, Jay Cutler stated that Big Ramy‚Äôs lats were his biggest problem on stage. He said: ‚ÄúThe lats obviously, but I thought the biggest issue with Ramy was number one, his condition, but more importantly, he couldn‚Äôt open up his back. What was going on with his back?‚Äù Sarcev replied: ‚ÄúNow they [judges] are going to look, they‚Äôre going to scan his triceps,‚Äù Milos Sarcev said. ‚ÄúI would say [his back had] issues.‚Äù   With the above comments, Jay Cutler joined a list of bodybuilders who said they felt let down by Big Ramy‚Äôs form at Mr. Olympia. Recently, Ramy‚Äôs close friend/training partner Dennis James revealed that the defending champion looked ‚Äúflat‚Äù hours before the competition.

Samir Bannout, a former Olympia winner, had a similar opinion on the weak field for the 2023 Arnold Classic. Bannout even made a joke about entering the competition himself due to the lack of competitors. Hunter Labrada and Derek Lunsford were his two suggestions for guests.     Although Arnold Schwarzenegger raised the prize money for the winner of the Men\'s Open category to a record $300,000, not many elite bodybuilders have registered.

However, it appears that a lot has changed. The tentative lineup for each division for the upcoming contest was released by the organizers last week. Brandon Curry, who won the 2022 Arnold Classic, does not appear to be participating in the upcoming competition, allowing for the emergence of a new winner. Shaun Clarida, a two-time 212 Olympia champion, and Kamal Elgargni, a former 212 Olympia champion, have joined the Open division roster. William Bonac and Samson Dauda will also be present. Shaun Clarida intimated that he would have to out-pose Samson on the Arnold stage while talking about the Dauda clash, adding that he\'s looking forward to the call-out.

Big Ramy is a two-time Mr. Olympia who lost his crown to Iranian Hadi Choopan a few months before the Classic at the 2022 Olympia. Big Ramy had significant issues on stage at the Olympia, perhaps suffering from a few injuries and some atrophy considering his age.

Mike White\'s stranglehold on the football-loving public\'s imagination is over, as the New York Jets announced that they would start Joe Flacco for their Sunday contest against the Miami Dolphins (1 p.m. ET, CBS). White put in a literal Hall of Fame performance on Oct. 31 against the Cincinnati Bengals, becoming the first NFL quarterback to throw for 400 yards and three touchdowns in his first career start.

However, reality intervened in the form of the Buffalo Bills, who victimized White for four interceptions in a 45-17 loss. Flacco led the Jets to their final score in the fourth quarter and returned to New York after spending the most recent preseason in Philadelphia.

Many would probably expect legends like Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, George Blanda, and Y.A. Tittle to appear on the list. Others, like Nick Foles and Joe Kapp, were able to carve professional football legacies beyond their high-scoring affairs but the addition of Adrian Burk is one that will certainly raise eyebrows among non-football historians.     Burk was the second overall pick of the 1950 NFL Draft but spent a relatively uneventful seven seasons with the Colts and Eagles. But an October 1954 afternoon with the latter helped him make history, as he threw seven touchdowns on only 27 attempts in a 49-21 win over Washington, becoming the first to earn that historic tally. That triumph was one of only 15 victories Burk would earn as a starter in his NFL career. Despite his history in a helmet, Burk is perhaps better known for his officiating endeavors as a back judge. Ironically, he was present when Kapp pulled off the feat in 1969. Burk was also part of the officiating crew for Franco Harris\' Immaculate Reception during the 1972-73 playoffs.

A 41-34 win for the Cleveland Browns over the Kansas City Chiefs featured over 900 yards of offense, 286 of which came from Browns running back Jerome Harrison. Harrison\'s tally was good for the third-best single-game rushing tally in NFL history. To put that in perspective, Harrison tallied only 301 total over the first 13 games of the 2008 season. That was enough for Cleveland to bring him back on a new contract and grant him the top rushing duties for the following season. Alas, Harrison was traded to Philadelphia in October of the following year. He was nearly sent back to the Eagles after signing with Detroit over the offseason, but he failed his physical after Philadelphia doctors discovered a brain tumor. Some expected Harrison to be a quadraplegic after the ordeal, but he has since regained most of his motor skills through a rigorous recovery process.     Flynn (10) threw for 480 yards in a 45-41 win (Photo: Getty) 1/1/12: Flynn the Money The NFL history of the Green Bay Packers has been written by aerial legends: Bart Starr, Brett Favre, Aaron Rodgers, and...Matt Flynn??? Titletown\'s single-game record for passing yards and touchdowns is held by Flynn, a seventh-round pick of the Packers in the 2008 draft. Flynn had made a single start entering Week 17 of the 2011-12 NFL season, when he was called upon to relieve a resting Rodgers before the top-seeded Packers began their playoff trek. Despite the relative lack of stakes, Flynn wowed audiences with a 480-yard, six-touchdown showing as the Packers earned a 45-41 victory over the Detroit Lions.     Flynn\'s output was enough to convince the Seattle Seahawks to shell out the big bucks: a three-year, $20.5 million contract awaited in the ensuing offseason, along with the implication that Flynn was the team\'s new franchise man. Alas for Flynn, the drafting of a third-round pick named Russell Wilson changed everything. He lasted only two more seasons in the NFL after that, a stretch that included a return to Green Bay in 2013-14. Gray scores one of his four touchdowns in the win over the Colts (Photo: Getty) 11/16/14: Gray Matter It has become a tiring NFL cliche/meme to say that Bill Belichick can win with anyone. But that axiom rang dangerously true during a November 2014 prime-time contest between Belichick\'s New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts.     With regular rushers Stevan Ridley and LeGarrette Blount unavailable, the Patriots bestowed their duties on Gray. That Sunday night\'s showdown against the Colts was the one-month anniversary of his promotion to the Patriots\' active roster. He went on to torch the Colts for 201 rushing yards and four scores, becoming the first player in the NFL\'s modern era to earn a touchdown quartet after entering the game with none. New England would win the game 42-20 and Gray earned cover duties for the ensuing week\'s issue of Sports Illustrated. Alas, Belichick giveth and Belichick taketh away: Gray took the costliest nap of his life during the ensuing week of practice, as his oversleeping made him late for practice after his phone died. Gray was originally suspended for a ""violation of team rules"" after the incident, but wound up being a healthy scratch in all but four of the Patriots\' remaining games that season. He was released by the Patriots at the end of training camp in 2015 and failed to catch on in Miami or Jacksonville.

The Jets QB has recently been under a lot of pressure from his teammates for not performing well enough to win them games, despite stellar performances by the team's defense.  That being said, the Jets have now decided to bench their 2021 second-overall pick for the foreseeable future in favor of backup QB Mike White. The 27-year-old quarterback lit up the league with his recent performance and is now looking to make the Jets' QB1 role his own.

Whether or not White can sustain his magic against the NFC franchise remains to be seen. But if he manages to lodge another three-touchdown performance in Week 13, things will surely get more difficult for Zach Wilson going forward.

On the heels of a heroic performance against one of the best teams in the AFC, the New York Jets and many fans are hoping to get a second look at backup quarterback Mike White. Was the win against the Cincinnati Bengals a fluke or have the Jets finally found something in him?   For the Jets to know for sure, they\'ll need to look at him a second time.        However, the flip side is that rookie quarterback Zach Wilson was the original plan before his knee injury sidelined him for the Bengals game. If the Jets decide to take an extended look at Mike White, it could mean the end for Wilson.            That said, if Wilson is still unable to play due to injury, the Jets could be in a perfect spot to keep Wilson\'s future on the docket while also getting another look at White. Will Zach Wilson\'s injury keep him out of tonight\'s game? Will Mike White play tonight in relief of Zach Wilson? Zach Wilson is working through a PCL injury in his knee, according to CBS Sports. Usually, severe knee injuries can knock players out for the season.  However, this is not that type of injury and Wilson won\'t miss the rest of 2021. That said, he won\'t be able to play tonight against the Colts and is out.      Wilson is expected to return in Week 10 against the Buffalo Bills. Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterIt‚Äôs another Mike White Day.3:29 AM ¬∑ Nov 4, 2021221381158 It is no surprise that Wilson will not be playing in tonight\'s game against the Indianapolis Colts. He was unable to play on Sunday, and four days is rarely enough time to recover from any game-ending injury.  However, with the Jets facing a somewhat lengthy nine-day ""mini-bye"" after the game, Wilson should be able to make a recovery and return to the field in Week 10 barring any setbacks.     Joe Caporoso@JCaporosoThursday is Mike White night, America‚Ä¶4:51 AM ¬∑ Nov 4, 202171369 Mike White is currently playing better than Wilson has this season with his first start upsetting the now 5-3 Cincinnati Bengals. Against the Bengals, White threw for 405 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions.         If he can have a similar performance tonight, he could give the Jets a big question heading into the mini-bye. Will the Jets return to Wilson when healthy or ride with White? Zach Wilson at New York Jets v Atlanta Falcons The Jets may be quietly hoping they lose the game so they don\'t have to make that decision. If they do lose, White will likely return to the bench and Wilson will return as the starter. However, if White repeats Sunday\'s performance, the Jets will have a tough decision on their hands. For the Jets, tonight\'s game could suddenly change the trajectory of the franchise and certainly that of Mike White.     ', 'Who is the Jets‚Äô starting QB this week vs Lions? Mike White injury forces Robert Saleh to make tough call  The New York Jets will make another change at quarterback this week, as starting quarterback Mike White was ruled out on Friday, December 8th. Doctors won\'t clear him for contact before Sunday\'s contest, resulting in him being inactive.  The bad news for White spells good news for another quarterback. The injury paves the way for Zach Wilson to start and get another opportunity at quarterback.        Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterSources: Jets doctors will not clear QB Mike White for contact before Sunday‚Äôs game vs. Detroit and thus Zach Wilson will start against the Lions.

The Jets listed him as day-to-day, but after more testing this week, his injury showed more damage than expected, which has forced him out this week. White wants to play through the injury, but doctors refuse to clear him. Brian Costello@BrianCozTo clear one thing up, Mike White was cleared to return to the game Sunday in Buffalo after he had X-Rays in the stadium. He had further, more precise testing this week that showed further injury and that led to him not being cleared for contact this week.419 Wilson will make his eighth start of the season this Sunday vs. the roaring Detroit Lions. He was benched following the Jets\' 10‚Äì3 loss to the Patriots in Week 11 where he completed nine of 22 passes.     Following the loss to the Patriots, Wilson made something of a mess of an interview. When asked if he thought his performance had a part in the outcome of the game, and if he felt he had let down the defense, he simply answered: ""No."" The Jets defense had let in only three points all game, with the game-losing touchdown coming from a punt return with only seconds remaining. The refusal to be held accountable was part of the reason why the team benched him. How long will Mike White be out? Mike White - New York Jets v Buffalo Bills     There are multiple factors to consider when answering this question. While the New York Jets expected to have Mike White for this Sunday\'s contest vs. the Lions, they\'ll have to wait until at least next week for him to return. According to Brian Costello, who covers the Jets for the New York Post, White may not be ready to go for next week\'s game vs. the Jacksonville Jaguars. Brian Costello@BrianCozSaleh said White will be evaluated Monday but they have a short week next week so his availability against the Jaguars on Thursday is a question.457 Head coach Robert Saleh said White will be evaluated Monday, but the Jets have a short week as they face the Jags in Thursday Night Football. There\'s also no guarantee White will start again. Wilson could have a terrific game on Sunday, and has the chance to win the spot back. The pressure is definitely on for Zach Wilson, as fans have largely turned their back on him and see Mike White as their future QB. All eyes will be on Wilson in Week 15 and he needs to win not just the game, but also the Jets fanbase.

These two teams are coming from unexpected endings to their respective games in Week 8. The Jets, who are missing Zach Wilson, saw Mike White with a Lou Gehrig-like performance, throwing for more than 400 yards and leading his team to a 34-31 upset win against the Cincinnati Bengals.

Now, they must hope to grab a wild card spot, because the division is out of reach.

How did Carson Wentz manage to lose the game so hard? As the Jets and the Colts go into Thursday's matchup, they have to be wondering what happened last week. It's not even about the results themselves, but if you say you were expecting Mike White to throw for over 400 yards in his first career start, there's no way to trust you, honestly. There's a fun aspect to watch this game even though the chances of these teams playing in the postseason are slim. You might wonder if Mike White will repeat his awesome NFL debut, or stay ready for another Carson Wentz miraculous interception.

This was another devastating loss for the Jets, whose playoff ambitions have fallen apart.  Wilson once again played poorly and was benched by the Jets in the second half of the game. Chris Streveler came in to replace him, but the Jets weren\'t able to change the outcome of the result.                     In light of another terrible performance from Wilson, many trolled the New York Jets quarterback. NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe also chimed in to take a subtle dig at Wilson. Here\'s what Sharpe tweeted about Zach Wilson after his awful performance against the Jacksonville Jaguars: ""Zach Wilson says cougar hunting is easier than playing qb in the NFL.

Unfortunately, the former BYU quarterback hasn\'t been able to showcase his skills on the field this season. It is highly probable that the loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars was his last-ever start for the Jets, as the franchise will look to use the other quarterbacks on their roster. Due to their four-game losing streak, New York will head into their next game against the Seattle Seahawks as the underdogs.       Is the Zach Wilson era over in New York? Zach Wilson: Detroit Lions v New York Jets As stated earlier, the game against the Jaguars might have been the last start for Wilson in New York. The team clearly plays better with other quarterbacks than with Wilson. As a result, the Jets will look to play with Joe Flacco or Chris Streveler if Mike White isn\'t healthy. nick wright@getnickwrightIt‚Äôs absolutely amazing that the *moment* literally ANY quarterback other than Zach Wilson plays for the Jets their offense markedly improves.4502289     Jets head coach Robert Saleh has stated that this isn\'t the end of Wilson in New York, but it\'s really hard to see him continuing. Against the Jaguars, Wilson finished the game by completing 9/18 throws for 92 yards and an interception. He had a passer rating of 41.9. Ari Meirov@MySportsUpdate#Jets HC Robert Saleh said they didn\'t intend to bench Zach Wilson tonight. The goal was to get the run game going by bringing in Chris Streveler -- and they eventually opted to stick with him once they realized the offense got a spark.

40,Jimmy Garoppolo,"[""Has Jimmy Garoppolo secured his place as the 49ers starting QB after Week 3 performance?  Jimmy Garoppolo has been under plenty of scrutiny throughout his career. Many wonder if he is, in fact, the long-term answer for the San Francisco 49ers.  Those thoughts were exaggerated even more when the 49ers drafted Trey Lance in the 2020 NFL Draft. Lance went on to turn heads throughout the preseason and is often being showcased as a much better prospect than other rookie quarterbacks.        After the 49ers played an intense game, losing to the Green Bay Packers in the final seconds of Sunday night's game, the question remains: is Jimmy Garoppolo the answer at quarterback?           Is Trey Lance a better option than Jimmy Garoppolo? Jimmy Garoppolo hasn't exactly played badly in the first three weeks of NFL action, but the idea now is should he remain the starter? The 49ers could very well go the route that the Miami Dolphins took in 2020 when Ryan Fitzpatrick was benched in favor of rookie Tua Tagovailoa. Tua went on to have a 6-3 record last season under center. Trey Lance may have more upside than Tua. The only way to truly find out would be to bench Garoppolo. The standing rumors are that the 49ers may make that change somewhere in Week 6 or 7 of this season. The 49ers are currently 2-1 and in third place in the NFC West. Should they lose another game, they may be trailing far behind the undefeated Arizona Cardinals and Los Angeles Rams.     NFL on CBS üèà@NFLonCBSHighest on-target throw % in NFL:1. Mac Jones 90.9%2. Baker Mayfield 89.6%3. Jimmy Garoppolo 88.5%*min 45 attempts6:13 AM ¬∑ Sep 22, 20211504181 Jimmy Garoppolo's stats are decent enough to lend to the idea that he should remain the starter. Garoppolo currently has 257 yards with 2 TDs and 1 INT. His 64 attempts on 95 attempts give a 67.4% completion percentage. He also has a 101.2 passer rating with these numbers. Garoppolo's numbers in completion percentage, total yards, and passer rating have him hovering around the middle mark for all active quarterbacks. That could be the reasoning behind the rumors surrounding Trey Lance starting at some point this season.     The issue with Garoppolo is his need or want to throw the ball downfield more than he currently has. Garoppolo's longest pass is for 79 yards, which is quite good. However, his 8 yards per attempt is his total average. It's a stat that most quarterbacks will want to improve upon. Garoppolo needs to have more confidence in throwing the long ball, or he might not be able to. His mobility could still be in question after a lackluster 2020 campaign due to lingering injuries.

Lance might be the spark that could reignite the game of the 49ers.Right now, Garoppolo should stay put as the starter, but that doesn't necessarily mean that Lance should not get his shot at some point this season.Also Check Out: How many NFL Bye weeks in 2021?     "", '‚ÄúJimmy Garoppolo is a top tier scammer‚Äù ‚Äì NFL fans tear into 49ers QB as Broncos limp to 11-10 win on Sunday Night Football  A wild day in the NFL came to a tame finish, as the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers served up a slow, sluggish, low-scoring affair on Sunday Night Football.  Both offenses struggled to move the ball as the game boiled down to a punting contest, much to the dismay of the Denver faithful, who even booed their team. But late in the fourth quarter, Russell Wilson conjured a touchdown drive, and the Broncos defense forced two turnovers to help the home side beat the 49ers 11-10.        Both Wilson and his opposing quarterback, Jimmy Garoppolo, were heavily criticized on social media for their lackluster performances. The 49ers star, in particular, was incessantly lambasted by fans.            Garoppolo is notably starting games for San Francisco only because Trey Lance suffered a season-ending injury in Week 2. He completed 18 of his 29 pass attempts for 211 yards, one touchdown, and one costly interception against the Broncos. But the most perplexing moment in Garoppolo\'s underwhelming performance was the two points he gave up after stepping out of bounds while in the end zone.

Los Angeles and Patrick Mahomes\' Kansas City side are both 2-1 this season. Their other two games against the Carolina Panthers and Atlanta Falcons may look easy on paper. But given their struggles on offense, it could prove to be an arduous month for San Francisco, who are 1-2 so far this season.Head coach Kyle Shanahan has plenty to ponder upon before his team\'s Monday Night Football clash against the Rams next week. Armed with a quarterback he was desperate to discard in Garoppolo, Shanahan has to find a way to make things work before the season spirals into doom.

He holds the record for the three fewest passing yards thrown in a playoff game in franchise history, including his game versus the Packers.     In the playoffs in the 2019 season, he threw for 77 yards in the NFC Championship game against Green Bay and 131 yards in the Divisional round versus the Minnesota Vikings.Garoppolo and the 49ers face the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship game for a chance to go to the Super Bowl. For Kimes, the numbers don‚Äôt lie for Jimmy G in the postseason.     "", 'Jimmy Garoppolo could make these 3 teams contenders  Considering Jimmy Garoppolo‚Äôs stellar resume, his availability on the open market is likely to be short lived. While Garoppolo has done his best to win the San Francisco 49ers the Super Bowl, he came up short against the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2019 season. Just this past season, Garoppolo was only one offensive drive away from leading the 49ers back to the Super Bowl. Unfortunately for them, they lost to the Los Angeles Rams.  With the franchise moving forward with sophomore quarterback Trey Lance, Jimmy Garoppolo has become expendable. Several teams have expressed an interest in the quarterback, and at some point, a franchise will come for him. By and large, his game isn‚Äôt flashy or highlight reel worthy. But that said, Jimmy Garoppoo wins games and there are many teams who could use this trait.        His next destination is currently unknown, but here are three teams that could turn themselves into Super Bowl contenders with his help.           #1- Miami Dolphins   The Miami Dolphins continue to exhibit patience when it comes to Tua Tagovailoa. Through two fairly disappointing seasons, Tagovailoa‚Äôs shine has dimmed considerably. Yet, as the franchise pondered long and hard over his future, they decided against getting rid of him. Instead, Miami doubled down, getting their hands on dynamic wide receiver Tyreek Hill. Still, even with Hill creating space for his quarterback, Tagovailoa might fail in 2023.        In back-to-back seasons, Tagovailoa has been castigated for his unwillingness to launch the ball down the field. This is despite having ample opportunities to do so. Tagovailoa, thus far, has failed to throw for more than seven yards per attempt. He finished his first season in the league with 6.3 and his sophomore campaign with 6.8. Although age is still on Tagovailoa‚Äôs side, time might not be. Miami might well look to unload him in favor of Jimmy Garoppolo.     Heavily criticized for his injury woes, Jimmy Garoppolo played in all 16 of the San Francisco 49ers games in 2019. He played in 15 of their 17 games this past season. When healthy, he is one of the best deep-ball passers in the league. In 2021, he threw for 3,810 yards, at 8.6 yards per attempt. Jimmy Garoppolo is a proven winner. He‚Äôs won 33 of his 47 total starts and has led the 49ers to at least the NFC Championship Game in two of the past three seasons. For a franchise hungry for relevance, he could be a tempting target. #2- Pittsburgh Steelers AFC Wild Card Playoffs - Pittsburgh Steelers v Kansas City Chiefs     Life without quarterback Ben Roethlisberger won‚Äôt be pretty for the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was pretty rough over his last 24 games. They were 11-0 in 2020, but the Steelers have managed a 9-14-1 record since (including two postseason losses). Roethlisberger retired following a heavy Wild Card defeat against the Kansas City Chiefs this past season. Currently, Mitch Trubisky, Mason Rudolph, and the newly drafted Kenny Pickett are all battling it out to win the starting job. Regardless of whoever is chosen, the Steelers will struggle on offense this season.        Rudolph, a former third-round selection in the 2019 NFL Draft, has languished listlessly on the Steelers bench for the past three seasons. When he covered for an injured Roethlisberger, he did not inspire confidence. Rudolph was benched for Devlin ""Duck"" Hodges, who fared no better. Trubisky, on the other hand, enters camp with a bit of an edge over his younger counterparts. Although categorized as a bust, Trubisky has enjoyed moments of success. Trubisky played a major role in pushing the Chicago Bears to prominence, including in 2018, when he made a Pro Bowl appearance. With one of the most explosive defenses in the NFL, spearheaded by T.J. Watt, Pittsburgh are in need of some offensive firepower. Even the best defense will falter if it stays on the field all game, something the Steelers have noted over the last two years. While Garoppolo hasn‚Äôt wowed in terms of his overall production, he does bring consistent performances. He can utilize the best options available, presuming the offensive line will allow him. This was an issue for the Steelers in 2021.     Jimmy Garoppolo\'s winning pedigree may also be too tempting to turn down for the Steelers. Much like his ability to win in the postseason. In two of his three seasons donning a San Francisco 49ers jersey, Garoppolo has led them to at least the NFC Championship Game.  #3- Tennessee Titans AFC Divisional Playoffs - Cincinnati Bengals v Tennessee Titans On paper, comparing the careers of Jimmy Garoppolo and Ryan Tannehill yields unexpected results. Tannehill, the current Tennessee Titans quarterback, has aggregated two seasons of at least 4,000 passing yards. He was also named to the Pro Bowl roster in 2019. Jimmy Garoppolo, on the other hand, is yet to make a Pro Bowl and is viewed as a very conservative thrower of the football.     Yet apprehension sweeps over the Tennessee Titans fanbase when Tannehill takes the field. This past season, he led the Titans to the number one seed in the AFC. Fans watched sullenly as they were sent home in the first round by the Cincinnati Bengals. Garoppolo, while not as distinguished as a pass thrower, wins games. In 47 starts, he has led his franchises to 33 wins. His playoff record is 4-2. Tannehill has a 30-13 record with the Titans and a 72-59 career record as a starter. He is 2-3 in the playoffs.With Garoppolo inserted as Tennessee‚Äôs day one starter, the franchise could take a few steps forward in the playoffs.     ', 'Mike Florio burns NFL Network‚Äôs Ian Rapoport as fallout continues over Jimmy Garoppolo‚Äôs failed physical  Jimmy Garoppolo signed a contract to join the Las Vegas Raiders this offseason. While it appeared he was locked in as their quarterback for the upcoming season, that may not be the case.   According to recently reported details, a clause was added to his contract, essentially giving the Raiders an out if he fails to pass a physical for his injured foot.        Mike Florio said he broke the story about the clause in Garoppolo\'s contract, titled Addendum G, in an exclusive with Pro Football Talk.            Several outlets followed up with their own stories, including NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport. But Florio said that the league-owned news outlet directly stole his story and gave credit to Rapoport for breaking it.

Florio said that the typo remains in the NFL\'s article, while also presenting the story with the exact same phrasing. Being ""first"" to a story is improtant for credibility in the world of reporting. Florio believes his exclusive is being incorrectly credited to Ian Rapoport.         What is Addendum G in Jimmy Garoppolo\'s contract with Raiders? Jimmy Garoppolo Addendum G is a clause in Jimmy Garoppolo\'s contract that serves as a waiver acknowleding that he will initially fail to pass his physical examination due to pre-existing injuries. It provides the Raiders with an out from their responsibility to pay him if he fails to ever pass the physical. They have the right to get out of the contract if he can\'t prove his health before the 2023 NFL season.     According to NBC Sports: ""The waiver becomes null and void if at any time during the 2023 season, Garoppolo passes a physical exam, is active for at least one regular-season game, and does not suffer re-injury to his left foot in the manner described in Addendum G.""As the situation stands, Jimmy Garoppolo has yet to pass a physical examination with the Raiders. If he continues to fail them, the Raiders have the right to cut him without any financial obligation, as per his current contract.

The 2022 off-season pickup by the Broncos punted the ball ten times for 476 yards against the 49ers.     More importantly, six of his ten punts landed inside the 49ers\' 20-yard line, which proved crucial. One of his punts was fielded by his teammates at the 49ers\' 2-yard line, and just two plays later, the Broncos defense forced a safety, which cut their deficit to two.

Russell Wilson engineered an impressive touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter to help the Broncos add six points to their score but struggled to move the ball downfield all night long. He completed 20 of his 33 pass attempts for 184 yards with no touchdown passes or interceptions. He was also sacked four times.

He led the San Francisco 49ers to a 35-7 win over the Bucs.  Everyone was impressed by Purdy\'s performance. He stepped in to replace Jimmy Garoppolo. Joy Taylor was quite delighted with how Purdy performed and claimed that people are not giving him much credit for what he did against Tom Brady.

That was bleeping impressive. I don\'t know if we\'re actually giving Brock Purdy as much credit as we need to. We were of tripping over ourselves to praise Baker Mayfield for what happened on Thursday night, which was impressive."" She continued: ""But this is a rookie quarterback, the last pick in the draft. But like, are we contextualizing this enough properly? That was an a*s-kicking. And they prepared for him.""     Joy Taylor added: ""He was so impressive. He was so decisive. He was moving around in the pocket making plays fully confident. I mean, yes, everything around him is great.""    In the game against the Buccaneers, Purdy completed 16/21 of his throws for 185 yards and two touchdowns. He rushed in for a touchdown as well and had an exceptional passer rating of 134. Although the Bucs were missing many key players in their defensive unit, it was still a great performance by ""Mr. Irrelevant"". He didn\'t let the San Francisco 49ers miss Jimmy Garoppolo, and that\'s a great achievement.     NFL@NFLIt\'s always an awesome moment to meet up with the  postgame...Especially for @brockpurdy13.

Brock Purdy: Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. San Francisco 49ers     Jimmy Garoppolo, broke his foot in the game against the Miami Dolphins, is expected to return this season in the playoffs. He is unlikely to be available for the Wildcard Round but could feature in the Divisional Round. The 49ers still have enough talent on the team to reach the Divisional Round, but Purdy needs to be at his best. However, if Purdy continues to play as he did against the Buccaneers, it is possible that Kyle Shanahan will continue with him even when Jimmy G is back. Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterSources: Doctors concluded today that 49ers\' QB Jimmy Garoppolo does not need foot surgery, it is not a Lisfranc injury, and if rehab goes smoothly, he could have a chance to return in 7-8 weeks, making him a potential playoff contributor.168931990     Jimmy Garoppolo stepped in to replace Trey Lance and played well, similar to what Purdy is doing now.

The film is a retelling of William Shakespeare‚Äôs Romeo and Juliet from the perspective of Rosaline Capulet aka Romeo‚Äôs ex-lover. Although the perspective is refreshing, it is hard to tell exactly what Maine is aiming to achieve with its latest rendition.  The movie does little to establish the protagonist as anyone else other than a stubborn young girl who detests arranged marriages. Although she is a cartographer, the film does little to explore her talents as one. While the background and time period during which Romeo and Juliet are set could contribute to her restrictions, the film still comes off as tokenistic.           All the film does is depict a stubborn, arrogant, yet witty girl born in the safety net of her father‚Äôs status, hence, the attitude. Based on Rebecca Serle‚Äôs book When You Were Mine, the movie features a cast of Kaitlyn Dever as the titular character, Kyle Allen as Romeo, Isabela Merced as Juliet, Sean Teale as Dario, Minnie Driver as Janet the Nurse, Bradley Whitford as Friar Laurence, Spencer Stevenson as Paris, Christopher McDonald as Lord Capulet, Nicholas Rowe as Lord Montague, Nico Hiraga as Steve the Courier, and Alistair Toovey as Tybalt.      Rosaline film review: An abrupt film that scoffs at the absurdities of the Shakespearean tragedy as well as social norms  Rosaline seems to be similar to the story of Edwina Sharma and Kate Sharma from Bridgerton season 2 set in Shakespearean Italy. The film began with the famous balcony scene of Romeo and Juliet, wherein Romeo climbed up the Capulet orchard to meet his lover, Juliet. In this case, he climbs the same to meet Rosaline.     Born into the Capulet family, Juliet‚Äôs cousin Rosaline is un-ladylike barring her attire. She is the only maiden of her age who intended to be a cartographer, is a book lover, and hangs the uniform expression of ‚Äúwhat the hell are you talking about?‚Äù throughout the film. An outcast is what the protagonist is. She roamed the city with her friend Paris, who is gay, and wished to travel the world with the one she loved. But things did not turn out as per her plan. An off-putting moment arrived when Romeo and Rosaline made castles in the air, and the former said that when they lived together, the latter could look after the children and take care of the house while he would be away writing sonnets.      His ladylove‚Äôs reaction: ‚ÄúWhile you‚Äôre off writing verses, I‚Äôm home changing diapers?‚Äù A valid question but without a background. Shakespeare‚Äôs Rosaline was a prop for Romeo and Juliet to cross each other‚Äôs paths. She did not reciprocate Romeo‚Äôs love, which sent him looking for it elsewhere, because she wished to remain chaste. What is the motivation behind the latest Rosaline the Rebel? A past that made her who she is because the mother was absent, or just the fact that her retelling came timely in the 21st century? Even Kate Sharma‚Äôs character in season 2 of Bridgerton had a stronger arc in terms of context. She was born to Indian parents in colonial India, and lost both. An orphan Kate was taken in by her step-mother, while her step-sister became her world. An over-protective Kate was straightforward and a no-nonsense person because she dealt with the real world.     What did Rosaline do? Nothing. While the difference in the time period between Bridgerton and the Hulu film is logical, their nature as fictional characters who can be twisted and tweaked cannot be overlooked either. Thus, a silent response instead of the expected ""I love you, too,"" took Romeo away from Rosaline. What followed was a 96-minute-long visual polarization of the archaic from the modern. The film employed language as one of the biggest and funniest ways to create the distinction. While poetic English was relegated to characters (like Romeo himself) who were overwhelmed with traditions and the norms of society, the representatives of the forward and progressive movement resorted to a loose American English. This was refreshing to watch.      Rosaline‚Äôs father said, ‚ÄúYou are a woman. You are not supposed to talk about what you want.‚Äù  Janet the Nurse, on the other hand, referred to the protagonist as a chicken, perhaps as a term for endearment. Steve the Courier used the lingo of ‚ÄúWhat up‚Äù and ‚Äúpops‚Äù instead of the typical English greetings. Although certain exchanges between Rosaline and Dario made for a hilarious watch, this review admits to being unable to go beyond the sarcastic exchanges between Kate Sharma and Anthony Bridgerton in the Netflix series. However progressive this latest comedic retelling of the Shakespearean tragedy tried to be, it ended up being a hopeless romantic film just like most other romantic comedies. But the question arose: Has love got anything to do with rationality? Although the film did not answer it clearly, Dario‚Äôs words ‚ÄúIt (love) isn‚Äôt rational‚Äù explained the film‚Äôs sentiment and inclination.     Some redeeming qualities of the film include references, although scant, to female sexuality, independence, and identity. The conclusion between Romeo and Juliet is hilarious and is undoubtedly the highlight of an otherwise abrupt film. All in all, it is just another wannabe-progressive film with hardly any effort put after it.The performances are adequate, and even theatrical at certain points. But it could be intentional to explain the difference between traditional and modern. A longer film with more on the titular heroine could, perhaps, have done justice to the efforts of the retelling.Rosaline is currently streaming on Hulu.

', ""A Haunting in Venice: Release date, trailer, cast, and everything we know so far  The highly anticipated Agatha Christie book adaptation A Haunting in Venice is set to premiere on the big screen on September 15, 2023. The movie entails the story of Detective Hercule Poirot, a staple in Agatha Christie's novels, who is now retired and lives sequestered in Venice and is invited to a seance. When one of the guests is murdered at the scene of the seance, it is up to the detective to solve the case.  The supernatural thriller promises to hit it off the park with what is considered to be its most unpredictable installment yet, with a star-studded cast to add to the flair. The official synopsis from 20th Century Studios reads:        ‚ÄúA Haunting in Venice‚Äù is set in eerie, post-World War II Venice on All Hallows‚Äô Eve, ‚ÄúA Haunting in Venice‚Äù is a terrifying mystery featuring the return of the celebrated sleuth, Hercule Poirot. Now retired and living in self-imposed exile in the world‚Äôs most glamorous city, Poirot reluctantly attends a s√©ance at a decaying, haunted palazzo. When one of the guests is murdered, the detective is thrust into a sinister world of shadows and secrets. The modern Agatha Christie book adaptation first debuted in 2017 with the blockbuster film Murder on the Orient Express. The film garnered worldwide appreciation and has since managed to build a huge fandom for mystery and crime movies. The trend continued with the second installment of these adaptations with Death on the Nile in 2022, which was also the first of its kind and raised the bar for mystery and thriller movies in the industry.     The new movie is based on the Agatha Christie novel Hallowe'en Party and houses names like Kenneth Branagh, Michelle Yeoh, Jamie Dornan, and Tina Fey, among many others.

A Haunting in Venice promises to be an exciting adventure for fans         Throughout the years, Agatha Christie has been termed the Queen of Crime, as a consequence of not only her shocking surprises at the end of each novel but also her excellent portrayal of characters and scenery that makes the average reader even more intrigued and engrossed in the story. The trailer for A Haunting in Venice manages to do exactly that. With filming locations of the movie ranging from Venice to London, the preview manages to bring forth an ominous and spooky vibe that fits in with the trademark Agatha Christie specialties. The preview also shows the actors' impressive performances in their respective roles and fans can expect them to do justice to the iconic characters of the novel. However, the film cannot be termed an authentic copy of the 1969 novel since the film also has an added element of the supernatural, something that is missing from the original plotline of the novel. It will be interesting to see how the film manages to add this arc to the already well-established plotline. This exciting aspect of the film has already caught the attention of many and viewers can expect to go through an absolute rollercoaster of emotions.

42,Blake Bortles,"[""NFL Training Camp 2021: 5 Green Bay Packers players on the roster bubble\xa0  Reigning NFC North champions Green Bay Packers have high hopes entering the 2021 NFL season. They've made back-to-back NFC Championship games over the past two seasons and will be looking at another Super Bowl appearance in 2022.  Spots on the Packers roster will be hotly contested during this year‚Äôs training camp with some of last season‚Äôs contributors likely to miss out.                   Packers players who need big training camp performances           View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Green Bay Packers (@packers)  #1 - Josh Jackson The 25-year-old cornerback has not lived up to his potential since he was drafted 45th overall by the Green Bay Packers in the 2018 NFL Draft. He recorded just 21 tackles last season, doing so in limited game time. Green Bay drafted another cornerback, Eric Stokes, in the first round of this year‚Äôs draft, which means Jackson‚Äôs time in Green Bay may be nearly up. The Packers could look for a late-round draft pick for the young cornerback.      #2 - Malik Taylor Wide receiver Malik Taylor needs a big training camp to solidify his spot on the Packers active roster. The six-foot-one, 220-pound Taylor has yet to make his mark at Lambeau Field, starting just one game last season. The 25-year-old backup wideout had only five receptions for 66 yards in 2020 in limited game time. The arrival of rookie slot receiver Amari Rodgers puts even more pressure on Taylor to stand out at training camp.  #3 - Jace Sternberger Backup tight end Jace Sternberger could be on his way out of Lambeau Field this year. On June 10, he was suspended for two games after violating the NFL‚Äôs substance abuse policy. The suspension, added to a lack of production when he was given the opportunity, sees him on the Packers roster bubble. Over his two seasons with Green Bay, he has played in 13 games with 114 yards receiving and one touchdown.  #4 - Dexter Williams     Running back Dexter Williams has seen very little game time since being drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the sixth round of the 2019 NFL Draft. He only carried the ball twice last season for the Packers for eight total yards. Green Bay drafted another running back, Kylin Hill, this year and Williams will be under immense pressure to hold onto his active roster spot.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Green Bay Packers (@packers)  #5 - Blake Bortles If star quarterback Aaron Rodgers decides to end his holdout and return to Lambeau for this year‚Äôs training camp, Blake Bortles could be cut or traded. The veteran NFL quarterback was signed by the Packers this off-season before mini-camp.     Green Bay has also signed backup quarterback Kurt Benkert, and it seems unlikely that Blake Bortles will be needed if Rodgers returns. The Packers could look to trade the 29-year-old QB to a team like the New York Jets, who are short of a veteran play-caller.The former Jacksonville Jaguars starting QB led the franchise to the NFL playoffs in 2017.     "", ""Predicting the top three candidates for NFL Comeback Player of the Year in 2022  The NFL can be a very unforgiving environment at times. Players are always just one bad tackle or landing from retirement. The careers of some of the greatest prospects can be derailed, with the player returning to the NFL diminished. The majority of players suffer at least one gruesome injury during their careers, but they always try their best to return to the league.  The NFL Comeback Player of the Year award is awarded to players who missed significant time in a campaign, only to return in earnest. The award is about overcoming adversity and is not always about returning from injury. Sometimes a player is benched and has to break out and prove himself.        Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals won the award for the 2021 NFL season. The Bengals quarterback tore his ACL in a tackle in his rookie year during the 2020 campaign. There were concerns he would be the same player upon his return. These concerns proved unfounded. Burrow threw for 4,611 yards and 34 touchdowns in the 2021 NFL season. His performances led the Bengals to the Super Bowl, where they fell to the Los Angeles Rams.           Here are my top three candidates to take home Comeback Player of the Year honors in the upcoming season: #1. Christian McCaffrey, Carolina Panthers Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey     Call me an eternal optimist, but I will or have drafted Christian McCaffrey anywhere from the second pick of my NFL fantasy drafts onwards. Mainly because he has been a historically great statistical performer and a really fun player to watch when healthy. McCaffrey has been limited to just ten games over the last two years by shoulder, thigh, hamstring and ankle injuries. This is obviously assuming that he can finally stay healthy in 2022. The Riot Report@RRiotReportYou can't ever get tired of watching Christian McCaffrey highlights.The dual-threat RB turns 26 today and #Panthers fans can't wait to see him back on the field.:@NFL41756 Looking at the pieces around him, unless you count like the last one-and-a-half years of banged-up Cam Newton, Baker Mayfield may be the best quarterback McCaffrey has played with. You may not be a fan of Ben McAdoo as a head coach, but looking at how the New York Giants have fallen apart since his departure and considering how quick-paced his offenses are, the scheme could create more space for the back. Especially with a talented group of receivers around him.     Most importantly, I don‚Äôt believe people acknowledge how much better the Carolina Panthers O-line could be. I expect them to improve at three spots, with sixth overall pick Ikem Ekwonu and a couple of solid veterans. When he last played a full season (2019), McCaffrey led the league with 2,400 scrimmage yards and 19 TDs. #2. Allen Robinson, Los Angeles Rams Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Allen Robinson A different comeback story may be written for Allen Robinson in the City of Angels. This guy has basically been in quarterback purgatory ever since he came to Penn State. Blake Bortles probably remains the best guy he‚Äôs caught passes from ever since then, before kind of shutting it down since December last year. Robinson was still able to produce despite that.     Bleacher Nation Bears@BN_BearsMy gift to you on Allen Robinson‚Äôs birthday: 2 minutes of highlights featuring some of the best hands in football. ü•≥   1899 If you take out his first and most recent year in the pros respectively (along with 2017, when he was lost for the year after just one catch), he has averaged 1,087 yards and 7.4 touchdowns per season. Whether he was used on the perimeter as a vertical, ball-winning receiver or running option routes from the slot, Robinson can and has done pretty much everything. He now gets to play under Sean McVay and the Los Angeles Rams. In the upcoming NFL campaign, he has Matthew Stafford throwing him the ball. Stafford has only failed to go over 4,000 passing yards once since 2011 (when he was limited to just eight games). Looking at how they used Odell Beckham Jr. as their X receiver last season, particularly as a designated red-zone target near the goal-line, but also to some degree Robert Woods, I could easily see him go for 1,200 yards and double-digit touchdowns.     Also Checkout:- NFL Most Valuable Teams #3. Saquon Barkley, New York Giants New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley Finally, the optimist in me also had to put up Saquon Barkley here. He headlined my list last season and barely made an impact at all, due to constantly being banged up yet again. So once more, I‚Äôm working under the assumption that he won‚Äôt land badly, twisting his ankle or knee, which has caused him to miss more games than he's played across the past two seasons.     I believe because he has tried to tough it out and hasn‚Äôt looked like himself, people think he‚Äôs washed. I refuse to not look at him as an elite draft prospect and talent in the running back position. His combination of burst, lower body strength, natural receiving skills and his break-away speed made him the NFL‚Äôs leader in scrimmage yards as a rookie back in 2018. Athlete Swag@AthleteSwagSaquon Barkley‚Äôs highlights set to the Space Jam soundtrack is perfect773238 The following season I‚Äôd argue the Giants had the worst O-line in the league and then of course the injuries started to hit. Considering Big Blue now have two tackles from top-ten picks and added a couple of above-average starting veterans on the interior, that unit has seen an immense upgrade.     Then you have Brian Daboll and Mike Kafka opening up what has been a very underwhelming offensive structure. Combine this with the more dynamic receiving talent around him and Saquon Barkley will remind people of the player he is in this NFL season.If you enjoyed this breakdown, please make sure to check out the original piece, where I also predict all the other awards and the playoff picture, leading up to Super Bowl LVII.     "", ""When was Aaron Donald drafted?  Los Angeles Rams' legend Aaron Donald was drafted in 2014 by the then-St. Louis Rams. Donald was selected as the 13th pick in the first round of the 2014 Draft out of Pittsburgh University.  The Rams drafted Donald due to his elite performances at the college level, his versatility on defense, and his freakishly strong frame.

Donald has racked up many accolades in his nine years, including three NFL Defensive Player of the Year Awards, seven first-team All-Pro selections, nine Pro Bowl selections, and a Super Bowl win (LVI). He has been a pivotal part of the Rams' defense from the moment he stepped into the locker room to this very moment.     Aaron Donald is the primary reason the Los Angeles Rams came out victorious in Super Bowl LVI, as he kept the Cincinnati Bengals offense at bay. Donald has put up an impressive stat line of 489 tackles, 103 sacks, and 24 forced fumbles in 138 games.

Elite quarterbacks have the ability to make any team good, even when the rest of their roster is mediocre or worse.  Bad quarterbacks, on the other hand, can completely waste a team‚Äôs chances when the rest of the roster is elite. Here are five of the best teams in NFL history whose fates were doomed by poor quarterback play.                   #5 - 2017 Jacksonville Jaguars Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles Like many of the teams who will appear on this list, the 2017 Jacksonville Jaguars were powered by a dominant defense. They were the top-ranked defense in the AFC and the second-ranked defense in the NFL during the 2017 season based on points allowed per game. Their defense, led by Jalen Ramsey, carried them to a 10-6 record in the regular season and all the way to the AFC Championship game in the playoffs.     Sosa Kremenjas@QBsMVPJalen Ramsey explaining to @AqibTalib21 how the entire Jags locker room disliked Tom Coughlin. This pod is worth every minute and then some.24669 Blake Bortles was mediocre at best during the 2017 regular season, throwing 21 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. He completed less than 60 percent of his passes in the playoffs. While he didn\'t necessarily hurt the Jaguars, he wasn\'t helping either. A legitimate quarterback could have resulted in a Super Bowl ring.  #4 - 2010 New York Jets New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez     The New York Jets made it all the way to the AFC Championship game for consecutive years, in the 2009 and 2010 NFL seasons. Head coach Rex Ryan and his notoriously aggressive style of defense was their trademark.     The 2010 Jets team is one of the best in franchise history. Their only problem was a below-average quarterback, as they were solid everywhere else. Mark Sanchez completed less than 55 percent of his passes for just 17 touchdowns with 13 interceptions that season. That was, interestingly, one of his best seasons.     #3 - 2012 Chicago Bears Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA) is a statistical category that measures the overall strength of a team‚Äôs offense and defense based on their efficiency percentage against the league average. The 2012 Chicago Bears defense had the best DVOA of the season by far and was one of the top 15 of all time. Charles ""Peanut"" Tillman stood out with ten forced fumbles and three interceptions that were returned for touchdowns.         The 2012 Bears also received a monstrous performance from wide receiver Brandon Marshall, who set a franchise record of 1,508 receiving yards. The historic defense and dominant wide receiver weren\'t enough to overcome quarterback Jay Cutler, who completed less than 60 percent of his passes and threw 14 interceptions. The Bears didn\'t even make the 2012 NFL Playoffs.  #2 - 2004 Buffalo Bills Buffalo Bills quarterback Drew Bledsoe The 2004 Buffalo Bills had a historically good defense and were even better than the previously mentioned 2012 Bears based on DVOA. The 2004 Bills defense is one of the top 10 defenses of all time based on DVOA and has been in the top five since the statistics began being officially recorded.     Their defense was loaded with talent and led the NFL with a massive 39 interceptions.     While Drew Bledsoe didn\'t have a terrible season, he didn\'t do enough to help the Bills win. He completed less than 57 percent of his passes for fewer than 3,000 yards while throwing 16 interceptions that season. With better quarterback play, they could have been true Super Bowl contenders. But instead, they missed out on the 2004 NFL Playoffs.  #1 - 1991 Philadelphia Eagles Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Randall Cunningham     The 1991 Philadelphia Eagles are the best defense in NFL history based on DVOA by a wide margin. The difference between the 1991 Eagles DVOA and the second-place 1985 Chicago Bears is greater than the difference between second place and the 25th place. Their legendary defensive line, anchored by Reggie White, has three All-Pros who combined for a massive 37 sacks between them while the team recorded 55 sacks. This Day In Sports Clips@TDISportsClipsDecember 2, 1990: In Buffalo, Randall Cunningham avoids a safety by ducking under Bruce Smith who was charging from behind him in the end zone, rolls out and throws it 50+ yards in the air to Fred Barnett who catches it and takes it for a 95-yd TD.1485230 Despite starting quarterback Randall Cunningham suffering a season-ending injury in Week 1, they still went 10-6 in the regular season with poor back-up quarterbacks. The Eagles were legitimate Super Bowl contenders with a healthy Cunningham, but without him they fell short of the NFL playoffs.

He has won a Super Bowl, an MVP award, and has been named to the Pro Bowl every year he‚Äôs started in the league. He‚Äôs also got one of the best records in the league, winning 50 games in just 63 starts.  He has a resum√© to match anyone‚Äôs and he‚Äôs thrown 151 touchdowns and 18,991 yards in just four years as a starter.

Yes FIFTY. 23-year-old Patrick Mahomes just threw his 50th touchdown this season.185393536           However, he hasn‚Äôt always had it his own way. Even though he plays well most Sundays, there have been times he‚Äôs had a horror show. Here are Patrick Mahomes' three worst NFL games: #3 - vs Jacksonville Jaguars, 2018 Jacksonville Jaguars v Kansas City Chiefs     Mahomes didn't have his best game during his first year as a starter when the Chiefs faced the Jacksonville Jaguars. Despite Kansas City winning 30-14, the Texas Tech product only completed 22 of 38 passes. While he did manage to pass for 313 yards, he didn‚Äôt pass for a touchdown, instead throwing two interceptions. He ended the day with a passer rating of just 62.7, and was only marginally better than the quarterback on the opposing bench that day, Blake Bortles. Mahomes will admit that he was lucky the Chiefs‚Äô defence were on form that day, clocking up five sacks and two interceptions. #2 - vs Denver Broncos, 2021 Denver Broncos v Kansas City Chiefs     One of the worst games of his career came last season, when the Chiefs faced their division rival, the Denver Broncos. The Chiefs won 22-9, but their quarterback only passed for 184 yards, completing just 15 out of 29 passes. His completion percentage was just 51.7%, and to top it off, he only mustered up a passer rating of 57.3, the lowest of his career, according to statmuse.com.  He did run a touchdown in, but it was a rarity to see Mahomes end the day without a passing touchdown, a feat that has only occurred six times in his career thus far. #1 - vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 2020 Super Bowl LV - Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs Kansas City Chiefs     The one game that springs to mind when it comes to Patrick Mahomes‚Äô worst career game is Super Bowl LV. In this game, the Chiefs were taken down 31-9 by Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Mahomes was under duress throughout the game, as he only managed 270 passing yards, zero touchdowns and two interceptions. He was sacked three times and found Buccaneers defenders all over him on every play. The Chiefs‚Äô offensive line crumbled in the big game and the quarterback was running for his life. His passer rating was just 52.3 as he completed just 26 of his 49 passes as Kansas City fell apart in Miami.Doug Kyed@DougKyedSuper Bowl LV passer ratings:Tom Brady: 140.1Patrick Mahomes: 37.43105399     "", 'NFL Divisional Round predictions  The Divisional Round is upon us and it is time to take a look at which teams are primed to move on to the Championship Round. After some surprising results on Wild Card Weekend, most notably the Titans\' stunning comeback to upset the Chiefs, nobody appears to be safe in what could be one of the most exciting playoff pictures to date.          #1 Atlanta Falcons @ Philadelphia Eagles            The Falcons came to play in their impressive 26-13 road victory over a Rams team that was considered to be a dark horse on the road to the Super Bowl. While Julio Jones slowly started to hit his stride, gaining 94 yards on 9 receptions and a touchdown, it was the defence and special teams that came up huge for them. The sixth seed took advantage of the Rams\' special teams that inflicted damage on themselves by fluffing a punt recovery and fumbling during a kick-off return in the first half, plays that set up 10 of the Falcons\' 13 first-half points. It was only in the second half that the offence started to show up, despite there being a lack of threat in the red zone (highlighted by Matt Bryant\'s nine(!) field goals in the last two games).     The Eagles, on the other hand, have been thrown a much-needed lifeline. Welcoming Atlanta to Lincoln Financial Field this Saturday seems to be a far more promising prospect than facing the Rams. Their defence will fancy their chances against a struggling offence that can\'t consistently come up with the necessary plays to move the sticks the way they did last year. Of course, the Falcons\' defence had a strong showing last weekend and will provide a tough task for Doug Peterson\'s team to overcome, but their pass rush is not as ferocious as that of the eliminated third seed. This will allow Nick Foles more time to make the right decisions in what could turn out to be a nail-biter. Prediction: Falcons win 24-21 #2 Tennessee Titans @ New England Patriots      Well, before Wild Card Weekend, I wasn\'t expecting to be involving the Titans in this article. But at halftime with the scoreline at 21-3 in favour of the Chiefs, I was absolutely convinced they were already eliminated. There was not a single aspect of this game that allowed you to think the Titans would overcome the odds. Then Marcus Mariota completed that touchdown pass to himself (yes, you read that correctly) and suddenly it turned into an entirely different ball game. If the Titans are to survive this trip to Foxborough, they will need more than just lady luck on their side. Second-year running back Derrick Henry will have to perform at a similar level he did at Arrowhead, where he rushed for 156 yards on 23 carries. Additionally, Mariota will have to elevate his play from ""solid"" to ""elite"" within a week and the defence will have to show up on every single snap - then, when all of this comes together, luck may be the factor that could tilt the match-up in their favour.     The Patriots, on the other hand, will be looking forward to seeing the Titans rather than the Chiefs enter Gillette Stadium. With the Chiefs already having beaten them once in Foxborough this season, the Titans are unlikely to provide the explosive threat that conquered the champions. Coming off the bye-week, the Patriots will be feeling fresh and ready to start their next Super Bowl run. Frankly, it would take a miracle for the Titans to defeat the Patriots and move on to the next round. Belichick\'s team hasn\'t lost a home game in the playoffs since the 2012 Championship Round (13-28 vs the Ravens) and with Tom Brady coming off yet another MVP-caliber season will be unlikely to so against the surprise package of the AFC. Prediction: Patriots win 34-13 #3 Jacksonville Jaguars @ Pittsburgh Steelers      Arguably the most intriguing match-up of the Playoffs so far, the Jaguars travel to Heinz Field surviving a close encounter with the Bills. The most important question from Jacksonville\'s perspective was answered in their 10-3 home victory - the defence is as strong as ever and will look to carry this team all the way for the first time in franchise history. Somewhat confusing, however, was just how much their offence struggled to gain yardage against the Bills\' tough defensive unit. Blake Bortles actually ran for more yards (88) than he threw (87) and this is truly worrying for Jaguars\' coaching staff. Defence can win you championships, but you also need some sort of offence to accompany it. If your most effective way of gaining first downs is your 6\'5\'\' quarterback rushing on option plays then you are inevitably going to struggle at some point. One thing the third seed won\'t be able to rely upon is their opponents being held to 3 meagre points again. The Steelers\' offence is just too good and too versatile to be held at bay the way the Bills were. If the Jaguars are to progress Leonard Fournette will have to rediscover his regular season form and, more importantly, Bortles will need to come up with more passing plays.     The Steelers then again are facing a group that has troubled them a lot at Heinz Field, most recently the Jaguars destroyed them 30-9 in October this season, despite Antonio Brown receiving for 157 yards. This could turn out to be the closest game of the Divisional Round, a lot will depend on the outcome of the marquee match-up between the teams\' star players: Antonio Brown and Jalen Ramsay. Prediction: Steelers win 20-17 #4 New Orleans Saints @ Minnesota Vikings      Now, this is what Playoff football is all about. If this game turns out to be anywhere near as spectacular as it plays out on paper, we\'re in for some fantastic entertainment on Sunday evening. The vintage performance of Drew Brees in the 31-26 Wild Card Round-victory over the Panthers just makes it all the more interesting. The Saints had to fight until the very end to ensure their survival in the Playoffs with Cam Newton throwing for 349y during an exciting contest. New Orleans\' defence however held on when it mattered the most and their team is now headed to the U.S. Bank Stadium, where they are hoping to find themselves again on February 4th. The most surprising takeaway from the hard-fought match-up with the Panthers is that Ingram and Kamara couldn\'t get going and the Saints turned back to their most trusted strategy of the past years - giving the ball to Brees and letting him work his magic.     Brees ended up throwing for 376 yards and two touchdowns, without any significant running game in support. If the running back-tandem can turn the corner on Sunday, the Vikings may be facing the most dangerous offence in the NFL right now. The Vikings themselves, however, boast an elite defensive unit on par with that of the Jaguars. Their hopes will, therefore, rest on Case Keenum\'s shoulders, he will need to replicate his regular season outings to outscore a Saints offence that seems impossible to contain throughout the entirety of a match. This may be the hardest obstacle for Minnesota to overcome on their way to a hometown-Super Bowl and this is primed to be an exciting contest to close out the Divisional Round Prediction: Saints win 27-24      Quick Links       New Orleans Saints   Minnesota Vikings        More from Sportskeeda       Edited by anirudh.b         √ó               Feedback  Thank You!

Now having watched every single matchup, I came away with one observation for each NFL squad. Here's what you need to know            Oakland Raiders ‚Äì This Jon Gruden thing could go pretty wrong Unlike a lot of people, I wasn‚Äôt worried too much about Gruden not being able to adjust to the modern game and adapt different offensive schemes. I like the toughness he wants to install into his players, I think he has gained insight into different coaches with TV production meetings and I believe he is the type of flashy hire the Raiders needed after announcing they would move to Las Vegas. Regardless of all those factors, I have yet to see him display touch with this generation of players and his feel for the flow of a game in real-time. His comment about ‚Äúneeding a pass rush‚Äù after their loss to the Rams was almost comical and I thought it was pretty harsh to put all the blame on Khalil Mack for saying ‚Äú he didn‚Äôt want to be on the team‚Äù, but more importantly their offense got stuck in the mud after their portion of scripted plays and when it was time to react to how the game progressed.Tampa Bay Buccaneers ‚Äì Ryan Fitzpatrick might be the streakiest passer in NFL history     This was the biggest upset of the week and I don‚Äôt think there was anybody in the media who predicted that the Bucs could stun a popular Super Bowl pick at the Dome. However, nobody expected to see more Fitzmagic in this matchup either. The Harvard graduate has been a journeyman throughout his NFL career, having played and started for seven different franchises. He came to all but one team as a backup, but somehow always ended up in the starting lineup eventually. Fitzy has had some brilliant moments, like a six-touchdown outing against the Titans in 2014 after being benched by the Texans three weeks earlier and he set the Jets‚Äô franchise record for passing touchdown in a season with 31 in 2015, but plenty of times after those heroic performances, he has stunk the following week. Last Sunday was another one of those brilliant moments, when he played an almost perfect game and might have already started a quarterback controversy in Tampa     Atlanta Falcons ‚Äì Steve Sarkisian still is a horrific play-caller I don‚Äôt enjoy bashing coaches and calling for anybody‚Äôs job, but it‚Äôs just frustrating to watch this Falcons offense have so much talent and have it go to waste. I appreciate the fact that Sarkisian made it a priority to find ways to put the ball into the hands of his best player, but he just doesn‚Äôt seem to have a clear plan on how to feature his arsenal of playmakers. First-round pick Calvin Ridley didn‚Äôt catch a single pass, despite already being an outstanding route-runner and what he showed in preseason, plus the Eagles didn‚Äôt have anybody capable of covering Freeman or Coleman having without Nigel Bradham in the lineup. More importantly though, those red-zone trips were just embarrassing. For all the times Sark has been critiqued for not targeting Julio on the red-zone, he has tried to make up for it by zeroing in on number 11 in two games versus the Eagles, despite facing double-coverage constantly. At least he put him in a stack once to give him a free release, but you have to give the guys with one-on-one opportunities a chance.      Baltimore Ravens ‚Äì That defense is nasty This franchise has always been known for tough, physical defenses and last year they already looked like one of the dominant units for most of the year, as they led the league in takeaways and pitched three different shutouts throughout the season. With that being said, they might be even more terrifying in 2018 and they started things of right with a 47-3 hammering of the Buffalo Bills. The Baltimore front controlled the line of scrimmage the entire game and completely shut down the Bills‚Äô rushing attack, forcing Nathan Peterman to beat them with his arm. After throwing two picks and putting up a QB rating of 0.0 they sent out Josh Allen in the second half, but the only real success he had came on the ground, as he outrushed LeSean McCoy with 26 yards. That performance is even more impressive considering the Ravens were without their top cornerback in Jimmy Smith. Baltimore goes five guys deep at edge rusher, C.J. Mosley is a perennial Pro Bowler and their secondary is full of ball-hawks.     Buffalo Bills ‚Äì The Nathan Peterman era is over After finally reaching the playoffs for the first time in 20 years, the Bills were due to regress after trading quarterback Tyrod Taylor and drafting developmental prospects at quarterback and linebacker. They brought in A.J. McCarron to go with seventh overall pick Josh Allen, but decided to trade him a week before the regular season as they chose Nathan Peterman as their starter under center. We all remember the mistake they made pulling Tyrod for him last year, as he threw five picks in just the first half versus the Chargers and he had an even worse performance in the season-opener. Peterman completed 5 of his 18 pass attempts for 24 yards, no touchdowns, two interceptions and a QB rating of zero, while not picking up a single first down. The offensive line has been a mess as well and the pass-catcher haven‚Äôt really helped him out either, but I think the second-year man is only out there to take the hits until Josh Allen is ready to go.      Carolina Panthers ‚Äì A running Cam Newton scares defenses Outside of his MVP season Cam Newton averages a completion percentage of 59.4, 288 passing yards per game, 20.5 touchdowns a season and a quarterback rating of 83.2. Everybody who has been reading my blog for the last five years knows I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the Panthers quarterback and for detail on why you can read more of my content or ask me directly. With that being said ‚Äì boy, is that guy scary when he takes off. At 6‚Äô6‚Äù, 250 pounds Superman is as tough to bring down as anybody in the league and the Cowboys got to know that first hand once again on Sunday. Cam ran the ball 10 times for 58 yards and a touchdown, with all but one of those rushing attempts coming off zone-read plays or designed QB runs. The yardage total should even be six yards higher considering the Panthers ended the game by taking a knee three times for minus six yards. Cam is a beast as a runner and you always have to pay attention to him.     Chicago Bears ‚Äì This team is for real I know they just gave up a 20:0 lead, but I don‚Äôt want to hear anybody say that the Bears choked or anything like that. The offense moved the ball (even if they had to settle for field goals) even for most of the second half and they made Aaron Rodgers move around on a bad knee. They just were a victim of the game‚Äôs best QB smelling blood in the water. Matt Nagy is a genius play-caller, who understands how to use the new weapons with movement and misdirection. Tarik Cohen is his version of Tyreek Hill as a gadget player and Mitch Trubisky looks very comfortable in that offense. Khalil Mack was unreal with just one week of practice and this defensive front got after it. Akiem Hicks is a disruptive force and Roquan Smith‚Äôs first play in an NFL game ended up in a sack. This is a dangerous squad.      Cincinnati Bengals ‚Äì Joe Mixon is a playmaker When I looked at last week‚Äôs matchups and I saw Mixon would go up against the Colts defense, I already had him pencilled in as my RB1 for fantasy. Last year as a rookie, the former Oklahoma back was limited to 3.5 yards a carry behind a lacklustre offensive line, but with the additions of Duane Brown via trade and Billy Price in the draft, I expect a big season for the second-year man. A top-twenty talent a year ago, Mixon now with his mind set on the field, where he has looked like a tremendous all-around back in week one versus Indianapolis. Mixon amassed 149 yards from scrimmage on just 22 touches. He displayed balance, burst and power, but more importantly outstanding vision and patience. The screen game with him looked excellent and he has that Le‚ÄôVeon Bell-esque running style. With that being said, he will face a tough test tomorrow night versus Baltimore who held Shady to 22 yards on the ground Sunday.     Cleveland Browns ‚Äì The Browns still haven‚Äôt won a game I understand this is more of a fact than an observation, but let me explain to you what I mean with this. The Browns came into this game with as good a roster as they have had in several years and they were hungry for a W after an 0-16 campaign, especially against a team that had beaten them in 14 of their last 16 meetings. Over the course of the game the Steelers turned the ball over six times and basically handed the Browns the victory. Big Ben threw three picks in the first half, but none of them ended in points for Cleveland. Up 21-7 in the middle of the fourth quarter, they capitalized off a fumble recovery at the PIT one-yard line and having the ball at midfield almost off a punt. Having driven the ball down the field close to field goal range with less than half a minute left, Tyrod tossed an ill-advised pick to send them to overtime. After a series of three-and-outs and a missed Steelers field goal, Genard Avery‚Äôs strip-sack set them up for a 45-yard game-winner themselves, but they saw it blocked by T.J. Watt. I know it officially is a tie, but this was a moral loss for Cleveland, which could have kick-started a new chapter of their franchise‚Äôs history.      Dallas Cowboys ‚Äì Nobody on the outside is ready to win in the passing game Putting the ball into the hands of Zeke just 18 times simply won‚Äôt get it done. The Cowboys need to establish the running game, even without All-Pro center Travis Frederick, to set up opportunities to win on play-action. When Dallas is forced into obvious passing situations, there simply are no receivers, who can win consistently and Dak Prescott is not the type of guy, who will throw them open against man-coverage. On the final two drives of the game the Cowboys had opportunities to move the ball down the field by pushing it outside the numbers, but they counted on Deonte Thompson to make plays. Allen Hurns, Terrance Williams and rookie Michael Gallup all only caught one pass, while Cole Beasley kind of kept them alive by catching seven short passes out of the slot and turning most of them into first downs. The Cowboys better get this ground game going or this could be a long season.     Denver Broncos ‚Äì Von Miller is a freaking beast I originally wanted to talk about how this team is ready to win right now and that Chad Kelly might be the better option under center after Case Keenum almost cost them a win with his three interceptions on Sunday, but oh my god ‚Äì can Von Miller ball. That dude completely wrecked the Seahawks gameplan by recorded three sacks, four QB hurries and forcing two fumbles. He was chasing Russell Wilson around all game long and made Germain Ifedi look like trash. Von got one strip-sack off a stunt with Wilson stepping up into the pocket and the second one he came in from behind on Chris Carson and simply took the ball out of his hands like he was a little baby. This guy is a bad man, who has been wreaking havoc on quarterbacks around the league for seven years now and he is off to a good start to finally win a Defensive Player of the Year award.      Detroit Lions ‚Äì Matthew Stafford is one tough son of a gun I could talk about the four interceptions Stafford threw and they were all pretty bad. I could also talk about a Matt Patricia‚Äôs horrific start to his head coaching career and how his defense made a rookie quarterback look like Tom Brady on Monday night. Yet, I want people to appreciate the toughness Stafford displays constantly. He got knocked around like a rag doll and you saw him limping on and off the field. I thought at some point the coaches should have just pulled him out of the game, but he went to them again and again to say he wants to go out on the field. This was not the first time the Lions QB played through injury. I remember an incredible comeback win against the Browns as a rookie in 2009, when he took a huge shot and could barely move his left arm, but pushed the doctors aside to go back out for the game-winning TD. I also remember a narrow loss to the Panthers last year, when he had his whole leg taped up and blood running down his hand. Nothing will keep this man off the field ‚Äì not even his own medical staff.     Green Bay Packers ‚Äì Aaron Rodgers is the most dangerous man in football This is nothing new to me. Aaron Rodgers has pulled off stuff like this throughout the years and you can never count him and the Packers out, but it‚Äôs been a while since I last saw him work his magic. After being carted off and seeing his team go down by three touchdowns, it was time for the King of the North to take over once again. You could clearly tell that Rodgers had trouble moving and he was playing on guts, but he just carved that Bears defense up from the pocket. That bomb to the back of the end-zone to Geronimo Allison was amazing and I know Randall Cobb gained 65 yards of that 75-yard touchdown after the catch, but even that ability to understand how he will adjust his route where the ball has to be put was surgical. When you don‚Äôt put this man away, there is always a chance he will do unbelievable things.      Houston Texans ‚Äì Deshaun Watson is not totally back yet Deshaun Watson was so incredibly impressive in his injury-shortened rookie campaign that it was almost unfair to expect him to continue that trend in 2018. Going toe-for-toe with Tom Brady and Russell Wilson in shootouts on his way to scoring 20 touchdowns in six starts put him in the national spotlight before tearing his ACL in practice. In his much-anticipated return as a second-year player he didn‚Äôt look the same. Watson put his eyes down on the rush way too often instead of keeping them downfield to make plays. He showed a lack of decisiveness and accuracy down the field. Not only did he complete only 50 percent of his passes, he also threw a pretty bad pick when he was late and short on a deep ball to the end-zone. With that being said, he didn‚Äôt seem to have trouble moving around and he had his team in position to make a late comeback. So let‚Äôs see how quickly he can get back to himself mentally.     Indianapolis Colts ‚Äì Andrew Luck is finally back It was more than 600 days until we last saw Andrew Luck throw a pass in a regular NFL game and he did not disappoint in his comeback. The Colts‚Äô star quarterback didn‚Äôt look good at all in preseason, being late on some throws and simply being hesitant to pull the trigger when he needed to. On Sunday it was time for live competition and Luck was ready to go. He showed mobility, touch and arm strength to rifle in some passes over the middle. He scanned the entire field, showing that he can still process information and understand where to go with the ball. The 29-year old took a vicious cheap-shot to the head by a Bengals safety, but got right back up and went back to work. Luck converted 11 of 15 third downs, including a sack. He gave the Colts the element of the downfield passing back and would have had his team in position for one of his notorious game-winning drives, did Jack Doyle not fumble after a 3-and-15 conversion. Luck made some ill-advised decisions and still needs to get used to the speed of the game, but he looks like Andrew Luck again.      Jacksonville Jaguars ‚Äì They absolutely need to win with their run game and defense The good thing is that the Jags already did that last year, when they led the league in rushing and finished the season 2nd in both yards and points allowed defensively. With the addition of Andrew Norwell to their offensive line and some of the young players on defense gaining more experience, both areas could be even better and they need to be when you look at what they have in the passing game. I like their second-year receivers Dede Westbrook and Keelan Cole, plus I think Austin-Seferian Jenkins can be a mismatch as that flex tight-end, but how can you trust Blake Bortles? He completed 54.5 percent of his passes for 176 yards even though the Giants put everybody they could into the box. His best work came on scrambles. I won‚Äôt put that interception completely on him, because Donte Moncrief turned his head around way too early, allowing Janoris Jenkins to do so as well, but Bortles is not the guy you want to count on to win you games and Leonard Fournette get healthy soon.     Arizona Cardinals ‚Äì Sam Bradford is the check down king It‚Äôs nothing new that Sam Bradford likes to check the ball down underneath and even his then record-setting completion percentage of 71.6 back in 2016 felt like a product of throwing it short of the sticks on third downs constantly. Yet, this Sunday he took it to a different level. Bradford threw 13 underneath passes to his running backs with little room to run, leading to 9 of his 20 completions. I like to see quarterbacks throw it out hot to defeat blitzes and if nothing is there I‚Äôd rather see them check the ball down, but you need to stretch defences vertically and attack the entire field. I know it‚Äôs early and Bradford will have another couple of weeks to prove he can get it done, but eventually it‚Äôs time to put Josh Rosen out there because he (at times to a fault) isn‚Äôt afraid to push the ball down the field.      Kansas City Chiefs ‚Äì Tyreek Hill is by far the biggest homerun hitter in the NFL I almost feel bad for not talking about Patrick Mahomes, because he was amazing. Those sidearm throws, bombs down the field and overall control of the offence makes me question my playoff predictions already. Yet, I want to talk about a different young player, because Tyreek is just a freak. Ever since Hill came into the league in 2016 you knew he was a touchdown waiting to happen. He scored three 80+ yard return touchdowns to go with his nine scores on offence as a rookie. Last Sunday versus the Chiefs he once again proved he is the most electric big-play threat in the game. Hill started the day off with a 91-yard punt return touchdown, but ended the game with 171 yards and two touchdowns on offence as well, including another 58-yard catch-and-run play. You just can‚Äôt blink when you face this guy, because if you do he might already be gone.     Los Angeles Rams ‚Äì You can‚Äôt fall in love with the pass game This is such a talented team. The Rams are loaded at pretty much every single position outside of linebacker. They made some enormous additions on the defensive side of the ball and the offense might be most fun to watch with playmakers all over the yard and Sean McVay‚Äôs creative play-designs. And while I thought their slow start versus the Raiders was more about the lack of live reps than anything else, as they sat most of their starters throughout the preseason, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice one element of their game in particular ‚Äì they got pass-happy. The Rams started the game with a three-and-out before going down the field in consecutive pass plays and then putting the ball into the hands of Todd Gurley on a little touch-pass sweep for a 19-yard score. The following drive they threw it five times while Gurley only touched the ball twice to end the half with just eight-and-a-half minute of possession. Over the final 30 games they handed the ball off to Gurley 17 times, but at the start of the fourth quarter up 23-13 they went back to throwing the ball on eight of their nine plays. Todd Gurley is the engine that makes this offense go and they need to establish him to open up everything else.      Miami Dolphins ‚Äì Adam Gase can elevate an offense with average talent The Dolphins head coach got rid of guys like Jay Ajayi, Jarvis Landry, Mike Pouncey and Ndamokung Suh, who were all very good players but apparently didn‚Äôt fit in with the disciplined Gase. Instead he brought in locker-room guys like Danny Amendola, Frank Gore and Daniel Kilgore, who can help turn around the culture of his franchise. However, that lack of offensive firepower comes at a price when it comes to the talent-level. I think Kenyan Drake is a superstar in the making, but DeVante Parker has yet to show any consistency and Kenny Stills has been a very good number three receiver, who shouldn‚Äôt lead your team in yards. Outside of a badly placed ball on a fade route to rookie Mike Gesicki split out wide and an overthrown deep shot leading to interceptions I thought this offense moved the ball pretty well. They won with clever route-combinations and different alignments.     Minnesota Vikings ‚Äì This is a complete team When you think about the Vikings you think of defense first and deservedly so. That unit held Jimmy Garoppolo to 15 of 33 with one touchdown compared to three interceptions, having taken one of them to the house. More importantly they showed they can follow the gameplan, by keeping the defensive ends home against bootlegs and taking away easy completions. However, they got the job done offensively as well. The 84-million dollar man Kirk Cousins looked confident and has already established good connections with Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen, plus he has shown understanding of play design. Case Keenum had a magical year in 2018, but Cousins is a much better player. Also, Dalvin Cook is a special talent and even though he was limited to 2.5 yards per carry, he made things happen in the quick passing game with six catches for 55 yards.  New England Patriots ‚Äì Gronk is pretty much unstoppable one-on-one     We heard all about the lack of pass-catchers surrounding Brady as we have done in recent years with Brandin Cooks, Danny Amendola and Dion Lewis all gone, but as long as they have Rob Gronkowski they have that one guy who simply can‚Äôt be covered by one man. Throughout the all-world tight-end‚Äôs career there have been very few guys, who have been able to at least slow him and it has really only been those big hits from Bernard Pollard and Earl Thomas that made him less of a locomotive in the middle of the field. Last Sunday the Texans were tasked to come up with a strategy to make Brady‚Äôs number one weapon less effective and they just couldn‚Äôt find a way. They played straight-up, put safeties on him, moved linebacker Zach Cunningham to the outside and shaded him with a safety over the top, but nothing worked. Gronk still ended up with seven catches for 123 yards.     Los Angeles Chargers ‚Äì These guys just can‚Äôt start fast I might have made a mistake. I predicted the Chargers would win 12 games and earn the AFC‚Äôs number one seed. What I forgot or rather what I blindly trusted would change was the fact this team simply can‚Äôt beat the Chiefs (now having lost the last nine meetings) and they don‚Äôt get out of the gates running. Yes, they were without Joey Bosa and yes, Antonio Gates still needs to find his way back, but this team made mistakes in all facets of the game. Philip Rivers threw a crucial pick in field-goal range in the third quarter, they didn‚Äôt run the ball often enough, the defense gave up seven plays of 20+ yards, they allowed a punt return touchdown over the entire field to Tyreek Hill and they still can‚Äôt convert field goals when they really matter, as Caleb Sturgis missed a 48-yarder when the Chargers still had more than a minute and all three timeouts left. I still believe in this team because they are so damn talented, but they better get started because Kansas City looks explosive.      New York Jets ‚Äì Sam Darnold is the Jets‚Äô saviour I had four blue-chip players at the top of my draft board, who I thought were can‚Äôt-miss guys, but right behind them I had Darnold, who also was my clear-cut number one QB and I feel pretty good about that right now. The rookie out of USC already looked very impressive when I watched his preseason tape, with how quickly he diagnosed coverages and processed information. He just doesn‚Äôt seem to get fooled by disguises and doesn‚Äôt show any hesitation when defenses change post-snap, but instead he just simply knows how to adjust and where to go with the ball. Outside of the anticipatory skills and his toughness, it was his even keel attitude that made me believe in him as a pro. That‚Äôs why I thought tossing that pick-six when trying to squeeze in a wheel route to the running back across the field was a perfect start to his career in the sense that you can see how he will respond. He went on to complete 16 of his 20 passes, while going four for four on third downs for 72 yards plus another conversion with his feet. The defense was unbelievable, but finally having that franchise quarterback is the key for Gang Green.      Philadelphia Eagles ‚Äì This team can win ugly games Carson Wentz will likely be out for another couple of weeks and no matter what anybody says, Nick Foles is not nearly as good. People forget that the Eagles defense gave up 20 points per game and they averaged just over 100 yards rushing until their bye in week nine last season. A lot of weight was on the shoulders of their young signal-caller, who I had as my MVP favorite until he got hurt versus the Rams. He was tremendous at producing big plays and keeping drives alive on third downs. The defense was pretty dominant throughout the playoffs at home and Nick Foles played the best football of his career, but they couldn‚Äôt do anything to stop Tom Brady until Brandon Graham‚Äôs strip-sack and I analyzed the brilliant offensive play-calling that made Foles‚Äô job a lot easier. However, in an opening game where the offense looked sloppy their ferocious D-line took over and they emerged victorious, buying Wentz some time to fully recover.      Pittsburgh Steelers ‚Äì The Le‚ÄôVeon Bell drama is in full swing I could talk about Big Ben‚Äôs ridiculous struggles on the road or T.J. Watt‚Äôs monster game of four sacks and the blocked field goal at the end of the game, but we all know what is on every Steelers‚Äô fans mind right now ‚Äì is Le‚ÄôVeon Bell worth the distractions? This is not Bell‚Äôs fault primarily since Pittsburgh has been the most-drama filled franchise in the NFL for a couple of years now. All the on-field antics, contract disputes and media news have felt like a reality show more so than a professional football team at times. Bell‚Äôs contract status has been discussed all offseason and he has yet to show at the team‚Äôs facility or sign his franchise tender. To me, he is the best all-around back in football, but the Steelers clearly don‚Äôt see him as part of their future at his price tag. James Conner‚Äôs outstanding performance of 192 scrimmage yards and two TDs certainly won‚Äôt quiet down the noise and at this point, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see Bell traded.     San Francisco 49ers ‚Äì Jimmy G is not invincible Everybody knew that Jimmy Garoppolo couldn‚Äôt stay undefeated forever, but with this statement I refer more to the fact that a good gameplan and the players to execute it can give the young signal-caller trouble. His completion-percentage of 45 percent and the fact he went three for eight on third downs are especially underwhelming when you consider some of the genius offensive scheming by Kyle Shanahan. Garoppolo‚Äôs job was made much easier being given easy dumpoffs off bootlegs, clever play-designs that included fake pick-plays and wide open crossing routes off misdirection. Of his three interceptions he overthrew one of his receivers, who fell down on a curl route, put a slant above the pads and he basically ended the game by trying to force the ball down the seam against triple-coverage. I still like him a lot going forward, which I described in my analysis of him once he signed his big contract, but this was a wakeup call.      Seattle Seahawks ‚Äì Germain Ifedi can not hang in there Von Miller had himself a day versus those Seahawks. He recorded three sacks, four hurries and two forced fumbles. The Broncos knew what they were doing however, because most of those numbers came rushing off the left end versus Germain Ifedi. Von had single-digit rushes against Duane Brown, who was holding his own, but he just killed the Hawks right tackle. One sack came off a stunt with the tight-end chipping him and his second fumble happened a couple of yards downfield when Miller simply took it away from Chris Carson. But Back to Ifedi ‚Äì I know it‚Äôs a very tough assignment because Von still is the premiere edge rusher in the NFL, but that was an embarrassing showing and it‚Äôs not like Sunday was the first time we‚Äôve seen that from Ifedi. He has been one of the worst starting offensive linemen in the league since he was drafted in 2015. He constantly overextended and leaned outside his frame, putting himself into horrible positions on Sunday.      Tennessee Titans ‚Äì This team could be in a lot of injury trouble There were a few things I came away with after the Titans week one game, like Marcus Mariota still staring down some of his receivers and not getting off his primary read or the defense being tricked easily on some plays, but with the bad luck they have had in terms of injuries, this was my main observation. In almost seven hours from the kickoff the Titans saw Marcus Mariota leave the game with a banged up elbow, Taylor Lewan entering concussion protocol after taking a cheap-shot and Delanie Walker being carted off the field with a dislocated ankle. Add to that the fact that Taylor Lewan is still recovering from a torn ACL and an offense that I thought could really shine under the lead of new offensive coordinator Matt LaFleur might be very limited at least for a certain period of time. Let‚Äôs hope they are healthy soon again.      Washington Redskins ‚Äì The O-line is nasty and AP could have another huge year I surprised some people when I said the Redskins had one of the top ten combinations of offensive and defensive line back in June. They were constantly reshuffling along both fronts last season, especially on the offensive side of the ball. However, when they are at 100 percent they are punishing people. I think Trent Williams is the best left tackle in football, Brandon Scherff is a Pro Bowl guard, Chase Roullier‚Äôs mobility at center gives them another dimension and they just work extremely well together. In the process, I think Adrian Peterson could have a major resurgence, because he will have running room and he moved like a 25-year old out there. Up 21-nothing at halftime, Washington pounded the ball on 42 rush attempts for 182 yards. Plus they ran a screen pass to AP that went for 52 yards and would have closed the game if there was no fumble.

Kevin White  Teams are looking for talented youngsters in the upcoming NFL draft. But on many occasions, what looks to be a certainty can underwhelm, with players not living up to their expectations.  A bust can haunt franchises for a surprisingly long time, especially when considering who they could have drafted instead. Wide receivers are always a tricky business in the draft, as skill positions receive a lot of scrutiny when taken early.        Here are the five biggest wide receiver busts in NFL draft history:           #5. Troy Edwards, Pittsburgh Steelers (#13 in 1999) Troy Edwards represented Louisiana Tech University in college football, where he established himself as one of the most productive receivers ever. He was named an All-American and took home the Fred Biletnikoff Award. Josh Yohe@JoshYohe_PGHSteelers ""needed"" a WR in 99. Took Troy Edwards. Reaching is never good.4832 In the 1999 draft, the Pittsburgh Steelers selected Edwards 13th overall. Before calling it a career in 2007 (as a member of the Grand Rapids Rampage of the Arena Football League), Edwards eventually played for six different NFL teams. Edwards accumulated 203 catches for 2,404 yards and 11 touchdowns overall.     #4. Peter Warrick, Cincinnati Bengals (#4 in 2000) If it weren\'t for his arrest on suspicion of stealing, Peter Warrick (one of the most exciting athletes in college football history) would have easily taken home the 1999 Heisman Award. The were warning signs when he performed the 40-yard dash much slower than expected before the 2000 NFL draft. Goodberry@JoeGoodberryBengals lose Isaac Curtis in 1985.They draft Eddie Brown in 1985.Bengals lose Eddie Brown in 1992.They draft Carl Pickens in 1992.Bengals lose Carl Pickens in 2000.They draft Peter Warrick in 2000.Bengals lose Chad Johnson in 2011.They draft AJ Green in 2011.28760 Warrick was unable to reproduce his college performance in the NFL. His best season while playing for the Cincinnati Bengals was in 2003, when he caught 79 passes for 819 yards and seven touchdowns. However, a knee injury in 2004 cost him 12 games and led to his 2005 retirement, a disappointing return for a fourth-overall pick.     #3. Kevin White, Chicago Bears (#7 in 2015) Chicago Bears v Minnesota Vikings West Virginia had a star player in Kevin White. He was the second wideout off the deck in 2015 after finishing his senior season with 1,447 receiving yards and ten scores. Injuries marred his first three years with the Chicago Bears, and after the 2018 campaign, the organization allowed him to leave. PointsBet Sportsbook@PointsBetUSAKevin White\'s 64 yard catch tonight was more yards than he had in his entire Bears career11035422     Since then, he has played for the New Orleans Saints, San Francisco 49ers, and the Arizona Cardinals. While multiple wideouts selected after him (like Tyler Lockett, DeVante Parker, and Stefon Diggs) have gone on to have excellent careers, White would only record 25 receptions in the NFL. #2. Justin Blackmon, Jacksonville Jaguars (#5 in 2012) Before being selected fifth overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2012 NFL draft, Justin Blackmon was a college player for Oklahoma State. There, he was a two-time consensus All-American. Field Yates@FieldYatesFrom 2012-2017, the Jaguars made SIX straight picks in the top 5: WR Justin Blackmon, OT Luke Joeckel, QB Blake Bortles, DE Dante Fowler, Jr., CB Jalen Ramsey and then RB Leonard Fournette. None of them last more than 5 seasons with the team. Major whiffs.70091171     Blackmon was so well-liked by the Jaguars that they moved up to acquire him. They had the seventh overall pick going into the 2012 draft, but following a deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, they were allotted the fifth pick. Despite having a solid rookie year in 2012, Blackmon\'s career was hampered by numerous suspensions.

Activision encourages players to play their battle-royale title more during the weekends and allows them to earn double XP to level up their characters and weapons in-game. While a good reward for those who are unable to log into the game on a daily basis, it would seem these weekends have caught Kyler Murray‚Äôs attention as well.

They are rewarded with double experience points, enabling them to upgrade their characters. Players refer to them as double XP weekends.

Coincidence? @Danny_Heifetz @DannyBKelly @noahmoreparties @pahowdy60848 In a similar analysis from a different user, they found that the quarterback's fantasy points per game were much more irregular. The relationship between the Call of Duty double XP weekends and Kyler Murray's performance is there for all to see.      What can we take from these Kyler Murray reports? NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Arizona Cardinals v Los Angeles Rams If these reports are to be taken seriously, it is no surprise that the Cardinals included a (now rescinded) clause in his new contract. The infamous homework clause compelled him to study game tape for four hours before every game without distraction. As to whether this is all just a coincidence is another matter. The quarterback's Call of Duty habits need to be analyzed before drawing any conclusions. Without confirming the hours Kyler Murray spends playing the game over double XP weekends, these reports don't hold up. Comparisons need to be drawn between the hours he plays on normal weekends with double XP weekends, to see if there is an increase in his gaming hours.     Regadless, Kyler Murray will doubtless be displeased with all the attention he is receiving. On the back of the homework clause debacle, he is no doubt wanting to get on with practice. Murray enters his fourth season in the league this campaign. He made the playoffs for the first time in his career last season. The game was a 34-11 Wild Card round loss to the Los Angeles Rams, which proved as disappointing as it was humbling.The Cardinals will be looking to improve on the 2021 campaign and make a deeper push into the playoffs. With regards to Kyler Murray's performances on double XP weekends, it will be interesting to see whether that correlation continues in the new season.     "", ""Should you trade Deandre Hopkins?  Arizona Cardinals wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins is currently one of the best at his position in the league. However, his fantasy value must have decreased due to his ongoing suspension from the NFL.  Competing in fantasy football might look easy, but you have to remain updated on the NFL players' status in the league. Fantasy football can be a bit frustrating if your players are not performing well or are missing games, which leads to lower fantasy points.        Is Hopkins present on your fantasy roster? Is it the right time to trade him? If you have similar questions in mind, then we are here to help.              Let's look at Hopkins' fantasy outlook for the 2022 season and then conclude whether he deserves to be on your fantasy roster or not. Should you trade DeAndre Hopkins? Hopkins is a potent offensive weapon. Due to the league's decision to suspend him, the Cardinals are now without their top wide receiver.     Two of the Cardinals' four regular-season games have ended in losses. Quarterback Kyler Murray depends on Marquise Brown to fill Hopkins' position now that he is absent. In May 2022, Hopkins was suspended from the league as he violated the league's performance-enhancing drugs (PED) policy. He tested positive for taking performance-enhancing substances, as traces of Ostarine were found in his reports. Hopkins will miss the first six games of the 2022 NFL season. He will return in Week 7 when the Cardinals face the New Orleans Saints on Thursday, October 20.        Last season, Hopkins played only ten games because of a torn MCL. This year, he will miss the first six games. In 2021, Hopkins had 42 receptions for 572 yards and eight touchdowns.If you have drafted DeAndre Hopkins in fantasy football, you should keep him as a backup option until his suspension ends. We are already entering the fifth week of the NFL, and will soon see DeAndre Hopkins join the Cardinals lineup in Week 7.     "", 'Kyler Murray bids final goodbye with DeAndre Hopkins released\xa0  There is almost never a dull day in the NFL, this week more so than most. It started with the Patriots being docked two OTAs and ended with WR DeAndre Hopkins being released from the Arizona Cardinals.   Hopkins, whose name was bandied around in umpteen trade proposals, is now free to sign with any team, with a number of contenders expected to vie for his signature.         Kyler Murray@K1Be great bro, thankful.@DeAndreHopkins7194409           According to multiple reports, Arizona tried to trade Hopkins leading up to the 2023 NFL Draft before ultimately considering his release. However, his injury record, age and massive contract proved to be hurdles for any potential trade move.  Hopkins is due $19.45 million this season and is set to make a reported $15.9 million in 2024, numbers that certainly don\'t scream a ""cap-friendly"" deal.  Following his release, QB Kyler Murray was quick to pen a few words on Twitter.  Murray said:      ""Be great bro, thankful,"" Murray tweeted. Hopkins had a roller-coaster tenure in Arizona. In 2020, he lit up the league, finishing the season with 115 catches for 1,407 yards and six touchdowns. However, it was all downhill from there.  Hopkins spent most of 2021 out injured. The next year, he missed the first six games of the season for ending up on the wrong side of the NFL‚Äôs performance-enhancing drug policy.

He was promptly asked to list the five quarterbacks he‚Äôd love to suit up next to in the NFL.  The five-time Pro Bowler\'s list had some surprises:  ""I will have to say one of my favorite quarterbacks that I\'ve been watching since he came in the league is Josh Allen. He reminds me of a new school Andrew Luck. I love Josh Allen. Jalen Hurts‚ÄîHouston kid. You\'re a dog, Jalen. Number three... Patrick Mahomes, obviously."" DHop added:  ""Number four, I gotta go with an underdog. Not a lot of people respect this guy as a throwing quarterback, Lamar Jackson, obviously."" For number five, the former Houston Texan was prompted to pick Dak Prescott, Hopkins instead said that he\'d heard great things about Houston\'s new quarterback C.J. Stroud, though his number five quarterback would have to be the ""dude in San Diego, with the Chargers,"" Justin Herbert.      Mina Kimes@minakimesTeams that should aggressively pursue D Hop:DetroitNew EnglandCarolinaDallasAtlantaIndy+ Buffalo, KC, NYG tho I think cap might be tricky2640178 ESPN\'s Mina Kimes listed six teams that should ideally pursue Hopkins. The Chiefs and Bills, two teams credited with a strong interest in the free-agent WR, were missing from the list.  Kansas City and Buffalo, however, appear to be unlikely unless DeAndre Hopkins takes a massive pay cut. The two teams have a shade above $1 million in cap space at the moment.  Philly, Baltimore and the Chargers do have some cap space to work with though - roughly $12 million.      As things stand, the New England Patriots appear to have the necessary prerequisites to work with when it comes to Hopkins.  Jeff Howe@jeffphoweThe Patriots, who previously checked in on DeAndre Hopkins, are more likely to pursue him now that the contract isn\'t as much of a hurdle, per sources. Financial competition is a factor, but there should be a level of interest from New England.994147The Patriots haven\'t had a 1,000-yard receiver on the roster since Julian Edelman lit up the league with Tom Brady in 2019. They technically have JuJu Smith-Schuster, who they signed in free agency after racking up 88 catches for 1,022 yards with the Chiefs last season, though DeAndre Hopkins would jolt the Patriots offense back into life.

The 2022 NFL season started with a renewed responsibility for the quarterback, as he was handed a bumper contract. So far this season, Murray has performed decently even though he hasn't replicated his 2021 form.

He has missed the Cardinals' last two games with a hamstring injury, which has seen backup quarterback Colt McCoy get into the lineup. Murray will likely miss the Cardinals' Week 12 matchup against the Los Angeles Chargers. However, when fit, Murray has no real competition as the No. 1 quarterback for the Cardinals.

A year later, and Murray is shining as the focal point of the Hawkeyes.  Last year\'s spotlight focused on Kris\' brother, Keegan Murray, who went on to be selected fourth in the 2022 NBA draft. Coming into this season, many wondered if Kris would be ready to take the next step forward in his development.        So far, that question has been answered emphatically.

', '5 takeaways from the Arizona Cardinals\' Week 6 win over the Dallas Cowboys | NFL 2020  In their first full game without franchise quarterback Dak Prescott, the Dallas Cowboys -- now led by former Cincinnati Bengals QB Andy Dalton -- suffered a 38-10 home defeat against the Arizona Cardinals on ""Monday Night Football"" to close out Week 6.  Led by native Texan QB Kyler Murray, who had never lost at AT&T Stadium in high school or college, the Cardinals just had too much on both sides of the ball for a depleted and shell-shocked looking Cowboys team.        Murray didn\'t have his best day throwing the football either, completing just over a third of his passes (9-of-24). For most QBs this would usually indicate a poor performance; not for Murray, though. The diminutive Cardinals\' star found receiver Christian Kirk for two touchdowns, rushed for 74 yards and a TD himself, and Murray didn\'t commit any turnovers.           The real star of the show for the Cardinals was running back Kenyan Drake, who finished with 164 rushing yards and two touchdowns. Drake started this season slow, but Monday\'s performance could be a positive sign of things to come. Without the league\'s most productive QB, the Cowboys struggled to convert on third downs all too often, and the late-fourth quarter ""garbage time"" touchdown pass from Dalton to receiver Amari Cooper did little to improve the spirits of Cowboys fans. The Cardinals were by far and away the better team, and everybody knew it by the time this one was over. Let\'s take a look at five takeaways from this NFC matchup.      5. Filling Dak Prescott\'s shoes is going to be just as impossible as expected for the Cowboys Arizona Cardinals v Dallas Cowboys It\'ll hardly be a surprise for anyone to read, but I have to mention that Andy Dalton struggled to fill Dak Prescott\'s boots on MNF. Give the guy credit where it is due: Dalton toughed it out in the pocket, throwing the ball often and getting hit often. He finished the game 34 of 54 for 266 yards through the air. At the very least, this game will have served as great practice for the man now tasked with taking the Cowboys to the playoffs.     Up against a talented, confident Cardinals defense, however, Dalton did throw two picks, and his one touchdown came when the game had already been decided. I don\'t wish to hang Dalton out to dry; it\'s just that anyone who watched the game could see that the Cowboys receivers missed Prescott\'s more dynamic and fearless approach. That\'s why one of the league\'s most exciting and productive offenses had to wait until the fourth quarter before getting into the end zone.  4. Cardinals\' opponents needs to game plan for Budda Baker Arizona Cardinals safety Budda Baker     The Cardinals had a great day on defense against the Cowboys. All facets flowed together: the pass rush was consistent; the coverage tight, the intensity noticeable from the start, and they finished the game with four turnovers. So it feels unfair to pick out just one player for praise, but can we all just take a moment to acknowledge that Budda Baker is one of the league\'s best safeties? Baker\'s uncanny ability to position himself in the thick of the action led him to finish with seven tackles, one tackle-for-loss, one sack and an interception. Any opponent of the Cardinals -- they play the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7 -- had better factor Baker\'s presence into their offensive schemes. His omnipresent style will be a problem for anyone, even league MVP front-runner Russell Wilson.  3. The Cowboys\' playmakers went missing Arizona Cardinals v Dallas Cowboys     Dalton wasn\'t the only reason the Cowboys\' offense struggled on Monday night. Big names were expected to stand up in the absence of Prescott and carry the mantle, but too many of them disappeared. Running back Ezekiel Elliot coughed the ball up twice in one game for the first time in his pro career. Wide receiver Micheal Gallup had a night to forget; he caught just two of six targets and dropped a dime of a pass from Dalton in the end zone.  2. The Cardinals\' running game is a legit threat Arizona Cardinals\' Kenyan Drake     Coming into this Week 6 clash, people were beginning to question the offensive production of Arizona running back Kenyan Drake. There was some belief that he was a goal-line threat but lacked the ability to consistently post up big numbers -- this coming after the Alabama product had failed to run for more than 100 yards in any of Arizona\'s first five games. Now Drake sits fourth in the NFL in rushing, and suddenly the Cardinals are a real threat on the ground. Funny what just one week can do. The Cowboys\' defense simply couldn\'t cope as they allowed Drake to help himself to two TDs and 164 yards on the ground (8.2 yards per carry). Cardinals\' fans will hope their top back is now able to consistently put these kinds of performances up against some of the league\'s far-sterner defenses.  1. The Cowboys\' defense is not very good     Arizona Cardinals v Dallas Cowboys Dallas linebacker Jaylon Smith played his heart out and finished the game with 10 solo tackles, so he\'s exempt from this critique. Take Smith out of this Cowboys\' defense, though, and I\'m afraid there\'s just not that much to like about this unit. It\'s not that they\'re terrible ... it\'s not even that they\'re bad\' ... they\'re just not very good. The Cowboys struggled to get ahold of Cardinals QB Kyler Murray, getting to him just once for a sack. The edge rushers and linebackers need to up the pass rush going forward.     Dallas was able to defend well as a unit for large parts of the night. They just didn\'t seem to have enough talent out there to come up with big plays on defense, not forcing any turnovers. The Cowboys\' inability to defend is ultimately what would have cost them a genuine chance at the Super Bowl this year even if Dak had stayed healthy.Can anyone tell me the last time a team conceding a league-high 36 points per game made a run at the championship?Perhaps this is something Jerry Jones will look to address during the offseason ... unless a flashy wide receiver becomes available, I mean.Also Read: What is Jerry Jones‚Äô Net Worth?

The Colts\' 26-11 loss to the Jaguars was one of the worst losses in franchise history. Although Wentz played a patricularly poor game, the entire team failed to perform adequately. Seeing Luck at Lucas Oil Stadium was likely hard for Colts fans. They were happy to see him looking healthy and happy. They couldn\'t help but wonder how things would\'ve turned out differently if the three-time Pro Bowler was still the quarterback, however.

During Luck\'s time at Standford, he was one of the most highly-touted college prospects in history. He received comparisons to the likes of Peyton Manning as a ""can\'t miss prospect.""Luck may have only played six seasons in the NFL, but he left a memorable impression on many during his time in the league. He holds a career record of 53-33, throwing 171 touchdowns and passing for 23,671 yards in just 86 appearances.     ', '""He\'s the best prospect"" - Former Stanford coach draws parallels between Andrew Luck, USC QB Caleb Williams\xa0  Caleb Williams is projected to be the first overall pick in 2024. The USC Trojans quarterback likely would have been a serious contender to Bryce Young for the first overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, if he were eligible.  With the NFL beckoning, the 21-year-old has been compared to several superstars of past and present. Former Stanford Cardinal head coach David Shaw too weighed in on the QB\'s prospects going forward.         Given his stellar performances heading up to the new season, Shaw was quick to compare the future star to a QB he coached in the past.      What did David Shaw say about Caleb Williams? David Shaw served as Andrew Luck\'s offensive coordinator and head coach during his collegiate career with the Stanford Cardinal. Speaking with Daniel Jeremiah and Bucky Brooks on the Move the Sticks podcast, Shaw stated: ""There\'s only one 10 out of 10 that I have seen. That\'s Andrew Luck. When Trevor Lawrence came out, I thought he was the best since Andrew. Caleb Williams is the best since Andrew. If he\'s not a 10, he\'s a 9.999999. His improvisational skills are to the level of Patrick Mahomes. You get mesmerized watching this guy play. Shaw went on to shower further praise on the USC QB comparing his intangibles to the former Colts star.     ""He\'s special. To me, it\'s Andrew one in this generation and Caleb Williams two. I don\'t know if there is a close number three. This guy is different. His accuracy, his athletic ability, his strength... This guy has got a natural make-or-miss ability and what I love most about him, that the great ones all have, he plays the game with a sense of calm. He knows he\'s better than you."" How does Caleb Williams\' college career compare to Andrew Luck\'s? Caleb Williams joined the Oklahoma Sooners as a five-star prospect in the 2021 recruiting class. He took over the starting role midway through his true freshman season.  Williams made 11 appearances, seven of which he started. He threw for 1,912 yards, 21 touchdowns and four interceptions. Through that stretch, he completed 64.5% of his passes while adding 442 rushing yards and six touchdowns to his name.      Caleb Williams\' performances earned him a spot on the second-team All-Big 12. Williams, though, decided to move on and join the USC Trojans via the transfer portal the following season.  During his first year with the Trojans, he completed 4,537 passing yards, 42 touchdowns and just five interceptions. Williams completed 66.6% of his passes while running for 382 yards and 10 touchdowns on 113 carries.  He was named the Heisman, while also being named a unanimous All-American, Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year and first-team All-Pac 12. Andrew Luck too was a five-star prospect coming out of high school in 2008. The QB joined the Stanford Cardinal and after redshirting his true freshman season, Luck took over the starting role in 2009.  He threw for 2,575 yards, 13 touchdowns and four interceptions in 12 games. Luck completed 56.3% of his passes while adding 354 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 61 carries. He followed that up with 3,338 passing yards, 32 touchdowns and eight interceptions the following season. Luck completed 70.7% of his passes while running for 453 yards and three touchdowns on 55 carries.      Former Indianapolis Colts QB Andrew Luck He was named the Heisman runner-up while also being named a first-team All-American, Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year and first-team All-Pac 12. Luck had another impressive season in 2011, throwing for 3517 yards, 37 touchdowns and ten interceptions. He completed 71.3% of his passes while adding 150 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 47 carries. He was once again named the Heisman runner-up, a first-team All-American, Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year and first-team All-Pac 12. In 2012, Luck got the chance to live out his NFL dreams after being selected first overall by the Indianapolis Colts.     ', ""Top 5 NFL QBs over 30 heading into 2022 season  The NFL is a young man's game. The wear and tear on a football player's body not only stops them from playing at a sustained high level, year in and year out, but can shorten careers just as quickly.   Over the past several years, the NFL has a seen some of its most significant quarterbacks retire due to performance (Drew Brees) and injuries (Andrew Luck). The most important position on the football field is also one that can end just as quickly as it began.        PFF@PFFRyan Fitzpatrick is retiring from the NFL after 17 seasons What a career 396063344           Heading into the 2022 season, the quarterback position has never been this loaded with talent under 30. Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have established a budding rivalry for AFC dominance. At the same time, Justin Herbert, Kyler Murray, and Lamar Jackson continue to demonstrate their multi-level skills on a week-by-week basis, making their teams perennial contenders for the Super Bowl. However, the old guard of the NFL quarterback class is still alive and ready to lead their teams to one more shot at glory. These veteran signal callers have had plenty of accomplishments but heading into the 2022 season, they will be looked upon to not just be a part of a team's success, but to be the catalyst for that.     Here are the top five NFL quarterbacks over 30 heading into the 2022 NFL season.  #5 - Matt Ryan, 37 years old - Indianapolis Colts New York Jets v Atlanta Falcons Matt Ryan started over 200 NFL games, all for the Atlanta Falcons, winning an NFL MVP in 2016 - the same year he led the Falcons to the Super Bowl. While Ryan has never won the big game, he is perhaps in his best position since the 2016 season, now as the starter for the Indianapolis Colts.      The Colts have been looking for a quarterback since Andrew Luck's early retirement, and Ryan is the best of that bunch. Heading into the 2022 season, Ryan will surely pass for over 60,000 yards passing and has a chance to reach 400 career touchdown passes.  #4 - Russell Wilson, 33 years old - Denver Broncos Denver Broncos Introduce Quarterback Russell Wilson Russell Wilson will be heading to Denver this year not just in an attempt to make the Broncos into a serious contender for the Super Bowl, but also to prove that he can win by playing the game the way he wants to play.      Much has been made of his former head coach Pete Carroll wanting to play tough defense and run the ball, over handing the keys to Wilson. This season, Wilson will be given the keys and everything else he needs to get the Broncos out of quarterback purgatory and to challenge in the very tough AFC West.  #3 - Matthew Stafford, 34 years old - Los Angeles Rams Super Bowl LVI - Los Angeles Rams v Cincinnati Bengals Matthew Stafford silenced his doubters, leading the Los Angeles Rams to the Super Bowl last season. In doing so, Stafford proved himself to be not just a gun-slinger-type quarterback who couldn't win.      He also showed himself as one of the best leaders and quarterbacks in the NFL. His connection with Super Bowl MVP Cooper Kupp was something defenses could not figure out, and he helped revitalize the career of Odell Beckham Jr.  Heading into the 2023 season, Stafford will be looking to do the same with former Chicago Bear, Allen Robinson, in an attempt to win another wide-open NFC.

At 38 years old, Aaron Rodgers looks completely comfortable behind the line of scrimmage and his relationship with head coach Matt LaFluer seems to be on solid ground.  Rodgers and the Packers have always looked like contenders to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl and the quarterback has put up fantastic numbers, aging like fine wine.  In the past three seasons, Rodgers has thrown for over 4000 yards each year, with 110 total touchdowns and only 11 total interceptions. While the Packers and Rodgers are missing that elusive second ring, they enter the 2023 season as NFC North favorites.      #1 - Tom Brady, 44 years old - Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl LV The greatest quarterback of all time decided that he wasn't ready to hang up his cleats just yet and is returning for the the 2023 season. The Buccaneers have surrounded Brady with the talent he needs to lead the team to another championship.  Brady stands at the top of almost every NFL record there is for a quarterback, but his most impressive feats have been his playoff performances. With seven NFL championships and 10 visits to the Super Bowl, Brady remains one of the all-time best playoff performers in any sport.      Whether it's his lifestyle or situation, no other athlete has been able to play at this high a level at this advanced an age. If you were to create a list of the best NFL players over 40 heading into the 2023 season, there would only be one name on that list.       "", ""NFL Divisional Round Picks\xa0  With the second weekend of January upcoming, it also means that it's time for the divisional weekend of the NFL playoffs. Hopefully, this weekend's games will have as many upsets, close games, and double drinkers as there was during last weekend's wild-card games.  However, the road teams may have a harder time pulling off some upsets this weekend against the dominant top seeds in both conferences. Here's what I think will happen in the divisional round.        SATURDAY           Colts vs. Chiefs, 4:35 p.m., NBC  Both the Colts and the Chiefs will be heading into Saturday's game with potent offences, led by quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Patrick Mahomes, respectively. The Colts also are coming off a strong defensive performance in their convincing wild-card win over Texans. The Chiefs, however, have a more explosive offense than the Texans, and that should be too much for the Indy defense. Chiefs 35-13.  Cowboys vs. Rams, 8:15 p.m., FOX  The second game on Saturday will feature two of the hottest teams in the NFC heading into the postseason. In my eyes, this game has the best chance for an upset this weekend, as both of these teams are pretty even on paper. In the end, Jared Goff, Sean McVay, and the innovative Rams offense will be the difference in this divisional matchup. Rams 28-25.  SUNDAY  Chargers at Patriots, 1:05 p.m., CBS  The Los Angeles Chargers aren't your typical five-seed, having barely missed out on a first-round bye. The New England Patriots aren't your typical Pats team, as questions about Tom Brady's playing ability and age have lingered all year and their defense has struggled all year, with the focus being the league-worst pass rush.     However, there are no questions about Brady's postseason success, and his success and playmaking ability should earn the Pats to yet another AFC championship game. Patriots 30-10.  Eagles at Saints, 4:40 p.m., FOX  For the second straight postseason, the Eagles will be trying to make the Super Bowl with their backup quarterback, Nick Foles. It went pretty well last year, and it's off to a good start this year, with the help of the field goal uprights at Solider Field. However, this week, Philly will be facing an offensive juggernaut in New Orleans, led by quarterback Drew Brees, a 40-something quarterback playing like he is in his twenties. Though the Eagles have been a pretty good underdog story this year, their season will come to an end at the hands of the Saints, who are playing like the Super Bowl favorites that Vegas thinks they are. Saints 40-24.      "", 'Is Heisman Trophy-winning USC QB Caleb Williams overrated? A contrarian look to national viewpoint on Trojans signal caller  Caleb Williams is the consensus favorite to win the Heisman Trophy for the second consecutive year. Former Ohio State Buckeyes running back Archie Griffin remains the only player to win the prestigious award multiple times.  Williams has received plenty of hype since making his collegiate debut in the 2021 season. The USC Trojans quarterback is considered the top prospect in the 2024 NFL Draft and has been labeled the best quarterback prospect since Andrew Luck.         Take a look at whether or not Williams is deserving of such praise:       How has Caleb Williams performed in his college career? Caleb Williams joined the Oklahoma Sooners as a five-star prospect in the 2021 recruiting class. He took as the starting quarterback midway through his true freshman season, making 11 appearances and seven starts. He ended the season with 1,912 passing yards, 21 touchdowns and four interceptions. Williams completed 64.5% of his passes while adding 442 rushing yards and six touchdowns. His performances earned him a spot on the second team All-Big 12. Following the season, Williams followed coach Lincoln Riley and joined the USC Trojans via the transfer portal. As a sophomore, he threw for 4,537 yards, 42 touchdowns and just five interceptions. Williams completed 66.6% of his passes while running for 382 yards and 10 touchdowns on 113 carries. He won the Heisman Trophy and was also named a unanimous All-American, Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year and first-team All-Pac 12.      Is Caleb Williams deserving of the hype he has received? Caleb Williams has received plenty of praise, drawing comparisons to Andrew Luck and Patrick Mahomes. While those are lofty expectations to place on any college player, Williams has shown that he has the talent to warrant them. While speaking with Daniel Jeremiah and Bucky Brooks on the Move the Sticks podcast, Luck\'s former college coach David Shaw compared the two prospects: ""He\'s special. To me, it\'s Andrew one in this generation and Caleb Williams two. I don\'t know if there is a close number three. This guy is different. His accuracy, his athletic ability, his strength...  ""This guy has got a natural make-or-miss ability and what I love most about him, that the great ones all have, he plays the game with a sense of calm. He knows he\'s better than you.""While he will need to prove his talent at the next level, both his stats and eye test check out when evaluating Williams. Don\'t be surprised if he becomes the latest quarterback to turn an NFL franchise around.     ', ""NFL 2018: Top 12 0.5 PPR NFL Fantasy Wide Receivers  Wide Receivers are vital in PPR leagues for obvious reasons. Their catching! If you didn't know, PPR stands for 'Point per Reception'. Here I take a look at my top 12 ranked receivers for the coming season.          #12. TY Hilton - Indianapolis Colts - 2017 total = 147.1           Houston Texans v Indianapolis Colts Now this pick could easily change, the closer we get to the NFL season. It all depends on Andrew Lucks' health and if he will be ready to play football at the beginning of the season. Last season, was a down season for Hilton. His 966 receiving yards were the fewest he's had in a season since his rookie year, and way down on the previous seasons total of 1448 yards, which led the league.     Hilton only caught 57 passes, which ranked at 36th among all WR's. That's not exactly the type of productivity you are expecting from the usually reliable Hilton. This was mainly due to Hilton's rapport with Jacoby Brissett being nowhere near as good as when he's paired with Luck. When he last played with Luck in the 2016 season he set a career high in receiving yards and receptions. I fully expect him to set those sorts of figures again if Andrew Luck returns. #11 Adam Thielen ‚Äì Minnesota Viking‚Äôs ‚Äì 2017 total = 194.2 Baltimore Ravens v Minnesota Vikings     2017 was a breakout year for Thielen, setting career highs in receiving yards and receptions. He overtook Stefon Diggs as the ‚Äògo to‚Äô receiver on the team and showed great rapport with Case Keenum. He caught 91 passes, for 1276 yards and 4 touchdowns as Keenum played the best football of his career. This year, it‚Äôs Kirk Cousins at the helm, which is an instant upgrade for the Minnesota offense. Will he have the same rapport with Thielen as Keenum did? I think he will. He‚Äôs a franchise Quarterback who can get it done week in week out. It will be interesting to see how long it takes that connection to flourish. #10 Michael Thomas ‚Äì New Orleans Saints ‚Äì 2017 total = 203.5 New Orleans Saints v Carolina Panthers     Thomas quietly had a very strong 2017 season. In his sophomore year, he caught 104 passes, which was the third most in the league. It was a productive season for the wideout, despite the Saints going with a run-heavy approach to help relieve some pressure on the aging Drew Brees. That being said, the Saints re-signed Brees on a 2-year deal this offseason, showing their confidence in him to take them to a Super Bowl. Thomas is the undoubted WR1 in the offense, and he will continue to receive high volume whenever Brees looks down the field. #9 Mike Evans ‚Äì Tampa Bay Buccaneers ‚Äì 2017 total = 167. Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Carolina Panthers     Evans has all the talent in the world to be an elite receiver in this league for many years. He was a part of the famous WR group in the 2014 draft, where he was drafted with the 7th overall pick, ahead of Odell Beckham Jr. However, 2017 marked career lows for Evans in receptions and yards. This was largely down to his QB, Jameis Winston, not progressing like everyone had expected. That being said, Evans is always Winston‚Äôs first look, so hopefully, he can get back to his 2016 season form, where he caught 96 passes for 1321 yards and 12 touchdowns. #8 AJ Green ‚Äì Cincinnati Bengals ‚Äì 2017 total = 189.3 Cleveland Browns v Cincinnati Bengals     AJ Green truly is one of the best receivers in the NFL. He has put up 1000+ yard seasons in 6 out of the 7 years he has been in the league. That includes 2017, where he caught 75 passes for 1078 yards and 8 touchdowns, despite being on a poor Bengals team with some lackluster performances from Andy Dalton. The offense should be helped by the return of a healthy Tyler Eifert at Tight End and 2017 draft sensation, John Ross, getting more playing time. I see this creating more space for Green as he will face less double teams from opposing CBs. I project him having over 85 catches this coming season. #7 Larry Fitzgerald ‚Äì Arizona Cardinals ‚Äì 2017 total = 206.9 Tennessee Titans v Arizona Cardinals     The aging legend, Larry Fitzgerald, had yet another stellar season for the Arizona Cardinals. He has been such a valuable weapon for Carson Palmer over the years, and maybe none more so than this past season. Fitz caught a massive 109 passes, which was second most in the league, with only Jarvis Landry catching more. Amazingly, Jaron Brown, who had the second most receptions at WR, was miles behind with just 31 catches on the year. This shows that despite being 34 years of age, Fitzgerald is still the main cog in the Cardinals passing game. This new season will see a change of Quarterback in Arizona, with Sam Bradford being signed as a free agent, and Josh Rosen being acquired in the draft with the number 10 overall pick. Whoever is under center come game week 1, Fitzgerald with seeing his usual high volume, as he chases down Terrell Owens for number 2 on the all-time list for receiving yards.     #6 Davante Adams ‚Äì Green Bay Packers ‚Äì 2017 total = 185.5 Green Bay Packers v Carolina Panthers Adams has been fantastic for the Packers over this past couple of seasons, and this year he gets the chance to be the undoubted WR1 in the Green Bay offense. With Jordy Nelson leaving for Oakland Raiders and no veteran brought in to replace him, there will be a lot more targets up for grabs. Adams showed last year that he could get the job done even when Aaron Rodgers went down with a broken collarbone.     This year, Rodgers will be back to full health and is likely to hyper-target Adams, especially in the red zone. He has 22 touchdowns over the past two seasons, which is more than all of the players who have ranked ahead of him on this list. I see a big season ahead for the 25-year-old, former second-round pick out of Fresno State. #5 Keenan Allen ‚Äì Los Angeles Chargers ‚Äì 2017 total = 234.2 San Diego Chargers v Kansas City Chiefs Allen had a slow start to the 2017 season, but he ended up tallying the most receptions and receiving yards of his career. He showed that when he can stay healthy, he is easily a WR1 in this league. Coming off a lacerated kidney in 2015, and a torn ACL in 2016, Allen had become known as injury prone, and many had their doubts about him coming into the 2017 season.     The Chargers even drafted Mike Williams with the 7th overall pick to bolster their WR corps. Allen showed all those doubters wrong as he caught 102 passes and racked up 1393 receiving yards. I fully expect more of the same this year, as the Chargers look to be serious contenders to go far in the playoffs. #4 Julio Jones ‚Äì Atlanta Falcons ‚Äì 2017 total = 207.9 NFC Championship - Green Bay Packers v Atlanta Falcons Julio Jones is a freak athlete, with size, strength and great hands. However, last year seemed to be a bit of a disappointment for fantasy owners who had drafted him in the first round. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Jones still caught 88 passes for 1444 yards, so it was far from a poor season. His main issue was in the touchdown column.     He only caught 3 passes in the end zone, compared to totals of 8 and 10 in years gone by. This was mainly down to Matt Ryan‚Äôs inaccuracy in the RedZone. I see him improving on last years totals, with the addition of Calvin Ridley really helping. Ridley will take some of the attention away from Julio, freeing him up for more receptions and more touchdowns. #3 DeAndre Hopkins ‚Äì Houston Texans ‚Äì 2017 total = 261.8 Houston Texans v Tennessee Titans Hopkins had a fantastic 2017 season for the Texans, catching 13 touchdowns in 15 games, leading to First-team All-Pro honors. He had double-digit targets in the majority of games, regardless of the coverage assigned to him. He showed he could produce big numbers no matter who the team had at Quarterback.     Hopkins also struck up a great rapport with rookie QB Deshaun Watson before he got injured. This will give Texans fans and fantasy owners great hope going into the 2018 season. If Watson can get back to the superb form he displayed in his rookie year, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Hopkins ends up as the WR1 at the end of the season. #2 Odell Beckham Jr ‚Äì New York Giants ‚Äì 2017 total = 61.5 Dallas Cowboys v New York Giants 2017 was a bit of a write off for OBJ, as he missed the first game with an ankle injury and then suffered a fractured ankle in the week 5 match against the Chargers. In those 3 and a half games, he managed 25 catches for 302 yards and 3 touchdowns, which is a great return.     This offseason has been dominated by bad press, trade rumors, and talk of Beckham Jr wanting to be the highest paid player in the NFL. The Giants would be crazy to trade Odell away as he is on course to be one of the best receivers the league has ever seen. In his 47 career games, Beckham has 38 touchdowns and 4424 receiving yards to his name. If he carries on at that pace he will surpass some of the all-time greats and break numerous records. This season will be an interesting one for the Giants offense. The acquisition of Saquon Barkley will relieve the pressure on Eli Manning and is likely to free up more space for the receivers to take full advantage. I see another huge season for Odell, as long as he can stay out of trouble. #1 Antonio Brown ‚Äì Pittsburgh Steelers ‚Äì 2017 total = 259.8 Indianapolis Colts v Pittsburgh Steelers     What a season it was for the Antonio Brown, as he cemented his place as the best wide receiver in the league. Brown caught 101 passes for a league-leading 1533 yards, and 9 touchdowns. He is so crucial to the Steelers offense, getting separation from defender‚Äôs time and time again. Given his relatively diminutive size, Brown has proved that you don‚Äôt need to be over 6 feet tall to be a success in the NFL. He has made every team that passed on him in the 2010 Draft pay, as he continues to put up big numbers year after year. The former 6th round and 195th overall pick will be a top 6-7 pick in all Fantasy drafts this coming year.

However, for one reason or another, things don\'t always work out for them.  This can be due to a number of things - playing for a terrible franchise, injuries, or the player lacking the mental toughness and discipline to last in the NFL.        Many players have shown flashes of their talent before fading away. Here are five examples of players not living up to their true potential.            #5 - Aldon Smith Aldon Smith in action Aldon Smith was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers seventh-overall in the 2011 NFL Draft, and showed promise right away. During his rookie season, he recorded 14 sacks. Just a year later, he bettered that tally by racking up 19.5 quarterback takedowns, which is a 49ers franchise record that still stands today. His 33.5 sacks also remain the most by any player in their first two NFL seasons.     Unfortunately, Smith\'s off-field issues soon took over his career. He was first arrested in 2012 on a DUI charge. After being arrested three times for the same offense, the 49ers released Smith in August 2015. He was given a second chance in the league when the Oakland Raiders picked him up. However, after becoming embroiled in a domestic violence case, the Raiders released him in March 2018. He did return to the league in 2020, playing for the Dallas Cowboys after a two-year hiatus. In 16 starts, he recorded only five sacks. It was clear that his off-field antics had cost him his best years in the NFL. At the time of writing, he\'s a free agent. He was also arrested again for a DUI, in December 2021. Ari Meirov@MySportsUpdate#Seahawks DE Aldon Smith turned himself in Tuesday night on a second-degree battery charge and was released after posting $25,000 bond. A next court date has not yet been set.4:36 PM ¬∑ Apr 21, 20211132113      #4 - Carson Wentz Carson Wentz There is an argument to be made that Carson Wentz hasn\'t been in the league long enough to be on this list. But the potential he showed in his early days with the Philadelphia Eagles is such a contrast with some of his play with the Indianapolis Colts in 2021 that he makes this five. In just his second year in the NFL, in 2017, Wentz was performing at an MVP-level rate. He would most likely have picked up the award too, had he not gone down with a season-ending ACL tear. The Eagles did win the Super Bowl that year, but on his return to the NFL, Wentz would never be the same quarterback.     He was listed third overall in the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018, but he would only start 11 games that year, going 5-6 in them. Wentz\'s inaccuracy as a thrower became his main problem, along with the injury record. In 2020, he threw 15 interceptions and just 16 touchdowns before Philadelphia traded him to the Indianapolis Colts. Wentz would be solid in Indy, passing for 27 touchdowns, but he couldn\'t lead the Colts to the playoffs in 2021. So, they shipped him off to the Washington Commanders. There is a chance Wentz will have a bounce-back year now that he\'s back in the NFC East. But his recent performances leave a lot to be desired, against his fantastic 2017 season.   #3 - Josh Gordon Josh Gordon first made a mark after being drafted in by the Browns     Josh Gordon burst onto the NFL scene after being drafted by the Cleveland Browns in 2012. Gordon\'s rookie season of 805 receiving yards was followed up by a 2013 season where he led the league in receiving yards, going for 1,646 yards and nine touchdowns.  His quarterback that year was Brandon Weeden, which made his feat even more impressive. But this was as good as it got for Gordon. In July 2014, he was arrested for driving while impaired. Then a month later, the NFL suspended him for one year for violating their substance-abuse policy. This suspension would be reduced, but he would only play five games in 2014. He would miss the entire 2015 and 2016 seasons as he was dealing with another NFL substance-abuse suspension. Gordon would also check himself into rehab during this time, but it was clear his days in the league were numbered. The Browns traded Gordon to the New England Patriots in 2017. There, he won a Super Bowl ring, despite walking away from football earlier in the year, to focus on his mental health.     Gordon has since spent time with the Seattle Seahawks and Kansas City Chiefs. But he has never lived up to the potential he displayed in his early days with the Browns.  #2 - Cam Newton Cam Newton Cam Newton was drafted first-overall by the Carolina Panthers in the 2011 NFL draft, and straight away showed the league he was worthy of that selection.  Newton set an NFL record of 14 rushing touchdowns for a quarterback as a rookie in 2011, on his way to NFL Rookie of the Year honors.      He would make three Pro Bowls, as well as being named league MVP in 2015, as Newton lead the Panthers all the way to Super Bowl 50. There, they were defeated by Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos. Since then, however, Newton hasn\'t lived up to his potential at all. His powerful running style for a quarterback has seen him take many hits, which have lead to a number of injuries, and he hasn\'t been the same player since his MVP season.  Newton spent time with the New England Patriots in 2020, before returning to Carolina in 2021. But it was clear that he isn\'t the same player, going 0-5 in his five starts for the team last year.  #1 - Andrew Luck Andrew Luck in action     Coming out of Stanford, many NFL fans and analysts saw Andrew Luck as the best quarterback prospect since Peyton Manning and John Elway. After being taken first-overall in the 2012 NFL Draft by the Indianapolis Colts, Luck displayed his potential from the off. He set the rookie record for passing yards, and was a four-time Pro Bowler. But Luck announced his retirement in a shock move, at the age of just 29 in 2019.  He cited his injuries as the main reason for retiring, as he was sacked 174 times in just 86 games throughout his career. The Colts did a terrible job protecting Luck. Having missed the entire 2017 season through injury, before winning NFL Comeback Player of the Year in 2018, Luck felt it was the right time to walk away. ""I\'ve been stuck in this process. I haven\'t been able to live the life I want to live. It\'s taken the joy out of this game. The only way forward for me is to remove myself from football. This is not an easy decision. It\'s the hardest decision of my life. But it is the right decision for me.""     It was clear Luck was on the path to becoming a Pro Football Hall of Famer, having passed for 171 touchdowns, which included him leading the league with 40 in 2014. According to The Ringer, Luck was hit or sacked 352 times throughout his career, which is way too many hits for your franchise quarterback to be taking.

A franchise like the Colts, who‚Äôve won three NFL championships and two Super Bowls, are bound to have a rich history of talented players.  Current University of Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh served as the Colts‚Äô quarterback for a few seasons during the 90s. The Pro Bowler is known for leading the team to the 1995 AFC Championship Game, where they fell to the Pittsburgh Steelers.        While Harbaugh achieved success during his time in Indy, he isn‚Äôt one of the three greatest quarterbacks in Colts history. So who are the franchise‚Äôs top-three qb‚Äôs of all time?           Ranking the 3 greatest quarterbacks in Indianapolis Colts history - #3 Andrew Luck With Peyton Manning missing the entire season due to injury, the Colts suffered a miserable 2011 campaign, going 2-14. The team wound up with the top pick in the 2012 NFL draft, which they used to select Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck. The Colts released Manning, who later signed with the Denver Broncos, and opted to build around the younger Luck. Most fans were sad to see Manning leave town, but Luck would quickly help ease that pain with some magnificent performances. The Houston, Texas native had a remarkable rookie year, leading the Colts to 11 wins and a trip to the postseason. Luck emerged as a star in Indianapolis, becoming a 4-time Pro Bowler and easily one of the league‚Äôs best signal callers. It looked like it was guaranteed that he‚Äôd eventually make the Football Hall of Fame. However, due to the Colts failing to assemble a quality offensive line to protect him, Luck ended up battling perennial injuries.     He finished his career having played only six NFL seasons, shocking the world when he announced his retirement in 2019. He‚Äôs now one of the biggest ‚Äúwhat-if?‚Äù stories in sports history. SportsCenter@SportsCenterBreaking: Andrew Luck has informed the Colts he is retiring from the NFL, a league source tells @AdamSchefter.There will be a press conference Sunday to make it official, but Luck is mentally worn down, and now checking out.9:32 AM ¬∑ Aug 24, 2019204748283 - #2 Johnny Unitas A close up of the late Hall of Fame Quarterback Johnny Unitas, formerly of the Baltimore Colts,     Hopefully, you weren't expecting Curtis Painter or Carson Wentz next. If you were then you will be sorely disappointed (as neither man has made this list). At No.2 we go to a Colt who starred when the franchise was in Baltimore. Johnny Unitas is widely considered one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever set foot on a football field. He played with the Colts from 1956 to 1972, leading the club to three NFL championships and a Super Bowl victory. As a Colt, Unitas won three MVP awards, made 10 Pro Bowls and led the NFL in passing touchdowns four years in a row. The Hall of Famer set the record for most consecutive contests with a touchdown pass at 47. It would take 52 years for his record to be broken (by Drew Bress in 2012 with 54). - #1 Peyton Manning Back in 1998, the Colts, who owned the first overall pick in the draft, had a tough decision to make. Which quarterback should they select: Tennessee‚Äôs Peyton Manning or Washington State‚Äôs Ryan Leaf?     However, as the story goes, the team obviously went with Manning in what proved to be one of the best decisions in franchise history. Unfortunately, Leaf would go on to become one of the biggest NFL busts of all time. NFL@NFLIndianapolis @Colts unveil Peyton Manning statue with ceremony: on.nfl.com/gHtVDa #ThankYouPeyton5:33 AM ¬∑ Oct 7, 20171038261 Manning spent 14 seasons as Indy‚Äôs star quarterback, leading the team to two Super Bowls, winning one of them. He also took home four regular-season MVPs and a Super Bowl MVP during his time in the Hoosier State.Despite playing his last four seasons with the Broncos, Manning will always be better known for his tenure as a Colt. He is perhaps the greatest NFL quarterback of all time, not named Joe Montana or Tom Brady.     "", 'Ranking the 10 biggest QB busts in the NFL Draft  The NFL Draft is quite a magnificent event, with NFL teams looking to secure their future by selecting the best prospects out of collegiate football on an annual basis.  Scouts work into the late hours of the night for months in advance to ensure every angle on a player is covered, yet scouts can only provide so much information.         Some players also have hidden characteristics that are hugely damaging. These aren‚Äôt visible until after a player has been selected in the NFL Draft and paid an awful lot of money.           No position is more expensive than quarterback, and given the desperation to find a good one, there is no position with more NFL Draft busts. This pressure permeates the locker room and pushes players to make mistakes and make poor choices and is something we‚Äôve seen through the years of the NFL Draft. Here we look at the 10 biggest busts from the draft at quarterback:  Who are the top 10 biggest NFL Draft busts at quarterback? #10 Robert Griffin III (2012 NFL Draft, Round 1 Pick 2) Despite his NFL failures, few have negative words to say about RGIII     Labeling Robert Griffin III an NFL Draft bust is perhaps a little harsh. He had an outstanding rookie season in which he led Washington to the playoffs, before injuries ruined his career. Unlike other names we will revisit later in this list, Griffin‚Äôs commitment to football can‚Äôt be questioned. He has worked incredibly hard to forge a career for himself as a backup in Cleveland and Baltimore. However, for a player that was taken directly after Andrew Luck, Griffin has simply not produced. In 2012 and 2013, Griffin threw for 3,200 and 3,203 yards respectively, missing just two games across both seasons. However, in the subsequent six seasons, he has mustered just 14 starts. RGIII was on the way to having an excellent NFL career before his knee injuries ruined his progress. His numbers with Washington were very strong, throwing for 36 touchdowns across his first two seasons. However, we also need to consider how much Washington gave up to move up to #2 in the NFL Draft to select him. They effectively ruined their draft strategy for years to come and that makes it difficult to view this pick as anything other than a bust, even if Griffin retains respect in the league.      #9 Tim Couch (1999 NFL Draft, Round 1 Pick 1) Tim Couch\'s body just wouldn\'t allow him to succeed in the NFL Injuries are the cause of Tim Couch being labeled an NFL Draft bust. The league never fully saw a healthy version of the Kentucky quarterback who dominated the collegiate game. Bruce Arians remains one of Couch‚Äôs biggest supporters, criticizing anyone who labels the former Cleveland Browns QB as a bust. His shoulder and arm ligaments had been so badly damaged over his college career that he was never healthy in the NFL. He was always playing and practicing in pain.     Couch had undeniable ability; he wouldn‚Äôt have been selected first-overall in the 1999 NFL Draft otherwise. Yet, he managed to throw for just 11,131 yards in five years with the Browns, though he notably led them to the playoffs in 2002. The expectation that comes with him being drafted #1 is something that Couch‚Äôs body would never allow him to deliver on. While it is unfortunate to look back on, he remains one of the NFL Draft‚Äôs bigger busts.  #8 David Carr (2002 NFL Draft, Round 1 Pick 1) David Carr walked into a difficult situation with an expansion franchise     David Carr was thrown in at the deep end when he was selected as the first-ever Houston Texan shortly after they entered the league as an expansion franchise. His NFL career was average rather than abjectly poor, but this doesn‚Äôt cut the mustard when you‚Äôre selected as the premier player in your NFL Draft class. A historically poor offensive line in Houston saw Carr sacked 249 times over the course of five seasons. His inability to escape pressure reflects badly on him while his slow-release time was a huge limitation to his progress in the NFL.  Having never been challenged in college football, the intensity of NFL defenses panicked Carr and he was never able to adjust. You can‚Äôt blame a player for where they were selected in the NFL Draft, but for the Texans organization, David Carr was a huge disappointment.  #7 Jake Locker (2011 NFL Draft, Round 1 Pick 8)     It took Jake Locker just four NFL seasons to fall out of love with the sport Anticipation for Jake Locker being in the NFL built for a period of over two years. He would have been a top prospect had he declared for the 2010 NFL Draft, yet Locker elected to remain at the University of Washington for a further year. This allowed him another year of play in the NCAA Division 1, even though some analysts had him as the #1 pick in 2010. His senior performances were indicative of a drop in standards and focus. By the time the 2011 NFL Draft arrived, Locker had dropped to a grade outside the top-10.     SportsPac12@SportsPac12With the NFL Combine starting this week, we\'ve compiled all Pac-12 performances since 2000Top QB 40-Yard Dash Times4.51‚ÄîJake Locker, UW, 20114.52‚ÄîMarcus Mariota, Oregon, 20154.58‚ÄîDennis Dixon, Oregon, 20084.59‚ÄîAndrew Luck, Stanford, 2012All 947:sportspac12.com/historical-pac‚Ä¶157 By this time, Cam Newton had overtaken him as the elite QB prospect in the class, and the Tennessee Titans felt they had got a bargain by selecting Locker at #8. A year as a backup to a veteran is no bad thing for a rookie quarterback, and when Matt Hasselbeck went down in late 2011, Locker threw for four touchdowns and scored a rushing TD. It seemed as though he was ready to take the starting job in Tennessee for the 2012 season, but it simply went downhill from there.      A physical battering in a defeat to the New England Patriots really knocked his confidence. After 11 starts in which he threw for more interceptions than touchdowns, a shoulder injury ended Locker‚Äôs season, and his time as a starter with the Titans. He started just seven games in 2013 and five in 2014, throwing just 13 total further touchdown passes. The interceptions didn‚Äôt disappear, and in the blink of an eye, his NFL career was over. The Titans didn‚Äôt pick up his fifth-year option and he quickly retired, suggesting he had lost his passion for the sport. Locker\'s decision completed the cycle of one of the biggest bust stories in modern times.  #6 Heath Shuler (1994 NFL Draft, Round 1 Pick 3) Heath Shuler would leave the NFL and have a signifcant career in politics     Heath Shuler was a standout QB prospect at the University of Tennessee, quickly becoming one of the best prospects in the SEC.  Hype over Shuler‚Äôs play increased in the build-up to the 1994 NFL Draft and he was selected as high as third-overall by Washington. A training camp holdout followed, which kept Shuler from showing his talent to the team‚Äôs coaching staff while seventh-round selection Gus Frerotte did the opposite. By the time the NFL season began, Washington fans were critical of Shuler and demanded Frerotte be given the starting job. This only became more pronounced as Shuler‚Äôs play deteriorated and he threw interception after interception. Eventually losing his starting spot with Washington, Shuler was traded to the New Orleans Saints. However, he continued to struggle before a foot injury damaged his long-term prospects. After four years in the NFL, Shuler finished with just 15 touchdown passes to his name.      #5 Andre Ware (1990 NFL Draft, Round 1 Pick 7) The 1989 Heisman Trophy winner, Andre Ware, was selected with the seventh overall pick in the 1990 NFL Draft. The Detroit Lions pinned their hopes on him, which ended in an unmitigated disaster. The Lions already had Barry Sanders on their offense and felt that Ware would be the perfect partner for him. Detroit envisaged an era of dominance where the duo would tear teams apart. However, that didn‚Äôt happen and they never even came close to doing so. In four years with the Detroit Lions, Ware started just six games, with his status in Detroit being that of a third-string QB. Many believe Ware wasn‚Äôt given a fair chance early on in Detroit. They also felt that by the time he arrived in Los Angeles and Jacksonville in 1994 and 1995 respectively, he was broken from a sporting point of view.     However, Ware couldn‚Äôt adapt to the professional environment and the seventh-overall pick had an NFL career of just five touchdown passes, 1,112 yards and six starts. That is hardly a pick well spent.  #4 Akili Smith (1999 NFL Draft, Round 1 Pick 3) Bengals fans have rued the decision to reject Mike Ditka\'s trade offer Cincinnati Bengals fans have often felt that they had a curse at the quarterback position until Joe Burrow arrived. One contributing factor to this fan paranoia is the career of 1999 NFL Draft prospect Akili Smith, who was selected by the Bengals with the third-overall pick.     A lack of college experience mixed with an athletic style that wasn‚Äôt quite dominant in the NFL yet were both factors which went against Smith. Furthermore, Bengals fans treated him harshly because the franchise had turned down Mike Ditka‚Äôs offer of nine draft picks for their #3 selection. Missing your rookie training camp courtesy of a holdout is usually a bad sign, and this proved to be the case with Smith. Pro Sports Outlook@PSO_SportsApril 17, 1999: The 1999 NFL Draft featured QB‚Äôs being drafted with each of the 1st 3 picks for the 1st time in NFL history as Tim Couch (#1 to #Browns), Donovan McNabb (#2 to #Eagles), and Akili Smith (#3 to #Bengals) all went top-3 His lack of academic intelligence was a real stumbling block, failing to grasp the playbook in Cincinnati. This was compounded by his coaches accusing him of a lack of desire to learn and study. A poor Wonderlic score prior to the NFL Draft had a lot of teams take Smith off their board.     In four years with the franchise, he started just 17 games, throwing five touchdown passes and 13 interceptions. He was then released and never played another snap in the NFL.  #3 Johnny Manziel (2014 NFL Draft, Round 1 Pick 22) Johnny Manziel wasted his NFL opportunity At this point, the sympathy for quarterbacks who have become NFL Draft busts runs thin.  Johnny Manziel cultivated a truly successful brand in the build-up to the NFL Draft in 2014. He almost forced himself on the Houston Texans and their first-overall pick, given the hype around him and the fact that he was Texas A&M‚Äôs star figure.     The problem with Johnny Money, as he so enjoyed being called, was that he simply wasn‚Äôt that good a quarterback. His college performances led to a Heisman Trophy, but NFL teams were suspicious of his talent and he slipped to #22 in the draft. Cleveland thought they had gotten a miracle bargain at this point, but Manziel proved to be trouble from the start. After receiving a fine for a hand gesture in a pre-season loss to Washington, Manziel immediately fell behind Brian Hoyer in the depth chart. His work ethic was criticized by those within the Browns organization, and his off-field activities took on an unhealthy level of importance. Injuries should facilitate periods of rehabilitation, yet Manziel often skipped these sessions, only to be seen partying.  The Browns were looking for an out by 2016, and a domestic violence incident was the perfect excuse. Cleveland cut ties with Manziel after two seasons in which he threw for 1,675 yards, seven touchdowns and seven interceptions.     A public statement released by Cleveland‚Äôs executive vice president of football operations, Sashi Brown, said a lot about Manziel. It read: ‚ÄúJohnny‚Äôs continual involvement in incidents that run counter to our expectations undermines the hard work of his teammates and our organisation.‚Äù  #2 Ryan Leaf (1998 NFL Draft, Round 1 Pick 2) Ryan Leaf was a victim of the pressure of being an NFL quarterback Ryan Leaf was an undisputed NFL Draft bust, but it wasn‚Äôt necessarily his footballing talent which was lacking.     His post-playing career has been an inspiring story of redemption and rehabilitation. However, the younger Leaf simply didn‚Äôt have the tools to deal with life as a high-profile professional athlete - something he freely admits now. Ahead of the 1998 NFL Draft, two quarterbacks stood tall at the top of the class: Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf. Few analysts and scouts could pick the two apart, and it was a coin-flip as to who the Indianapolis Colts would select with the #1 pick. The first sign that something was amiss with Leaf was when he missed a planned meeting with the Colts immediately before the NFL Draft. Indianapolis has since stated that the plan was always to take Manning, but this missed meeting lessened their opinion of Leaf significantly. He fell to the grateful San Diego Chargers at #2, but was never able to settle. Leaf\'s play initially wasn‚Äôt bad with the Chargers, but the pressure got to him. A poor performance against Kansas City led to his infamous snapping at a reporter, in which he shouted ""knock it off"" during a locker room interview.     As the pressure of his position increased, he became less stable and more erratic. He blamed teammates for his own mistakes and alienated much of the San Diego locker room. Injuries and clashes with jeering fans also plagued his second season in the NFL, and his play got worse. He had a total of 21 starts in the NFL before retiring at the age of 26. He threw 36 interceptions and 14 touchdowns, which is an almost criminal return for a #2 NFL Draft pick.  Ironically, Leaf‚Äôs legacy in the NFL is probably a positive one. He is seen as the archetypal modern NFL Draft bust and has convinced teams to analyze prospects in a different way. No longer is it just arm-strength and 40-yard times. Teams now look at the mental makeup of a young athlete and attempt to avoid drafting the next Ryan Leaf.  #1 JaMarcus Russell (2007 NFL Draft, Round 1 Pick 1)     JaMarcus Russell\'s lack of effort cost him a career in the NFL If Ryan Leaf didn‚Äôt have the tools to deal with life in the NFL, then JaMarcus Russell simply didn‚Äôt want them. The Oakland Raiders used their first-overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft to select the quarterback out of LSU and it‚Äôs difficult to think of a bigger waste of a draft choice. Russell immediately put himself in a difficult spot, refusing to turn up to training camp due to a contractual holdout. This would last until the second week of the 2007 season when he finally signed a six-year contract believed to be worth $68 million.     Russell‚Äôs effort in practice was virtually non-existent and he didn‚Äôt even make his first career start until December of the 2007 season.  This was the first-overall selection: a position that is reserved for players ready to come in and make immediate, elite contributions. Coaches with the Raiders began to doubt Russell would ever make it in the NFL, as his poor work ethic became almost a running joke within the team‚Äôs facility. There is also the now infamous story regarding coaches giving Russell a blank play-tape to study at home. The former LSU star returned the following day and talked about the plays on the tape, which rings both humorous and disheartening in equal measure. Keeping in physical shape was of no interest to Russell either and he was out of the NFL within three seasons. He threw for just 18 touchdowns and proved to be the costliest NFL Draft bust, and it was entirely self-inflicted.The Raiders paid the price in the short-term, yet the lack of regard for Russell as an athlete tells you everything about his wasteful NFL career.     ', 'Should the Indianapolis Colts draft C.J. Stroud?  C.J. Stroud is one of the top prospects in the 2023 NFL Draft and is surely on the Indianapolis Colts‚Äô radar.  The Ohio State quarterback has been nothing less than spectacular during his two years as a starter. In 2021, he recorded 4,435 passing yards, 44 touchdowns, and six interceptions. This season, he has posted 3,340 yards, 37 touchdowns, and only six interceptions. In both seasons, he finished in the top four in Heisman voting.

Minshew was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the sixth round (178th overall pick) of the 2019 NFL Draft. He ended up starting 12 games as a rookie, throwing for 3,271 yards, 21 touchdowns and six interceptions. After starting eight games for the Jaguars the following season, Minshew was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in August 2021 as he became a backup.

He threw for 355 yards and two touchdowns although the Eagles lost 40-34. In his career thus far, Minshew has started 24 of 32 games, producing 6,632 passing yards, 44 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.  Gardner Minshew knows Shane Steichen's offense. Ever since Andrew Luck retired in 2019, the Colts have gone the veteran quarterback route, acquiring players like Philip Rivers, Carson Wentz and Matt Ryan. This year should be different, though, as the Colts are expected to draft a quarterback. The team owns the fourth overall pick in the draft and will likely select Alabama's Bryce Young, Ohio State's C.J. Stroud or Kentucky's Will Levis.If that happens, a bridge quarterback could be acquired to fill in until the youngster is ready to start. Minshew would be perfect for that role. He played for new Colts head coach Shane Steichen, who served as the Eagles' offensive coordinator. Plus, if the rookie quarterback struggles mightily, Minshew could take over as the starter.

To claim the number 1 seed in the NFC, the 13-1 Philadelphia Eagles only have to win one of their next three outings.

In his rookie year, he rapidly established himself as the team\'s main starting QB and set the team record for throwing touchdowns by a first-year QB. He was moved to the Philadelphia Eagles the following year, where he has been the team\'s number two QB, after an injury cut short his 2020 season. Minshew has only featured in two full games in the regular season in Philadelphia after playing a total of 23 games over the last two years in Jacksonville, where he threw for 37 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.      One of the two complete games Minshew has played was against a weak New York Jets secondary in a top-10 fantasy performance, and the other in a difficult game versus the Dallas Cowboys in Week 18. He attempted eight deep balls, passed for 428 yards, 362 air yards, four touchdowns, and one interception in these two games.

He is a reliable thrower who displayed some skill when playing for the Jaguars in his first two NFL seasons. In his career, he has thrown for 41 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.     Jalen Hurts is seen as a top MVP-caliber, and the 26-year-old Minshew will have huge shoes to fill if he is selected in Week 16. Hurts threw for almost 3,500 yards and 22 TDs while also carrying for 747 yards and 13 scores.

The Jacksonville Jaguars drafted him as their future quarterback. Minshew took the opportunity with both hands and put up a fantastic rookie stat line of 3,271 passing yards, 21 touchdowns, and six interceptions in 14 games. His next season was just as impressive, with the then-year-two Pro putting up a stat line of 2,259 passing yards, 16 touchdowns, and five interceptions in six games. However, his efforts weren't enough to keep him in Jacksonville, as the Jaguars traded him to the Philadelphia Eagles to make room for an incoming Trevor Lawrence.     Since joining Philly, Minshew has played as a backup for the regular playoff contenders. He has played in a mere seven games for Philly, thrown for under 500 passing yards, scored four touchdowns, and been intercepted once. He hopes to improve that stat line on Saturday when he takes to the Gridiron without starting quarterback Jalen Hurts.Overall, Minshew has played in thirty NFL games.

', 'Are Philadelphia Eagles still unsure about QB Jalen Hurts? Philadelphia trades for Jacksonville QB Gardner Minshew  The Philadelphia Eagles may have made a very underrated roster move by acquiring QB Garnder Minshew from the Jacksonville Jaguars, adding to a roster with Jalen Hurts and Joe Flacco already in place. Gardner Minshew lost a QB ""battle"" that he was never seriously going to win against the number one overall pick Trevor Lawrence. Minshew was a breakout star in 2019 when he took over for Nick Foles. In 2020, he struggled on the field with a lingering hand injury that impacted his performance. The Jaguars drafted Lawrence, a generational talent, and it was just a matter of time before they traded Gardner Minshew as he wasn\'t going to unseat Trevor Lawrence any time soon.  Trade: #Eagles have acquired QB Gardner Minshew from Jacksonville in exchange for a conditional sixth-round pick in 2022. The team also released QB Nick Mullens. pic.twitter.com/MLYrJfymxE‚Äî Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) August 28, 2021        Gardner Minshew trade shows uncertainty with Jalen Hurts...and Jacksonville Jaguars head coach?           Enter the Philadelphia Eagles, who have been in deep thought on what Jalen Hurts\' future holds with the team. Through three NFL preseason games, Jalen Hurts saw action only in Week 1 as the starter (3/7 for 54 yards). QB Joe Flacco played most of the preseason and played well, too. Philadelphia seems to be hinting to Jalen Hurts that his time as a starter could be in jeopardy by offering a sixth-round pick for Gardner Minshew. So yes, the Philadelphia Eagles are still not sold on Jalen Hurts being the face of their franchise. That doesn\'t mean he\'ll be benched immediately for Flacco or Minshew, who is #3 on the depth chart. The team does have options at QB now though, if injury, COVID-19, or regression strikes Jalen Hurts. Flacco had a great preseason and showed he can still perform with success in the NFL, but he\'s not suited to lead Nick Sirianni\'s offense. It requires a smaller, more mobile and athletic player and that has never been Joe Flacco. Gardner Minshew, on the other hand, looks like a prime candidate for such a system. The Eagles do not know if he\'ll be more like the 2019 or 2020 Gardner Minshew, though. It would be smart not to give Minshew responsibilities on the offense before he earns them.     Eagles just landed a 25-year old QB that has completed 62.9% with 37 TD, only 11 INT, and 93.1% rating in his first two seasons for a stinking 6th round pick. Gardner Minshew is a winning NFL quarterback. Absolute no-brainer deal for Howie Roseman.‚Äî Jim Nagy (@JimNagy_SB) August 28, 2021 Jacksonville dropped the ball with Gardner Minshew Giving up a sixth-round pick for a QB with 5,530 passing yards and 37 passing TDs in two years is a steal and says more about the dysfunction and uncertainty in Jacksonville than Philadelphia. The so-called QB competition seemed like an act to boost Minshew\'s trade value, which failed obviously and leaves HC Urban Meyer to be criticized for such a move. Still, Philadelphia does well to have extra options at QB, something they\'ve been known to do over the years.     Despite playing 13 less full games, Jalen Hurts had more 300+ passing yard performances than Baker Mayfield.In Hurts‚Äô 3 game stretch of full starts, he also averaged more YPG, TD per game, and had a higher Comp %.#Eagles pic.twitter.com/mpF8OkEpb4‚Äî Eagles Nation (@PHLEaglesNation) August 23, 2021 Jalen Hurts has potential, but needs to utilize it early in 2021 Jalen Hurts is still just 23 with only four career starts, even though it may feel he\'s played more than that. A 1-3 record isn\'t great and neither is a 52% completion rate, 6 TDs, and four INTs. The upside is that he\'s shown he can lead, the offense respects him, and he\'s had 300+ yards in two of his four starts. He\'s played much better in training camp, but he really needed the reps in the preseason regardless of the Eagles wanting to rest him to prevent an injury. Jalen Hurts\' small amount of playing time in his career isn\'t large enough to really allow him to have a long leash as a starter and he will be under the microscope. While Gardner Minshew\'s arrival isn\'t a formal answer to Jalen Hurts losing his starting job, it does prove the Eagles feel they need to have suitable options on the depth chart. Don\'t bet on Philadelphia having a winning season in 2021.

The Washington State University alum was a stud in college, and he ensured that his University team was never blown out of the water by more illustrious competition. However, since joining the league as a sixth-round pick, he has had an up-and-down career, to put it mildly. He started his NFL journey with the Jacksonville Jaguars at a franchise that looked to entrust him with the key to their franchise for the long run. He repaid that trust by putting back-to-back solid seasons by a starting quarterback's standard.

They lost the game 26 - 6 and much of the blame fell on Dak Prescott. They were playing essentially a reserve team in the eliminated Commanders. They were the favorites to win this game. But by the end of the game, Dak Prescott had a 37.8 percent completion percentage, throwing for less than 130 passing yards, one touchdown, and one interception return for a touchdown.

Joshua Dobbs was playing his first game for the Tennessee Titans after signing from the Detroit Lions\' practice squad. Sam Howell is the third-choice quarterback for the Commanders behind Carson Wentz and Taylor Heinicke.     Each of these should have been blowout wins.

Over his 11 seasons in the NFL, Nick Foles has experienced many highs and lows of being an elite-level quarterback. From winning a Super Bowl in his second stint with the Eagles to sustaining a litany of injuries, his career has seen various milestones and heartbreaks.  As of this writing, Foles has earned $86 million solely from football. His last contract was in 2022, when he joined the Indianapolis Colts for $6.2 million, with $4 million guaranteed. He was waived on May 5.        The most lucrative contract Foles has ever had was for four years and $88 million with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He signed the deal in 2019, fresh off his second straight year bringing the Eagles to at least the Divisional Round in relief of Carson Wentz.           However, he suffered a shoulder injury right in Week 1, and ultimately started (and played) only three more games. Including the season opener, he lost all his starts and was eventually benched for then-rookie Gardner Minshew. He was then traded to the Chicago Bears, who released him after 2021. Besides his earnings on the field, Foles also has had endorsements with athletic apparel brands Under Armour and Lululemon (specifically its men's line) and coffee and food maker Bulletproof 360. Unfortunately, no specific figures have been released about his off-field earnings. Foles has spoken about not earning as much off the field as he does on it. Speaking to Men's Journal, he explained why he had been declining endorsement deals throughout his career:     For my own sanity, I try to say no to things, especially when it comes to corporate endorsements. If you‚Äôre an NFL player, companies will throw money at you to put your name on stuff, and it can get crazy. He also emphasized his need to stay true to his morals, which meant not selling out: My wife and I have been blessed, and giving is a big part of what we do. I don‚Äôt want to act fake to rep a product I don‚Äôt believe in. Being genuine is more important to me than trying to cash in on every opportunity.  Why have the Indianapolis Colts released Nick Foles? Anthony Richardson is the focal point of a massive rebuild in Indianapolis, making Nick Foles expendable     Foles' release from the Colts was something to be expected, as he played poorly in the two games he started, both towards the end of the season. He did not throw a single touchdown, instead getting intercepted four times, as well as giving up four sacks for a loss of 48 yards. Another reason for Foles' departure is the Colts' desire to rebuild around fourth overall pick Anthony Richardson. Fans have mockingly claimed that Richardson's minicamp performance impressed the front office enough to make Foles expendable, but an offensive core of Richardson, running back Jonathan Taylor, and wide receivers Michael Pittman Jr. and Josh Downs may return the Colts to the playoffs.

47,Jacoby Brissett,"[""Jacoby Brissett contract: How much will the former Browns QB earn with Commanders?  The Washington Commanders announced on Wednesday that they are signing quarterback Jacoby Brissett to a one-year deal worth $10 million.  The team lost quarterback Taylor Heinicke to free agency as he signed with the Atlanta Falcons and released quarterback Carson Wentz after just one season. Getting Brissett on board allows the Commanders to not overspend at quarterback.        Brissett was one of the best QBs available in the market after a good season with the Cleveland Browns. Although the team could not produce good results, it still saw their quarterback have some good individual performances. This was before Deshaun Watson took over following an 11-game suspension.           With the NFC East having Jalen Hurts and Dak Prescott as top quarterbacks, and the Philadelphia Eagles looking strong, Commanders had to find a stable veteran option. They, meanwhile, continue to search for long-term options. The new contract given by the Commanders includes $8 million in guaranteed money. Why are the Commanders signing Jacoby Brissett? Jacoby Brissett     He was a good quarterback last year, although the win-loss record doesn't back it up. He had some good performances while the Cleveland Browns' roster was not prepared to win games. Also, it was admirable to see him perform well even though he knew his stint as the starter would end. Brissett is not the kind of quarterback that will take you to the Super Bowl, but the Commanders are not contending anyway. The roster still needs more tools, and he's a quarterback with a low interception rate. He has played in 76 games before and has never thrown more than seven interceptions in a single season. Washington's idea is just to get the position stabilized as they study the quarterback's prospects. Will they move up in the draft to leapfrog other contenders for the position? Who knows. But they have a true chance of winning games with their new signing.The Commanders are not a team that would be a contender anyway, so at least they're making sure they don't give up on the season. A veteran quarterback is always the best option when you don't have anything for the long term yet, even though they have a lot of faith in Sam Howell.     "", ""Should the Dolphins sign Cam Newton? ‚Äì NFL Rumors  The era of Tua Tagovailoa may be going on hiatus for the Miami Dolphins after Tagovailoa suffered a rib injury and was carted off the field. In his place, Jacoby Brissett stepped up and put together a rough performance, throwing for 169 yards and an interception en route to a Week Two loss. The performance sets a dark tone for the near future.  The Dolphins, a win-now organization in 2021, could be looking to the market for anyone who can give the team a boost to weather the injury. Luckily for them, Cam Newton is available just weeks after being cut in New England. Would Cam Newton be a good fit with the Dolphins?        Dolphins diving deep for Cam Newton?           The Patriots and the Dolphins are sworn enemies but the modern-day Dolphins are heavily influenced by the team. Their head coach, Brian Flores, was a position coach under Bill Belichick.

Of course, the Dolphins defeated the Patriots in Week 1, but the win was largely a result of Mac Jones' first start. He may be much different by the next time the two teams play. Anything the Dolphins can do to stay ahead of the Patriots should be done.     As an added bonus, by signing Cam Newton, the Dolphins would be keeping the Patriots from re-signing the quarterback if they change their minds. If something were to happen to Mac Jones, the Patriots would have no choice but to lean on Brian Hoyer. This would keep the Patriots down while keeping the Dolphins up.     The Dolphins are serious about the playoffs this season, so it makes sense to sign a quarterback who has plenty of playoff experience. It may have been a while for Cam Newton, but he has already shown he can perform in the playoffs. He knows how to deal with the pressure of the moment and can provide advice to Tagovailoa if he makes the playoffs.     Cam Newton after Super Bowl 50 between Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos Lastly, if the Dolphins somehow make the Super Bowl with Newton, they would have a quarterback who could deal with that pressure. He's already been there and, having lost one, his level of focus could elevate to a higher level. Needless to say, if Newton were to find himself in the Super Bowl again, he would dive on the fumble.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 3 TV Schedule     "", ""Donovan Peoples-Jones fantasy outlook Week 10  Donovan Peoples-Jones has become a vital member of the Cleveland Browns' offensive unit this season.

Yet the 13-3 victory did not exactly feature a legendary performance from the quarterback. He finished 18/28 for 161 yards and threw for the only touchdown in the game. The defense was the reason the Browns cruised to victory, which is a rare fact to type out this season.        Cleveland is now 2-1 with Watson under center.

Cleveland Browns@BrownsFirst home win feels @deshaunwatson | #Browns1863323 Saturday marked his first home game, and his stats actually went down from last week's loss against the Cincinnati Bengals. Yet the weather was freezing, and most importantly, he did not turn the ball over like he did in his first two games back. Just getting wins will endear him to the fanbase at this point. The problem is that below-average performances from him could mean another losing record if this carries over into 2023. Jacoby Brissett provided admirable quarterback play in the first 11 games of the year, and because of defensive woes, the team had a 4-7 record.     If the defense does not improve, Watson may have to play at a Pro Bowl level just to have the Browns in contention in the division. And that is assuming a return to that level of play is still possible for him after his long absence. The 11-game suspension meant the entire organization began focusing on 2023, with 2022 as an evaluation period for the entire roster.

"", ""Joe Burrow's record vs. Browns now 0-4 as Bengals QB struggles on MNF\xa0  Mondays aren't all bad, right? If football isn't enough to give some excitement to the week's first weekday, Halloween should do the trick. Combine the two, and you get the Browns vs. Bengals on Monday Night Football.  Cleveland, riding low on a four-game losing streak, hosted the Cincinnati Bengals who were fresh off back-to-back victories. With a 0-4 record throughout October, the Browns had one last shot at winning a football game this month as the final day of the month approached.        After four quarters of football, Cleveland did just that, besting their AFC North rivals from Cincinnati in dominant fashion - and had a little fun with it afterward.           Cleveland Browns@Brownsput the word out2931519 When you think of a blowout, this is the type of contest that should come to mind. Not only did Cleveland enjoy a four-possession victory after three quarters, but the team held Burrow and company to a total of zero points during this timeframe. A quarter later, the Browns walked away with a 32-13 win.     Quarterback Jacoby Brissett put on a show, logging 278 yards and a touchdown. Brissett finished the contest with a QB rating of 133.7, accompanied by a completion percentage of 77.3%.    Brissett's contributions were instrumental in making sure Joe Burrow retained a winless record against Cleveland throughout his career. The 25-year-old who appeared in a Super Bowl earlier this calendar year drops to 0-4 when these two clubs faceoff.  Joe Burrow's woes against the Cleveland Browns continues     Atlanta Falcons v Cincinnati Bengals At the end of the '21 season, Joe Burrow was playing in the Super Bowl. On the other hand, Cleveland finished the year with a losing record. So how can it be that Joe Burrow has never won a game against the Browns? Burrow has played Cleveland four times since being drafted; twice during his rookie season, once last year, and a final time this Monday. Through it all, the first-overall pick in 2020 can't seem to walk away with a victory.     The two contests during his rookie season were close, with the Bengals losing by one possession each time. Combined, Burrow totaled 6 passing touchdowns and only one interception, surpassing the 300-yard mark through the air on both occasions. His last two performances against Cleveland, though, have been disastrous. During his meetup with the Browns last season, Burrow threw two interceptions with zero touchdowns on his way to a 16-41 blowout loss against his rivals in Ohio. On Monday, during his latest showdown against Cleveland, he was on the wrong side of a blowout once more. Under Burrow, Cincinnati went three full quarters without putting up a single point on the scoreboard. Burrow recorded an interception early on, and in the meantime, it took nearly 45 minutes for the Bengals' offense to reach 100+ scrimmage yards. Now down by four possessions with one quarter left to play, Burrow was able to dress up the stat column a bit by tossing two touchdowns, including one to Tee Higgins that put him north of 200 passing yards for the day.     Cincinnati Bengals@BengalsTee takes it to the endzone#CINvsCLE |  ESPN66952His first few years haven't treated Burrow kindly when it comes to contests against the Browns, but the 25-year-old will have a chance to earn his first victory against Cleveland at the end of the season.     "", ""The Browns had no choice but to excuse Baker Mayfield from OTAs  The Cleveland Browns and Baker Mayfield have been playing a game of chicken with each other over the past few months. The franchise has not yet released him or found a trade partner and the quarterback has expressed no interest in being with them in any capacity.  But something had to be decided this week as mandatory minicamps are underway around the NFL. Mayfield is still under contract with the team and missing mandatory practice could lead to fines in the tens of thousands.                     Ultimately, the Browns made the wise move by just telling Mayfield to stay home. He won't be fined, and the team can continue to figure out what to do with him as the season approaches. This was the right move for a variety of reasons. Baker Mayfield would have been a massive distraction for a team with too many at the moment     Cleveland Browns Offseason Workout The Browns are in an unimaginably bad spot at the moment because of Deshaun Watson. He was signed to a fully-guaranteed $230 million deal, and cost a lot of draft capital which was sent the Houston Texans' way. There is currently no guarantee he will play at all this year as the lawsuits against him continue to grow. The worst thing the Browns could do for their own future would be to have Mayfield show up and work with the offense during OTAs. If he performs well, it only has the potential to cause a rift among the entire team as to what to do if Watson is suspended.     Jacoby Brissett is the top backup at the moment and will presumably play if Watson gets suspended. Throwing the former number-one pick into the mix after this offseason filled with drama would only create more at a time when any sort of stability is needed.    So what is the best option? A release is the easiest option here, even if it means the team eats nearly $19 million. A trade is also still likely at some point before the season, even if it seems impossible at the moment. That is because teams may deal with injuries, or severely bad performances, that require an adjustment before Week 1.     For example, the Seattle Seahawks may come to see that the competition between Drew Lock and Geno Smith is going nowhere. Adding someone like Mayfield in an attempt to salvage the season makes sense. The same is true for a team like the Carolina Panthers. The Houston Texans may also fall into that category, but a trade between them and the Browns is unlikely given the Watson situation.Mayfield even showing up at minicamp would have dominated the headlines and led to even more distractions. Both sides are taking a smart approach here and just accepting that a split is the best decision.Also Checkout:- Stefon Digg's Contract     "", 'Redditors shocked over Deshaun Watson\'s 11-game suspension  Deshaun Watson was initially given a six-game suspension but the NFL appealed the ruling.

The quarterback added that his decisions placed him in the position he was in: ""The decisions that I made in my life that put me in this position I would definitely like to have back. But I want to continue to move forward and grow and learn and show that I am a true person of character and I am going to keep pushing forward.""     It seems the 26-year-old apologized and maintained his innocence within a span of days. Watson was accused by over two dozen women who accused him of sexual assault and sexual harassment during massage sessions.

Deshaun Watson returns to the Cleveland Browns in Week 13 against the Houston Texans Deshaun Watson at Cleveland Browns Training Camp     Remarkably, Deshaun Watson will return in Week 13 against his former team, the Houston Texans. The question is whether the Browns will still be in playoff contention by that point. They are set to start Jacoby Brissett for the duration of Watson\'s suspension. He will be backed up by Josh Rosen and Joshua Dobbs. Brissett is definitely good enough to win a few games for the Browns, who will likely lean heavily on their running game. To have any chance of making the postseason, they will need Brissett to win at least six games. From there, Watson will have to hit the ground running upon his return. Watson had a poor performance in his preseason debut against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He completed one pass for seven yards from five attempts. It will be interesting to see if so much time away from the field will be an issue for him when he returns.

Brissett can also start for an extended period if required. Washington DC Sports News@DCSportsNews365Commanders make move for veteran presence in QB room that has fresh starts under his belt (11 starts last season) and is a dual run-throw threat. Jacoby Brissett was a good pickup by the Commanders #HTTC82     Washington gained a starter at both guard and tackle positions. Andrew Wylie is versatile and is expected to play right tackle, while Cosmi moves to guard. Wylie had a strong Super Bowl performance against Eagles pass rusher Hassan Reddick. Minimal risk is associated with the signing, as Wylie is not ultra-expensive. Nick Gates will provide competition for the starting center position. Washington has had many health issues at center in the past two seasons, and Gates is known for his tough and physical blocking. This is what the team wants, especially in their run game. The only risk associated with Gates is his health, given that he is returning from a severe leg injury. Danny Johnson - Minnesota Vikings v Washington Commanders     Danny Johnson has played as a backup corner for the Commanders over the past two years. He has done a nice job in this role, and the team values him due to his versatility, which allows him to play inside or outside. The only risk associated with Johnson is his lack of contributions to special teams. Cody Barton has signed a one-year deal with Washington and will play as a middle linebacker. He had a strong second half for Seattle last season and will be playing behind a line that protects him more than the Seahawks' front. This should allow him to make more plays in the run game. The only risk associated with Barton is his inconsistency as a developing player. Tyler Larsen has been signed to provide more depth and stronger options at the center position. The team has struggled with injuries in the past two seasons, and Larsen adds a solid backup option, particularly in run-blocking. The only risk associated with Larsen is his durability and consistency, which have been issues for the Commanders in the past.     Efe Obada has signed a one-year deal as a backup defensive end who can also play as a tackle in different packages. He is known for his versatility and recorded four sacks as a backup last season. The only risk associated with Obada is his age, as he is not a young pass rusher, but Washington has good depth along their defensive line.

This is because six NFL teams are on a bye week.  Fewer teams playing means fewer options to choose from in Fantasy Football this week. This is particularly crucial for the quarterback position as each NFL team generally only uses one of them each week. With six teams in a bye week, only 26 starting quarterbacks will play a game, compared to a maximum of 32 quarterbacks.        Dak Prescott and Russell Wilson headline the quarterbacks that are not playing this week, along with Jimmy Garoppolo and Daniel Jones, who may be used as starters during other weeks. While Jacoby Brissett and Kenny Pickett will also be unavailable this week.               Fantasy managers featuring any of the six quarterbacks on their rosters will need to look at a replacement. Matchups are always important during each week of the Fantasy Football season, as well as paying attention to recent trends and performances.

From the 199th pick of the NFL Draft, Brady went on to become arguably the greatest quarterback the NFL has ever seen. Similarly, Mr. Irrelevant, who was the last pick in this year\'s draft, now looks to be leading a franchise capable of winning the Super Bowl. In both cases, Purdy and Brady came in after starters went down injured. For Drew Bledsoe, read Jimmy Garoppolo. Dov Kleiman@NFL_DovKleiman#49ers QBs:Jimmy Garoppolo - two deep TD passes in 3 years.Brock Purdy - two deep TD passes in one quarter of his 1st NFL start (FS1)1532151 So, there are a lot of similarities between the two quarterbacks. They have come into the league forgotten and underestimated. They took over more established quarterbacks and then made it seem all too easy. In all seriousness, Purdy might not be the next Brady. But if he keeps playing like this, he might be the first Brock Purdy. Sometimes, that is all one needs.     ', ""Jalen Hurts vs Brock Purdy: The NFC championship game\xa0  The NFC championship game on Sunday will feature the Philadelphia Eagles, led by quarterback Jalen Hurts, taking on the San Francisco 49ers, led by rookie quarterback Brock Purdy.  Both teams have had impressive seasons, with the Eagles finishing as the top seed and the 49ers as the second seed. Both fought hard throughout the season to earn the right to compete to advance to the Super Bowl.        This matchup will showcase two talented quarterbacks.           Hurts is coming off an impressive performance against the New York Giants, while Purdy has stepped up for the 49ers, leading them to a 7-0 record following injuries to their starting quarterbacks.

The Eagles have one of the league's best offenses and defenses. San Francisco 49ers Brock Purdy The 49ers are no pushovers either, with one of the NFL's best running games, thanks to the addition of Christian McCaffrey. They also have one of the game's best defenders in Nick Bosa, who is in contention for the Defensive Player of the Year award. This NFC championship game will be a true test for both teams as they face off against formidable opponents.

"", ""Who is Brock Purdy's brother, Chubba?  Brock Purdy surprised everyone with his performance as he crippled the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday in the week 14 matchup. Purdy started his first game of the season and led the San Francisco 49ers to a 35-7 win over the Tom Brady-leading Buccaneers.  The 49ers selected him as the 262nd and final pick of the 2022 NFL draft. No one would have imagined that he would play such a big role for the 49ers as he was the third choice on the quarterback depth chart after Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo.        While Trey Lance has been ruled out of the season, Jimmy Garoppolo was injured in the week 13 game against the Dolphins.           As Brock Purdy has been trending for a few days, there is another football star quarterback who shares the same surname. He is none other than Chubba Purdy. Chubba Purdy is Brock's younger brother and plays quarterback for the Nebraska Huskers. He is in his third year of collegiate play after spending his first two years at Florida State.        Purdy played in three games with one start for Florida State. In addition to rushing 19 times for 57 yards, he completed 27 of his 53 passes for 219 yards and two touchdowns. In 2020, he began the game against North Carolina State and finished 15 of 23 for 181 yards and two touchdowns. His first touchdown throw was a 69-yarder that turned out to be the largest pass play of 2020 for the Seminoles. In 2022, Chubba received an offer from both Oklahoma and Nebraska. Chubba has always dreamed of being a Husker and joined them in January 2022. Purdy has played in six games this season and has thrown for 147 yards with seven interceptions. He has also rushed for 73 yards in 24 attempts and scored two touchdowns. While he might not be a star player like his brother Brock, he is definitely on the path to becoming something bigger. After graduating from high school, Purdy, a 4-star talent from Gilbert, Arizona, signed with the Seminoles. He was ranked No. 192 overall, No. 7 among dual-threat quarterbacks nationwide, and No. 6 among Arizona prospects by 247 Sports.

Purdy had some stellar performances last season, including defeating possibly the greatest quarterback in NFL history.  On the New Heights podcast, Purdy shared what it was like to defeat Tom Brady as a rookie signal-caller:        ‚ÄúIt was a dream. And just seeing him after and, you know, obviously we won, which was special, but just seeing him after being able to dap him up, I was like standing there looking at him.

It felt like a dream.‚Äù                  Brock Purdy and the 49ers faced Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 14 last season. The 49ers dominated the Buccaneers by a score of 35 - 7. Purdy threw for 185 yards and two touchdowns while running for another touchdown. The 49ers rookie was the first quarterback to defeat the recently retired Brady in their first NFL start. Purdy was the final pick in last year\'s NFL Draft, aka Mr. Irrelevant. In all, the former Iowa State star had 1,374 yards, 13 touchdowns, and four interceptions in five starts for San Francisco in the 2022 season.  Will Brock Purdy be the 49ers starter in 2023? Purdy suffered a severe injury to his elbow versus the Philadelphia Eagles in the playoffs last season. There were reports that Purdy will reportedly not need Tommy John surgery. The surgery would have all ended any chance of him playing this upcoming season. However, he did have successful non-Tommy John surgery to fix his right elbow.       This is welcome news for both Purdy and the 49ers as he could likely be the franchise\'s starting quarterback in 2023. He\'ll be competing for the starting job against Trey Lance, their top pick in the 2021 Draft, and veteran Sam Darnold. We\'ll see if Brock Purdy is ready by the start of the upcoming season.     ', 'Russell Wilson who? Geno Smith is officially the future for Seahawks  Geno Smith and the Seattle Seahawks have officially been sent home after losing to the San Francisco 49ers in the opening round of the postseason. Seattle did score 23 points, but gave up 41 in a dominating performance by Brock Purdy and the 49ers offense.  Losing in the playoffs is obviously frustrating and not what the Seahawks had in mind. However, there are plenty of positives to take from the entire season, mainly at the quarterback position.        Geno Smith answered an important question in 2022           Los Angeles Rams v Seattle Seahawks Russell Wilson leaving Seattle could have marked a major rebuilding period getting underway. Instead, Smith won the job and picked up a statement win in Week 1 over Wilson and the Denver Broncos. The well-traveled quarterback finished the regular season with 30 touchdowns and over 4,200 yards. He was not just good, he was great. Bob Condotta@bcondottaGeno Smith says he wants to finish his career in Seattle.1060105     Cut to Saturday and he was trying to do the impossible, which was go on the road and take down the mighty 49ers. To Smith\'s credit, he did finish with 253 yards and two touchdowns. However, he had a costly interception in a game when zero mistakes were allowed if they wanted to pull off the upset. Yet the quarterback proved his worth this year and is still only 32 years old. Keep in mind the Seahawks have the No. 5 pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, thanks to the Wilson trade with Denver. This creates the possibility of taking a top quarterback prospect, such as Bryce Young, CJ Stroud, or Will Levis. However, taking a rookie may mean a rebuild is in fact in place. Why take an unproven rookie when a 32-year-old talented quarterback is already an option? Dov Kleiman@NFL_DovKleimanEugene Cyril ""Geno"" Smith to DeKaylin Zecharius ""DK"" Metcalf for a 50-yard touchdown in the playoffs to tie it up, with a chance to lead.67487     Smith is a free agent and will be seeking a proper salary in 2023. Yet he is not going to touch the top tier of the market, meaning he can be retained and the Seahawks can use that early pick for another position of need, such as on the offensive line. Throwing for 30 touchdowns is no fluke. He waited for his second act in the NFL and elevated a Seattle team that could have easily focused on draft position this season. A full offseason preparing as the starter will only help, which retaining him sends a message to the team that the goal is still to compete in 2023.Seeing the way Smith played compared to Wilson this season should tell the Seahawks front office all they need to know about their 2023 plans. They made a smart move and should stick with it.     ', ""Antonio Brown flames Tom Brady with hilarious Brock Purdy meme after Buccaneers‚Äô Week 14 pantsing vs 49ers  Antonio Brown continues to find ways to mock Tom Brady. His former teammate was the subject of a brutal beatdown against the San Francisco 49ers, the third-worst of his career. It's been a trying season for Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Brown has taken advantage of that.  He has often mocked his former quarterback for off-field struggles, but this time he went straight after his performance on the field. Rookie third-string quarterback Brock Purdy, who was the last pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, defeated Brady in his first ever start.        Brown posted an image to his Snapchat story with Purdy's face photoshopped onto a father and Brady's face photoshopped onto the child.           Barstool ISU@BarstoolISUANTONIO BROWN just put this on his Snapchat story ü§£117028 It was a humbling experience for Brady, who lost to a quarterback in their first career start for the first time in his lengthy and illustrious career.        The 49ers defense made life miserable for the quarterback, whose team could only muster seven points. Brady finished with just 253 yards and two interceptions. It was a bad day for the team and it has only gotten worse online in the aftermath.  Is Tom Brady going to retire? The Buccaneers are 6-7 and Tom Brady doesn't look like himself. After he retired earlier this year, many are wondering if he'll walk away after a poor season on and off the field. However, that doesn't seem to be on the cards. Many around the league don't think he is acting or talking like a player on his way out the door.        Brady's father and NFL Hall of Famer Cris Carter aren't sure he'll ever retire, which worries them. All signs point to the quarterback returning next season. That may not be with Tampa Bay, though. There are rumors of a New England Patriots reunion as well as a homecoming with the 49ers. Tom Brady may go to the 49ers nextWith Tampa's struggles and the lack of a future there, he probably won't be on that team next year as he is a free agent this offseason. Whether he goes to New England or San Francisco remains to be seen, but he will most likely play somewhere next year.     "", '""Straight hate by a guy who is jealous""- Tom Brady debate prompts Skip Bayless to take personal shots at Shannon Sharpe  Things between Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe got heated beyond anyone\'s wildest expectations during a debate about Tom Brady\'s performance in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\' embarrassing 35-7 loss to Brock Purdy the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.  During Monday\'s episode of Undisputed on FS1, Sharpe was highly critical of Brady\'s performance, calling out the quarterback for his poor performance while passing the ball. Brady completed only 34 of his 55 pass attempts for 253 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.         Tom Brady debate sparks petty argument between Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe           Bayless offered poor retorts to Sharpe\'s legitimate criticism of Tom Brady\'s performance, before accusing the NFL Hall of Famer of being jealous of the seven-time Super Bowl champion. When Sharpe called out Bayless for claiming that Brady watches more film than the Buccaneers coaching staff and that the quarterback was the one to blame for the team\'s blowout loss against the 49ers, the latter responded: ""This is straight hate by a guy who is jealous that he\'s still playing at a high level at 45, when you [Sharpe] had to stop at 35. That\'s the point."" Sharpe replied: ""Skip, that\'s what you do. Every time I call something into question, [you claim] I am jealous. I did what I did. You make it sound like I was a bum. I\'m in the NFL Hall of Fame. I got three Super Bowls.""     Bayless snapped back: ""So what? [Brady\'s] way better than you were!"" A visibly upset Sharpe took his glasses off and continued to argue his case: ""You are willing to take a personal shot at me. To say this man is better than me because I said he\'s playing bad this year?"" Watch the entire argument below:     Bayless responded that Sharpe\'s comments about Tom Brady were disrespectful and the former NFL star responded that the veteran analyst\'s jibe at him was just as disrespectful. The argument eventually cooled down after Sharpe took a backseat and allowed Bayless to make his case and defend Brady\'s performance against the 49ers. What started off as a passionate debate devolved into a petty argument.      ', '5 rookies to beat Tom Brady feat. Brock Purdy  Brock Purdy leading the San Francisco 49ers to a victory over Tom Brady was a huge shock, but he joins a select list of rookies who have defeated the GOAT.  In truth, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were barely involved in the 35-7 defeat on Sunday evening, but the highlight of the night was Purdy.        Picked as Mr. Irrelevant in 2022, Purdy didn‚Äôt expect to see any NFL reps this season.           He has since watched Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo go down with injuries and he has taken his chance expertly. Front Office Sports@FOSBrock Purdy was the 262nd and final pick of the 2022 NFL Draft ‚Äî dubbed ""Mr. Irrelevant.""Today, the rookie out of Iowa State: Scored three TDs Had a 134 passer rating Led a 35-7 win over Tampa He becomes the first QB to beat Tom Brady in his first career start.2004245 While it‚Äôs too early to suggest this is akin to a Tom Brady/Drew Bledsoe situation, defeating the greatest quarterback to ever live should always be seen as an achievement, not least when you are only a rookie yourself.     This is an honor that very few starting QBs can claim to have, with the list unlikely to get much longer given the fact Brady is perhaps entering the final games of his distinguished career. But just who are 5 noteworthy rookies who have beaten Tom Brady in their debut year? 5. Ben Roethlisberger ‚Äì Pittsburgh Steelers (2004) Rookie Big Ben would notch up 15 regular season wins While somewhat of a sideshow in the 2004 NFL Draft due to the drama involving Eli Manning and the San Diego Chargers, Big Ben would enjoy a fabulous rookie season.     Not only did he immediately settle into life with the Pittsburgh Steelers, he also finished the regular season with a 15-1 record. While a Super Bowl appearance eluded the young quarterback, he did manage to record a victory over a younger Tom Brady, who was rapidly approaching his own prime. In a Week 8 match-up, the New England Patriots would lose their 21-game winning streak as Ben Roethlisberger played a perfect game. He threw for 196 yards and had a QB rating of 126.4. He threw two touchdown passes and totally outclassed Brady, who threw two interceptions on the day. 4. Russell Wilson ‚Äì Seattle Seahawks (2012) Russell Wilson enjoyed a memorable rookie season     Russell Wilson was forced to live through one of his most painful moments when he lost a Super Bowl to Tom Brady and the Patriots, but he was first able to enjoy a rookie win over Tom Terrific. By this point, in 2012, TB12 had established himself as one of the greatest players the NFL had ever seen. Of course, his legacy had yet to be bolstered by further Super Bowl wins, but a win for rookie Wilson would do a lot for his reputation. People need to remember just what a surprise Russell Wilson‚Äôs success was. He was an undersized QB taken in the third round of the draft. However, he found a place to thrive in Seattle and came out on top in a Week 6 nailbiter against the Pats. The rookie completed 16 of 27 passes for 293 yards and three touchdowns, without a single interception. However, it could be argued that the Seahawks rode their luck in the 24-23 win as Tom Brady played well.     He threw the ball 58 times that evening, completing 36 passes for 395 yards. He threw two touchdown passes, but also two interceptions. 3. Geno Smith ‚Äì New York Jets (2013) A rookie win over Tom Brady was the highlight of an awful New York Jets career for Geno Smith Geno Smith‚Äôs career renaissance in Seattle has been one of 2022‚Äôs best stories, yet there has been a lot of water under the bridge since his rookie year in New York. Taking on the unenviable position as the starting quarterback for the New York Jets, Smith found life very difficult. He made a lot of mistakes and could never really gel with his team.     The undoubted high point was when he inflicted a defeat on Tom Brady. It came in overtime of a Week 7 clash with the Patriots, which is a huge divisional rivalry. Rarely did the Jets beat the Patriots during the TB12 era, so this was a notable moment that made fans hope that Geno could turn things around. It wasn‚Äôt a close contest when it came to the quarterbacks as Geno Smith outperformed his opposite number. Smith threw 33 passes, completing 17 of them for 233 yards and one touchdown. Brady couldn‚Äôt answer this as he was completely shut out in the air, not completing a single TD pass. He threw 46 in total and completed 22 for 228 yards, but threw one interception. 2. Kenny Pickett ‚Äì Pittsburgh Steelers (2022) Kenny Pickett inflicted the first rookie defeat of Brady\'s 2022 season     Kenny Pickett was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers to replace Ben Roethlisberger in the 2022 draft. While he was not an immediate starter for Mike Tomlin, Pickett was in place on the field as the Steelers battled the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 6. With both teams having poor starts, this was a chance for someone to get their season back on track. Nobody expected Pickett to be able to slay the giant that is Tom Brady, but that is exactly what happened as the Bucs offense faltered yet again. The Steelers won 20-18, although Pickett was forced to leave the game with a concussion. Tom Terrific threw 25 completions for 243 yards and scored one touchdown. Pickett was able to throw 18 passes in total with 11 completions. His contribution was only 67 yards, but he threw a touchdown pass which decided the result. It may not have been a complete performance, but Pickett is credited with a rookie win over Tom Brady.     1. Brock Purdy ‚Äì San Francisco 49ers (2022) Brock Purdy may well prove to be the last ever rookie to defeat Tom Brady Perhaps the most dominant victory on this list is also the most recent. Brady had a night to forget against Brock Purdy and the 49ers, with many speculating that the 35-7 win could kickstart Purdy‚Äôs own legend. San Francisco 49ers@49ersRookie and the vet. @brockpurdy13 ü§ù @TomBrady7838960     While this will not be known for a long time, Purdy‚Äôs performance was nevertheless sensational. Of course, he was supported by a strong top-three defense, but still threw 21 passes with 16 completions. His two touchdown passes and tally of 185 yards was enough to emerge comfortably victorious. It would be wrong to say Purdy outclassed Brady because the veteran is playing with a weak offense in 2022, but he still managed to complete 34 of 55 passes for 253 yards. His singular TD pass was the Buccaneers‚Äô only score of the game, as the lack of a running game put too much pressure on the GOAT.Everything Purdy tried came off. It was just one of those magical nights for him, which are rare for rookie quarterbacks.What happens in the rest of his career is unclear, but he will always be able to say that he defeated the legendary Tom Brady in his first ever NFL start. Nobody else can say that.     ']"

He now has 62 wins and 63 losses in 127 games as a quarterback in the NFL (two games finished in a tie). While those numbers may not be awful, Cousins has an awful record in primetime games.

Minnesota will pay Cousins $40 million for the 2022 NFL season, which will likely be his last with the team. The amount of time and money the Vikings have invested in Cousins hasn\'t paid dividends, but he can still prove everyone wrong if he leads them to a Super Bowl win this season.     ', 'Shannon Sharpe blasts Kirk Cousins over yet another Vikings meltdown  Kirk Cousins entered Week 17 of the 2022 NFL season in a key matchup for the outlook of the NFL Playoffs. When the Minnesota Vikings and Green Bay Packers faced off in a high-stakes matchup, serious postseason implications were on the line for both teams. The Vikings are still battling for the number one overall seed in the NFC, while the Packers are trying to earn a Wild Card spot.  Cousins has built a bit of an unfortunate reputation during his career of being a quarterback who often plays his worst brand of football in the biggest moments of the year. This is an accurate description of his performance in Week 17. The Vikings were blown out 41-17, while Kirk Cousins threw three interceptions. He also failed to record a touchdown until the fourth quarter of the game.        Shannon Sharpe recently discussed the poor performance during an episode of Undisputed, saying:           ""I just don\'t have the utmost confidence in Cousins. Because I see a guy that\'s an overachiever, that\'s underconfident. And so you see how Green Bay started to attack him. And so now Jefferson is getting more frustrated, because I\'m not getting the ball. I\'ve gone a whole quarter and I ain\'t got one target. So now they know, and Jaire knows, I got it now. He\'s frustrated. And so even when the ball comes his way, he\'s so focused on beating me, that now he loses concentration.""         Sharpe shredded Kirk Cousins for his disappointing outing in yet another big spot. He also heavily blamed Cousins for his failure to involve Justin Jefferson in the offense, despite being covered by Jaire Alexander. Jefferson was targeted just five times, recording one reception for 15 yards.   Kirk Cousins\' failure to target Justin Jefferson largely contributes to Vikings\' Week 17 loss to Packers Kirk Cousins and Justin Jefferson     Justin Jefferson has recorded 124 receptions on 179 targets for 1,771 yards during the 2022 NFL season. He leads the entire league in all three categories. It\'s inexcusable that Kirk Cousins failed to get him more involved in Week 17. While Jaire Alexander is one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL, the Vikings\' offense is elite when Jefferson plays a major role.     In three of the Vikings\' four losses this year, Jefferson has recorded fewer than 50 receiving yards. They also have an impressive 9-1 record when he accounts for more than six receptions. There is a direct correlation between his production and the Vikings\' results in games this year.     Justin Jefferson can only perform when the quarterback throws him the ball. A huge part of the blame for his disappearance in Week 17 needs to be on Kirk Cousins. It\'s a major factor as to why they were blown away by the Packers.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Undisputed and H/T Sportskeeda.

They've already released Dalvin Cook, and there was talk about the Vikings drafting Hendon Hooker to prepare for life after Kirk Cousins. The franchise, on the other hand, did not do so, and they are committed to Cousins as their quarterback. The 34-year-old quarterback will be a free agent after the upcoming season, and his performance next season will dictate his future in Minnesota. Last season, Cousins had a passer rating of 92.5 with 4,547 yards, 29 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions in 17 games.Justin Jefferson enjoys playing with Kirk Cousins, and the Vikings also drafted Jordan Addison to support the quarterback. It will be interesting to see how the season pans out for the defending NFC North champions.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit I AM HEEM and H/T Sportskeeda.     "", 'NFL analyst claims Kirk Cousins has the most on the line this season - ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no excuses‚Äù  Kirk Cousins finds himself in a familiar situation ahead of the 2023 NFL season. He\'s entering the final year of his current contract once again, as he has done several times during his career. A contract extension with the Minnesota Vikings doesn\'t appear to be imminent during the 2023 NFL offseason, so Cousins will apparently bet on himself once again.  NFL analyst Peter Schrager recently appeared on an episode of ""Good Morning Football"" to discuss Cousins\' potential future in the league:        ""We said that I look like a guy who would be on a yacht. One guy who I know will not be on a yacht, because it\'s just not his style, is Kirk Cousins. And I would say he\'s got the most on the line this year and it\'s because of the contract situation. Basically, he\'s making $35 million this year and he doesn\'t have a year after. This is a free agent. That\'s what it is.""           ""A lot of talk about the Vikings essentially trying to move up, to even number one, early in the draft process. We\'ll get the quarterback in the future, in getting a quarterback in the fifth round named Jaren Hall out of BYU. I know they\'re excited about Jaren Hall, but you know Cousins. It\'s not really \'make or break\' it\'s \'do what you got to do to earn another contract.\' ""     ""Not only with the Vikings but in the league, this guy has made just about as much money as any quarterback in football over the last five to seven years. He\'s got a chance to hit pay dirt again. But I think as far as your legacy, what you\'re known for, Kirk Cousins needs to win a couple more big games. Has to win another playoff game. And I think there\'s no excuses this year as he goes forward with the Minnesota Vikings."" Good Morning Football@gmfbWhich of these primetime teams has the QB with the most on the line this season?11813     While Kirk Cousins put together a relatively strong 2022 NFL season, including helping the Vikings win the NFC North division title, his future still appears to be in serious jeopardy.  This is likely because of his disappointing performance in a loss to the New York Giants during the NFL Playoffs. He will likely need to advance further in the postseason this year if he wants to remain with the Vikings.  What is Kirk Cousins\' career record in the NFL Playoffs?     Kirk Cousins Kirk Cousins began his career with the Washington Commanders. He appeared in two games during the NFL Playoffs, once each in the 2012 and 2015 seasons. He failed to earn a victory in either of his two attempts against the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers.     Cousins earned his first postseason victory as a member of the Minnesota Vikings, defeating the New Orleans Saints in the playoffs for the 2019 season. He lost in the second round against the San Francisco 49ers. During the 2022 NFL season, Cousins made his next appearance, where he was upset by the New York Giants. This brings his career playoff record to a disappointing 1-4 overall.     ', ""NFL fans rip into Kirk Cousins and Jefferson for dismal MNF outing against Eagles  Justin Jefferson, Kirk Cousins and the Minnesota Vikings were riding high after dismantling their divisional rival the Green Bay Packers in Week 1. Jefferson in particular did whatever he wanted, with nine catches for 181 yards and two touchdowns. Coming into their matchup with the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday night, many expected the duo to hook up for big plays once again. Darius Slay and the Eagles, however, had other plans.            Cousins had a particularly bad game, throwing for 221 yards with three interceptions. Jefferson also failed to make his mark, with just six catches for 48 yards on the night.           Slay had two interceptions as the Eagles' secondary completely shut down one of the NFL's most vaunted passing offenses. It was a shocking display on national television that cemented the Eagles as legit contenders. It also raised questions about the Vikings. NFL fans took the opportunity to blast the Vikings and their quarterback and wide receiver duo.

Why were the Eagles able to shut down Justin Jefferson? Minnesota Vikings v Philadelphia Eagles By all accounts, the former LSU product is one of the best wide receivers in the NFL. He's produced like not many others have and routinely makes opposing defenses look silly. That's exactly what he did against the Packers, running wild all day en route to a career day. The Packers have a highly rated defense, so why weren't they able to stop the Vikings wide receiver?     There are a lot of stipulations to consider when evaluating an individual game's performance, so there's no clear answer. But there is one big reason why Jefferson ran wild last week and didn't get anything here: the opposing corner. Minnesota Vikings v Philadelphia Eagles Both Slay and Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander are among the league's best, but only one of them spent a lot of time on the Vikings star. Alexander expressed his confusion after the game last week as to why he wasn't guarding Jefferson.     Slay guarded him most of the night and pretty much shut him down. Having an elite cornerback shadow the best receiver can be a recipe for success, as it was for the Eagles last night.   The Vikings offense, especially their stud wide receiver, will be fine, but the Eagles might have given other teams a look at how to defend them better. We will see if that's the case when the Vikings welcome the Lions in Week 3.     "", ""NFL fans have wild reactions to Taylor Heinicke hopping on the Kirk Cousins trend  The Washington Commanders, led by backup quarterback Taylor Heinicke, pulled off what may be the biggest upset of the NFL season on Monday night. They defeated the then-unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles by a score of 32-21.  As started by Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, it's become a trend for players to don large chains and celebrate on the team plane after big wins. Heinicke continued that trend on Monday after the Commanders' huge victory.

Who should start: Taylor Heinicke or Carson Wentz? There's no denying that Wentz has talent. His 2017 season was incredible and he has shown flashes of brilliance ever since. The biggest issue with him is inconsistency. Washington Commanders v Philadelphia Eagles Sometimes, he makes tremendous throws and incredibly athletic plays. He sometimes throws the ball directly at defenders too. Wentz can show why he was selected second overall in one play and then follow it up with a huge mistake.        His backup doesn't seem to have the highs and lows that Wentz does. He may not be capable of making some of the plays that Wentz is, but he's also not going to make as many errors, either. Commanders head coach Ron Rivera has thrown Wentz under the bus once before this season. He will have a decision to make in the near future.   The Commanders have played fairly well with their backup, but he's the backup for a reason. It will be interesting to see where they are in the standings when Wentz returns and who they decide to start then on. If Taylor Heinicke continues to win games, there's a good chance he will get the nod.     "", ""Why Kirk Cousins is the worst kind of QB in the NFL?\xa0  Kirk Cousins' stats during the previous NFL season read as follows; 4,265 yards, 68% completion percentage, 35 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. These are impressive stats but they do not match the eye test. If you watched the Minnesota Vikings play last season, you experienced one of the most frustrating QB seasons in recent memory.  The harsh truth about Kirk Cousins:        Minnesota Vikings v Green Bay Packers           The Minnesota Vikings and Kirk Cousins lost their opening game to the Green Bay Packers in embarrassing fashion. The score at the end of the 3rd quarter was 29 - 10 and this game summed up Kirk Cousins completely as he was 19 for 25 (76%), threw for 259 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. One must ask how can your QB be so excellent and yet you are completely out of the game? No position in the NFL has a higher say over the proceedings of a game than the quarterback. It is here, where Kirk Cousins suffers, that he does not seem capable of bending games to his will.     The game was eye-opening because the gentleman wearing the No.12 on the other team is maybe the greatest-ever at influencing games. Aaron Rodgers ended the 1st quarter down 7 - 3, and in the very next quarter, Green Bay dropped 19 points. There was a safety on Kirk Cousins to open the quarter, Green Bay made a field goal and Rodgers threw two touchdowns to will his offense to life and the half ended 22 to 10. If Cousins was an elite quarterback, this was the moment to prove it, and Cousins was home to boot. Unfortunately, the Minnesota Vikings scored 0 3rd quarter points as the game got away from them while in the 4th quarter in pure garbage time Kirk Cousins threw his only two touchdowns of the game and collected empty meaningless stats which add up to his impressive but meaningless passing stats. So, what is up with Kirk Cousins? Minnesota Vikings v Detroit Lions     Coach Mike Zimmer should‚Äôve suspended those fully-guaranteed checks after such an abysmal performance at home. It was so frustrating that this is how the majority of Viking games went; Kirk Cousins being terrible for long stretches before ultimately cleaning up his stat line in garbage time. Let‚Äôs compare him with Rodgers again to see the difference between a false image and an actual HOF QB. Cousins threw for 35 touchdowns last season, but 25 of his 35 TDs (71% of his TDs) came in the 2nd half, Rodgers in comparison threw for 48 touchdowns but 34 of those 48 (71% as well) came in the first half as well. That‚Äôs the difference between a QB who can impose his will on proceedings and one who is a passenger. This is fine majority of QB‚Äôs are passengers only an elite few can takeover games by themselves but the problem is Cousins is being paid like he is one of those QB‚Äôs when he is clearly not. The Vikings have invested in Cousins to be a franchise QB and last season was the confirmation that they made a horrible mistake. Russell Wilson has had a bad o-line for numerous years but he always overcame it, Brady had no weapons during his last season at New England but they still won 12 games, Big Ben‚Äôs arm is completely shot but he still commands more fear than Kirk Cousins and that‚Äôs just absurd.     End of 3rd Quarter scores of all Minnesota Viking games: Vikings 10 - 29 Packers. Colts 18 - 3 Vikings. Vikings 24 - 25 Titans. Vikings 24 - 16 Texans. Seahawks 21 - 19 Vikings. Vikings 7 - 30 Falcons. Packers 14 - 28 Vikings. Vikings 27 - 10 Lions. Bears 13 - 13 Vikings. Vikings 14 - 16 Cowboys. Vikings 10 - 21 Panthers. Vikings 19 - 16 Jaguars. Buccaneers 23 - 14 Vikings. Vikings 20 - 27 Bears. Saints 31 - 27 Vikings. Lions 29 - 31 Vikings. Two clear patterns emerge: First, Mike Zimmer's defense was disappointing and second the Vikings were usually down big or real close going into the 4th quarter. To be fair to Kirk Cousins, playing QB in the NFL is one of the most difficult jobs in the world. A QB must read, process and react all in about 2 to 5 seconds but Cousins must be held accountable for his disappointing play. Going into 4th quarters tied or slightly down places the game solely in your QB‚Äôs hand and Kirk Cousins has let Vikings fans down too many times for them to place any trust in him.

Kirk Cousins cannot inflict his will on games and thus cannot elevate what‚Äôs around him. Most fans would rather go 1 - 15 and draft a QB capable of influencing games than continue on with just an above-average QB who is a passenger.

"", ""Five NFL quarterbacks who will hit free agency in 2024 feat. Kirk Cousins  In the generation where quarterbacks' yearly wages are an all-time high, some NFL teams have to bite the bullet to stay competitive. Some NFL teams panic and think about security rather than ability and some bring in QB's as depth or leaders to young team-mate quarterbacks. Let's take a look at five free agents for 2024 and what their fate might be.  #1 - Kirk Cousins        Kirk Cousins is, by far, the most expensive quarterback on this list. Cousins is guaranteed to earn $35 million in 2023. This comes off the back of signing a three-year, $84 million deal in 2018, followed by a two-year, $66 million deal. Cousins has led the Vikings to the playoffs twice in 2019 and 2022. The Vikings pulled off a win in the 2019 divisional round after a game-winning drive led by Cousins in overtime, before getting run all over by the 49ers the next week.           Cousins had good seasons in 2020 and 2021 but missed the playoffs in both of those years. The Vikings rebounded in 2022 making the playoffs, but Cousins and Co. crumbled in their first playoff game against the Giants. The Vikings selected QB Jaren Hall in the fifth round of the 2023 draft. He is probably not their next franchise quarterback, but his selection shows they are ready for a change at the position. There is no world where Cousins returns to the Vikings after the 2023 season.     #2 - Ryan Tannehill Tennessee Titans v Los Angeles Chargers The Titans made their plans clear in the 2022 draft, selecting QB Will Levis in the second round. Tannehill is guaranteed $29.5 million in 2023. Tannehill only played 12 games last season and missed the win and in game against the Jaguars in Week 18. As a result of the loss, the Titans missed the playoffs after going one and done as the one seed the previous year. With the Titans' new stadium being approved, it's clear Ryan Tannehill will never play there as a Titans QB. Will Levis will be the starting quarterback for the Titans in 2024 for sure. However, a change mid-season can't be ruled out whether for a Tannehill injury or poor performance.     #3 - Mitchell Trubisky Pittsburgh Steelers v Baltimore Ravens The cult hero signed with the Steelers in 2022 and became their starter after Big Ben's retirement. Meanwhile, rookie QB Kenny Pickett would sit for a year and learn. However, that is not how things played out. Trubisky exited the fourth game of the season due to injury. He would feature in a win over Tampa Bay and games against Baltimore and Carolina, but Pickett is the man going forward in Pittsburgh.     Trubisky will have to sit behind Pickett in 2023. Trubisky's only hope of playing is if Pickett gets injured along the way. Trubisky will take his guaranteed $7 million dollars and will have to look for a new team in 2024. #4 - Marcus Mariota Pittsburgh Steelers v Atlanta Falcons Mariota was a starter in 2023 with a Falcons offense well suited to him. The team drew up a lot of handoffs to running backs and QB run plays for Mariota. An ok season for Mariota was tampered with because he missed the final four games due to injury, and rookie QB Desmond Ridder played in Mariota's place.     Arthur Smith confirmed in the 2023 off-season Ridder would be the starting QB for the Falcons in 2023, which enabled Mariota to move to the Eagles during the 2023 free agency period to serve as backup to Jalen Hurts. Mariota is well suited to the Eagles' offensive scheme but so is newly-paid Jalen Hurts. Mariota may play if Hurts gets injured in 2023. At $5 million guaranteed and a scheme fit, I think the Eagles will keep Mariota as backup past 2023. #5 - Nick Foles Super Bowl LII - Philadelphia Eagles v New England Patriots     The only quarterback of these five to lead a team to a Super Bowl win, Foles will always be a legend in Philadelphia. The Eagles QB almost did it again in 2018, when the team was moments away from going to the NFC Championship game. Foles had two irrelevant years in 2020 and 2021 with the Jaguars and Bears. Foles signed for the Colts in 2022.Foles only played two games in 2022 behind Matt Ryan. The Colts selected QB Anthony Richardson with the fourth pick of the 2023 draft. This allows Nick Foles to take his guaranteed $3 million dollars and either find another team or head to retirement as a Super Bowl winner and Super Bowl MVP.     ""]"
50,Mason Rudolph,"[""NFL: 5 best replacements for Ben Roethlisberger at the Pittsburgh Steelers\xa0  Earlier during the offseason, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger restructured his contract to help with his team's cap situation.  In doing so, Roethlisberger also ensured he'll be returning to the fold in the Steel City come September 9th as the starting quarterback. But after 16 fantastic years in the NFL, it's hard to imagine that Roethlisberger has too many more championship-caliber years left in him.        Currently, Mason Rudolph is the Steelers' backup quarterback. If you happened to catch his 2019 performances when filling in for the injured Roethlisberger, then you'll already know they fell beneath the high standards expected in Pittsburgh.           The experience may have aided his progression. But, personally, I don't think Rudolph is the solution in the long term. This of course begs the question of who Roethlisberger's successor will eventually be? Let's take a look. Five potential replacements for Ben Roethlisberger The Steelers have signed Ben Roethlisberger to a new contract, per @RapSheet 24th highest-graded QB in 2020 (69.0) pic.twitter.com/DQMUUJ4mEK‚Äî PFF (@PFF) March 4, 2021     #1 - Marcus Mariota (Las Vegas Raiders) Marcus Mariota 2014 Heisman Award-winning QB Marcus Mariota has struggled to live up to expectations in his NFL career. In Tennessee, his abilities seemed to wane year on year and it was no surprise to see him moved on to the Las Vegas Raiders during the 2020 offseason. Mariota has been back up to Derek Carr ever since. That being said, there are two reasons why this signing could work for the Steelers. First, Mariota is out of contract at the end of the 2021 season and has enough experience under his belt to come in and do a job and second, in the one-game viewers really got to see off Mariota last season, he performed quite well.         This performance does suggest that coach Gruden's influence on one of the best college players of all time has been paying off. Besides which, if all else fails, Mariota can simply keep the passing game simple and hand the ball off to Najee Harris, who looks destined to have a tremendous career in the NFL. #2 - Carson Strong (Nevada)        Of all the quarterbacks I've seen this week in preparation for next year's 2022 NFL draft, the Nevada Wolf Pack's signal-caller Carson Strong is certainly the closest to Roethlisberger's style of play. He is potentially a college talent that the Steelers will keep an eye on. Like Roethlisberger, Strong is a traditional pocket-passer blessed with a gun of an arm, accurate delivery, and, at 6-foot-4, a real presence behind the line. Of course, the Steelers could vouch for a host of other quarterbacks in next year's draft. But with 5,193 yards, 38 TDs and just 11 picks in his first two campaigns as a starter in Nevada, Mike Tomlin and co. could do a lot worse than Carson Strong in their quest to replace Roethlisberger. #3 - Drew Lock or Teddy Bridgewater (Denver Broncos) Denver Broncos v Atlanta Falcons     With Drew Lock now vying with the former-Panther, Teddy Bridgewater, for quarterback supremacy in Denver. One of the two signal-callers will likely be deemed surplus to requirements come the 2022 offseason. Teddy Bridgewater threw for 3,733 passing yards, 15 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for Carolina in 2020. Drew Lock managed 2,933 passing yards, 16 touchdowns and 15 picks for the Broncos. With those stats, neither player is likely to pacify a Steelers fanbase used to watching such talents as Terry Bradshaw and Ben Roethlisberger at Heinz Field. But both would be decent stop-gap options if coach Tomlin and GM Kevin Colbert feel there isn't value for them in the 2022 NFL draft. #4 - Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers) Aaron Rodgers is reportedly not happy with the Packers and he has told the organization he does not want to return to the team, per @AdamSchefter Rodgers: PFF's highest-graded player in 2020 (95.1) pic.twitter.com/xTHVEAlZBF‚Äî PFF (@PFF) April 29, 2021     Aaron Rodgers wants out of Green Bay. The Pittsburgh Steelers franchise is one of the most renowned and storied in sports. If the quarterback is granted his wish, I'd expect to see the Steelers sniffing around for the 2020 NFL MVP and the quarterback reciprocating the interest. It probably won't happen, but the Steelers have as good a chance as any other team of persuading Rodgers to join their ranks and, of course, he'd be an excellent replacement for Roethlisberger. #5 - Mitchell Trubisky (Buffalo Bills) Mitchell Trubisky: 63.5 PFF Grade in 2020T-32nd among QBs pic.twitter.com/6eOYBFqsJ6‚Äî PFF (@PFF) March 18, 2021     Bear with me here. For all the hate he receives for not being Patrick Mahomes, Mitchell Trubisky has still thrown almost twice as many touchdowns as he has interceptions in his short career. He's been to the playoffs twice and he's young enough to improve further whilst learning a more dynamic style of offense under Sean McDermott and Brian Daboll at the Bills training center. And who knows what kind of tricks he'll pick up from Josh Allen over in Buffalo, too. Like my first pick Marcus Mariota, I just don't think Trubisky is over and done with in the NFL just yet. Someone will give him another opportunity, so why not the Steelers next year if Roethlisberger retires?Trubisky lining up alongside RB Najee Harris, WRs JuJu Smith-Schuster, Chase Claypool and Diontae Johnson doesn't sound all that bad to me.Plus, it's not like Roethlisberger didn't have a nightmare season back in 2006 (18 touchdowns, 23 interceptions). Players can improve, and Trubisky deserves another shot.     Also Read: Who is Ben Roethlisberger's Wife, Ashley Harlan?

However, there are still three NFL teams that don\'t have an official QB1 for the 2021 season and five others are still figuring out their QB2.           Below, we project the winners of a few quarterback battles. Projected winners for top QB battles in the NFL  #1 New England Patriots - Mac Jones, QB1 Mac Jones on a frozen rope üöÄ pic.twitter.com/rOiDECIg0t‚Äî PFF (@PFF) August 20, 2021 This is probably the most straightforward prediction after recent events.  A miscommunication led to Cam Newton violating the NFL\'s health and safety protocol and the veteran will now miss most of this week\'s practices ahead of the preseason finale.      Rookie Mac Jones will take this opportunity to solidify his case for the starting job further and win it with a good outing in the Patriots\' NFL preseason finale against the New York Giants.  #2 New Orleans Saints - Jameis Winston, QB1 SLING DAT THING @Jaboowins! üí™29-yard TD strike to @CallawayMarquez üôåüì∫: ESPN pic.twitter.com/SPBZczDB1b‚Äî New Orleans Saints (@Saints) August 24, 2021 The battle between Jameis Winston and Taysom Hill has gone on longer than expected, but the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback is finally starting to pull ahead.  Winston is playing with confidence and has been efficient while leading the offense during the preseason. The former number one overall pick already had the advantage due to his history of putting up big passing numbers.      With Winston as the starter, Taysom Hill can still carve out a specialty role to get game time.  #3 San Francisco 49ers - Jimmy Garoppolo, QB1 Jimmy Garoppolo has ‚Äúa pretty good idea‚Äù of who‚Äôs starting for the #49ers Week 1. This is the unbothered answer of a man who spends zero time on Twitter. pic.twitter.com/2KT366w4L5‚Äî Lydia (@limajuliettango) August 25, 2021 Trey Lance might be the better NFL quarterback prospect, but the San Francisco 49ers have over $20 million invested in Jimmy Garoppolo this year and he\'s more experienced.  That\'s not to say the 49ers can\'t make a change later in the season if they are eliminated from playoff contention, or Garoppolo struggles or gets injured. The best-case scenario is to put Lance in before the NFL trade deadline if he\'s still the better player and trade Garoppolo to a needy team.     #4 Pittsburgh Steelers - Mason Rudolph, QB2  A very underrated play of the night here from Mason Rudolph. Free rusher in his face, avoids the sack and has great awareness to try and fight to move the chains. Take your hat off and hand it to 2 here, with some help from Finney and Green. I loved this. #Steelers pic.twitter.com/3QsOiUGJ3z‚Äî Josh Carney (@ByJoshCarney) August 22, 2021 Dwayne Haskins was announced as the Steelers\' NFL preseason finale starter, meaning Mason Rudolph will be the backup to Ben Roethlisberger this year.  Haskins still has to beat Joshua Dobbs for a roster spot, which should be easy if he plays well against the Carolina Panthers\' starting defense. This year, Haskins had a solid shot at winning QB2, but Rudolph\'s strong NFL preseason performances seem to have won him the battle.     #5 Dallas Cowboys - Cooper Rush, QB2 Head coach Mike McCarthy confirmed it will be Cooper Rush taking the first-team reps at quarterback during today\'s press conference.üó£Ô∏è ""He has earned this opportunity, absolutely."" üó£Ô∏è‚Äî Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) August 23, 2021 In a surprising turn of events, Cooper Rush quietly climbed the depth chart during the NFL preseason and is in line to be the Dallas Cowboys\' backup quarterback for the 2021 season.  Garrett Gilbert entered camp as Dak Prescott\'s backup but had a disastrous outing against the Houston Texans. Rush went 25-of-38 for 256 yards and two touchdowns in preseason action. Between Rush and Gilbert, the former looked like the better NFL quarterback under pressure and proved he can lead the offense down the field. Rush was the Cowboys\' backup quarterback from 2017-2019 before Andy Dalton took over in 2020 but earned his spot back.     ', ""Zurich Classic: Where is the Zurich Classic of New Orleans held?

Somehow 10 wide receivers were taken before him.  Before the draft, Pickens was viewed as a first-round talent, but slid due to medical concerns and off-field behavior. He played in only the final four games of college football last year, catching just five passes. But he recorded a 52-yard reception in Georgia's win over Alabama in the National Championship.                     One of Pickens' best attributes coming out of college was his physicality. The 6'3 200 pound receiver isn't afraid of contact and is very good at run-blocking. Pickens made his debut as the Pittsburgh Steelers faced the Seattle Seahawks in the preseason. In the first quarter of last night's contest, Pickens wowed people with a physical block he made. He pancaked a Seattle defender with ease. The block was very reminiscent of Steelers legend Hines Ward. Warren Sharp@SharpFootballGeorge Pickens picking up right where he left off22716     There were some concerns about Pickens coming out of college due to him tearing his ACL in the spring of 2021. There were also concerns about his behavior becoming an issue in an NFL locker room. That's why he slid to the Steelers in the second-round. Also Checkout:- Steelers Preseason Schedule NFL preseason highlights - George Pickens steals the show with incredible toe drag Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Seattle Seahawks     The George Pickens secret is out now. He proved why he might be one of the best wide receivers to come out of this year's draft class.In his preseason matchup he had five total targets with three receptions for 43 yards. The highlight of the game came when he hauled in an incredible toe-dragging reception in the corner of the endzone, thrown by Mason Rudolph. B/R Gridiron@brgridironGeorge Pickens with the toe-tap TD  (via @steelers)4145414 The Steelers are known for drafting receivers in the mid-rounds and devolping them into superstars. We've seen them develop Diontae Johnson, JuJu Smith-Schuster, Chase Claypool, Antonio Brown, and many others.     Pickens is the newest of their receivers and has the potential to be one of the best in his position in a few years' time.   Rookie first-round quarterback Kenny Pickett also had himself a performance for the Steelers. He completed 13 out of 15 passes and recorded over 120 total yards and 2 touchdowns. Things are looking bright for the future of Pittsburgh.     "", 'Pittsburgh Steelers schedule 2022: opponents and win-loss predictions  The Pittsburgh Steelers are entering their first season of the post-Ben Roethlisberger era. He has been a main-stay in their offense since the 2003 season and it will be bizarre to see someone else under center.  There was a period in the 2019 season when Mason Rudolph filled in for \'Big Ben\' while he recovered from reconstructive surgery and it did not go so well. The Steelers struggled as Rudolph threw for 1765 yards, 13 touchdowns and nine interceptions in 10 appearances. He was benched during the season for Devin ""Duck"" Hodges, who also struggled.        The \'Steel City\' is now living in a new era, and there could be bumps in the road as it figures out who will be their franchise quarterback.              There are three options currently available, all with question marks against their names. Rudolph is one option. Though he previously struggled, he knows the playbook and the offense and has had years to develop. However, he is the least likely to be the starter at this moment in time.     Another option is Kenny Pickett, the No. 20 pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. He looked like a superstar at Pitt, where he was named the ACC Player of the Year for the conference champion Panthers. His biggest issue is with his hand-size, though you can ask Mike Vick how much that matters in the grand scheme.    Mitch Trubisky is the third option and it is expected that he or Pickett will get the starting role. The second overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft went 4-8 in his 2018 rookie season for the Chicago Bears, throwing as many touchdown passes (seven) as he had interceptions.     That said, he has a winning record since and has played like a middle-of-the-road starter, if not better.

The Bengals swept the Steelers last season, one of those games finishing 41-10. Pittsburgh fans might suffer a similar fate if they don\'t start fast on offense. Daniel Valente@StatsGuyDanielThere‚Äôs no better way for the Steelers to make a statement than to go into the home of the reigning AFC champs and win Week 1. Especially after the Bengals outscored you 65-20 last year.Would also be a great way to kick off the Kenny Pickett era, if he wins the starting job.15012 Week 2: vs. New England Patriots     Prediction: W The Steelers will open up their home slate with a win against the New England Patriots. The Steelers defense will prove to be too much for Mac Jones to handle as he tries to replicate his rookie season production. Week 3: at Cleveland Browns Prediction: W If Jacoby Brissett is under center when Pittsburgh visit Cleveland for their Thursday Night Football matchup, this could be a footing-establishing victory. If Deshaun Watson is there it will be a different game indeed, but the Steelers have had a lot of success in Cleveland historically. Week 4: vs. New York Jets Prediction: W New York will be better in 2022 than in previous years, but they won\'t be ready to march into the \'Steel City\' and hang a loss on this defense. Zach Wilson could be in for a very stressful day. Week 5: at Buffalo Bills Prediction: L The Bills will welcome Pittsburgh and be ready to knock the Steelers off their 3-1 perch. Sadly, they may smack some reality into a team that could be riding the highs of an early-season winning streak.     Week 6: vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Prediction: L Things will really start to even out for Pittsburgh when Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers come to town. This time, not for a classic quarterback duel with his old opponent Ben Roethlisberger, but instead to dishearten whichever signal caller is starting for the black and yellow. Week 7: at Dolphins Prediction: L Gone will be the good vibes of the earlier three-game winning streak, as the Steelers lose on Sunday Night Football to the Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium. Week 8: at Eagles Prediction: L The in-state rivalry between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia will result in a fourth straight loss for the AFC counterpart, who will be limping into the bye week on a heavy losing streak. Week 9: BYE Week 10: vs. New Orleans Saints Prediction: W Pittsburgh\'s bye week will work wonders for a franchise in need of a turnaround, setting them up for success against the New Orleans Saints in a borderline must-win scenario.     Week 11: vs. Cincinnati Bengals Prediction: L On Sunday Night Football, the Steelers will suffer a second loss of the season to the Bengals, knocking Pittsburgh down the standings to an unenviable 4-6. Week 12: at Indianapolis Colts Prediction: W Perhaps counted out as an underdog unlikely to remain in the postseason mix, Pittsburgh will surprise the Colts at Lucas Oil Stadium and pick up a much-needed victory in the AFC playoff picture. Week 13: at Atlanta Falcons Prediction: W Momentum will be tangible for the Steelers when they travel south to Atlanta to pick off a Falcons squad that isn\'t destined to do much during the 2022 season. Weel 14: vs. Baltimore Ravens Prediction: W In what will be one of the season\'s signature victories for whoever is under center, the Steelers will surprise a likely favored Ravens when they play host to Baltimore Week 14. Expect to see the Steelers pass rush looking dominant and a few turnovers gifted from a harried Lamar Jackson.     Week 15: at Carolina Panthers Prediction: W There\'s a good chance the Carolina Panthers will end up right where they were during the 2022 NFL Draft: armed with a top-six pick. Pittsburgh will be one of the many losses dictating why that will be. Week 16: vs. Las Vegas Raiders Prediction: L This Saturday Night Football affair has every opportunity to deliver late-season fireworks, but the Raiders should be in a more desperate position to win given the competitiveness of their division and probably have too much firepower for Pittsburgh. Week 17: at Baltimore Ravens Prediction: L The Ravens will get their revenge for a prior Week 14 loss and make the AFC North battle an interesting one down the stretch if the Cincinnati Bengals don\'t run away with the division. Week 18: vs. Cleveland Browns Prediction: L Deshaun Watson could be back in the mix as the season reaches its conclusion. This could include several big performances to leave Browns fans happy after potentially missing the postseason due to his delayed debut. Pittsburgh will finish with a losing record for the first time since before they drafted Ben Roethlisberger in 2003.     Pittsburgh Steelers record prediction: 8-9 While many of these games could go either way, it is probable Pittsburgh will struggle this season. They have not been lights out on offense for a few seasons and there is a danger this could continue this year. If the starting quarterback stutters under center, there may be a change at quarterback, which could go one of two ways.     ', '5 takeaways from Pittsburgh Steelers win over Dallas Cowboys in Hall of Fame game  The first game of the 2021 NFL preseason saw the Pittsburgh Steelers defeat the Dallas Cowboys 16-3. Preseason games won\'t have much bearing on things to come, but fans did get a good look at both teams\' roster depth.  Both the Steelers and Cowboys will play four preseason games as opposed to three like the rest of the teams in the league and will likely use it to assess their roster ahead of the new season. Here are some of the main takeaways from the contest.        Five takeaways from Dallas Cowboys vs. Pittsburgh Steelers           #1 - MVP players from each team Neither Ben Roethlisberger nor Dak Prescott played tonight. The teams also did not field many starters. This gave the opportunity to the teams\' depth players to showcase their talent. OUR BALL!@_jlayne with the strip, @TwanDoee with the pickupüì∫: FOX | üì±: https://t.co/2cNCfRoIM1 pic.twitter.com/in3NIMstjm‚Äî Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) August 6, 2021 For the Dallas Cowboys, rookie linebacker Micah Parsons and 2018 UDFA WR Malik Turner delivered strong performances. Parsons had only three tackles in the game but was all over the field and seemed involved in most of the big tackles. After the game. Parsons said:     ""It was bittersweet that I didn\'t get to play a lot... I am going to build off of it."" Malik Turner seemed to be the favorite target of every Dallas quarterback that played in the game. He finished with four catches on six targets for 47 yards. However, Turner fumbled the ball after completing a big pass on a 4th-and-15, which the Pittsburgh Steelers recovered. The Steelers\' MVPs include punter Pressley Harvin lll and RB Kalen Ballage. Harvin might have already won the position battle after just four punts. He averaged 45.8 yards per punt. Harvin had an excellent deep punt on his first attempt, his second one was downed at the Cowboys\' 1-yard line, his third pinned Dallas inside the 10, and his last one was muffled and recovered by the Steelers. Kalen Ballage didn\'t lead the team in touches or yards but did score the game\'s first touchdown. He is a powerful runner who should get more touches during preseason. He will likely win the battle against Jaylen Samuels for a roster spot.     #2 - Players who might already be out of roster spot contention ""We\'ve had a kick made... we\'ve had a kick made."" - Joe Buck Sam Sloman hits a 48-yarder. pic.twitter.com/a2BLolztPe‚Äî Justin Groc (@jgroc) August 6, 2021 This is the first time coaches are getting an objective look at their players in action on the field this year. Some players had poor outings and it might have already put them on the chopping block. For Dallas, that could be quarterback Ben DiNucci and kicker Hunter Niswander. DiNucci played most of the game and ended with 89 passing yards, an interception, and two sacks. His QB rating was 33.7. He made some nice plays on the final drive of the game and showed he could make plays on the run. Overall, DiNucci didn\'t make the best decisions in the pocket. His accuracy was shaky.     Hunter Niswander made his first attempt from 29 yards out. He had another 29-yard field goal attempt blocked by the Pittsburgh Steelers and missed wildly on a 52-yard kick.  For the Pittsburgh Steelers, kicker Sam Sloman and RB Jaylen Samuels are early candidates on the roster bubble. It wasn\'t a good night for kickers. Sloman missed wide right on his first kick from 49 yards, missed his first XP attempt, but nailed a 48-yard FG and his second XP attempt.  Jaylen Samuels led the Pittsburgh Steelers with the most carries with 11 but only mustered 20 yards and 1.8 per carry. Samuels is battling Ballage for a roster spot but struggled to burst through holes the entire game. #3 - Dallas has found their QB2 while Pittsburgh is still in a heated battle Good QB-WR timing right here.@josh_dobbs1 finds @TySimmons_3 for six!üì∫: @ProFootballHOF Game on FOX pic.twitter.com/qTbXaG4oEQ‚Äî NFL (@NFL) August 6, 2021     Quarterback Garrett Gilbert will likely be Dak Prescott\'s backup going into the season. He made a few mental mistakes early in the game but was solid otherwise. He threw for 104 yards in a minimal role against a relatively solid Pittsburgh Steelers secondary. The Pittsburgh Steelers went in with Mason Rudolph as their QB2, but now all three QBs are still in the hunt. Rudolph played for a short time and was somewhat effective with the ball, completing his first five passes. Dwayne Haskins showed he can lead the offense down the field on several occasions and had decent downfield accuracy. Josh Dobbs threw the only touchdown pass of the game and looked like a true field general. Any of the three could win the backup quarterback role for the Pittsburgh Steelers. #4 - Strong performances from position players  The Pittsburgh defense came to play tonight üí™üò§(via @steelers) pic.twitter.com/mmULJBbZqj‚Äî FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) August 6, 2021     Dallas may have found solid depth players at wide receiver and running back. Malik Turner was one of the MVPs for the Cowboys, while Adam Parker and Cedrick Wilson found themselves open more than a few times and made some big plays. Rico Dowdle led the team with eight carries and 43 yards. JaQuan Hardy and Tony Pollard had some success, but fullback Sewo Olonilua was a star in picking up blitzes all game long. The secondary and EDGE were the positives for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Donovan Stiner got out in front of the route to snag the only interception of the game. James Pierre was likely the best defender throughout the game in man coverage. Miles Killebrew had a great game with six tackles and Mark Gilbert broke up a few key passes. Rookie Quincy Roche and Alex Highsmith both notched a sack and Highsmith was constantly putting pressure on Dallas and knocking down the quarterbacks. The Pittsburgh Steelers defense should be better down the stretch this year.     #5 - Reviews for both teams Rookie @MicahhParsons11 is a football magnet. Fumble recovery! @dallascowboys üì∫: @ProFootballHOF Game on FOX pic.twitter.com/MHOQDh1MlK‚Äî NFL (@NFL) August 6, 2021 The Dallas Cowboys are loaded with stellar players on defense, but there isn\'t much depth at this point. That\'s not to say they cannot build that as the preseason goes on. After all, this was most of the players\' taste of NFL action. They are deep at wide receiver and rookie Micah Parsons is poised to have an excellent rookie season. The Pittsburgh Steelers still have several key positions to figure out. They found a gem in the seventh-round in punter Pressley Harvin and their secondary has more depth and talent than expected going into the game.     The front seven applied consistent pressure and heat on the Dallas O-line and ran the game, which bodes well entering the season. Wide receiver Chase Claypool was great in the first quarter. The highlight was his diving catch that looked spectacular but also caused some damage to his shoulder. Wide receiver James Washington also had a promising outing.There\'s a chance Mason Rudolph won\'t end up as the backup after all, as both Dwayne Haskins and Josh Dobbs played well.     ', 'Jimmy Garoppolo could make these 3 teams contenders  Considering Jimmy Garoppolo‚Äôs stellar resume, his availability on the open market is likely to be short lived. While Garoppolo has done his best to win the San Francisco 49ers the Super Bowl, he came up short against the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2019 season. Just this past season, Garoppolo was only one offensive drive away from leading the 49ers back to the Super Bowl. Unfortunately for them, they lost to the Los Angeles Rams.  With the franchise moving forward with sophomore quarterback Trey Lance, Jimmy Garoppolo has become expendable. Several teams have expressed an interest in the quarterback, and at some point, a franchise will come for him. By and large, his game isn‚Äôt flashy or highlight reel worthy. But that said, Jimmy Garoppoo wins games and there are many teams who could use this trait.        His next destination is currently unknown, but here are three teams that could turn themselves into Super Bowl contenders with his help.           #1- Miami Dolphins   The Miami Dolphins continue to exhibit patience when it comes to Tua Tagovailoa. Through two fairly disappointing seasons, Tagovailoa‚Äôs shine has dimmed considerably. Yet, as the franchise pondered long and hard over his future, they decided against getting rid of him. Instead, Miami doubled down, getting their hands on dynamic wide receiver Tyreek Hill. Still, even with Hill creating space for his quarterback, Tagovailoa might fail in 2023.        In back-to-back seasons, Tagovailoa has been castigated for his unwillingness to launch the ball down the field. This is despite having ample opportunities to do so. Tagovailoa, thus far, has failed to throw for more than seven yards per attempt. He finished his first season in the league with 6.3 and his sophomore campaign with 6.8. Although age is still on Tagovailoa‚Äôs side, time might not be. Miami might well look to unload him in favor of Jimmy Garoppolo.     Heavily criticized for his injury woes, Jimmy Garoppolo played in all 16 of the San Francisco 49ers games in 2019. He played in 15 of their 17 games this past season. When healthy, he is one of the best deep-ball passers in the league. In 2021, he threw for 3,810 yards, at 8.6 yards per attempt. Jimmy Garoppolo is a proven winner. He‚Äôs won 33 of his 47 total starts and has led the 49ers to at least the NFC Championship Game in two of the past three seasons. For a franchise hungry for relevance, he could be a tempting target. #2- Pittsburgh Steelers AFC Wild Card Playoffs - Pittsburgh Steelers v Kansas City Chiefs     Life without quarterback Ben Roethlisberger won‚Äôt be pretty for the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was pretty rough over his last 24 games. They were 11-0 in 2020, but the Steelers have managed a 9-14-1 record since (including two postseason losses). Roethlisberger retired following a heavy Wild Card defeat against the Kansas City Chiefs this past season. Currently, Mitch Trubisky, Mason Rudolph, and the newly drafted Kenny Pickett are all battling it out to win the starting job. Regardless of whoever is chosen, the Steelers will struggle on offense this season.        Rudolph, a former third-round selection in the 2019 NFL Draft, has languished listlessly on the Steelers bench for the past three seasons. When he covered for an injured Roethlisberger, he did not inspire confidence. Rudolph was benched for Devlin ""Duck"" Hodges, who fared no better. Trubisky, on the other hand, enters camp with a bit of an edge over his younger counterparts. Although categorized as a bust, Trubisky has enjoyed moments of success. Trubisky played a major role in pushing the Chicago Bears to prominence, including in 2018, when he made a Pro Bowl appearance. With one of the most explosive defenses in the NFL, spearheaded by T.J. Watt, Pittsburgh are in need of some offensive firepower. Even the best defense will falter if it stays on the field all game, something the Steelers have noted over the last two years. While Garoppolo hasn‚Äôt wowed in terms of his overall production, he does bring consistent performances. He can utilize the best options available, presuming the offensive line will allow him. This was an issue for the Steelers in 2021.     Jimmy Garoppolo\'s winning pedigree may also be too tempting to turn down for the Steelers. Much like his ability to win in the postseason. In two of his three seasons donning a San Francisco 49ers jersey, Garoppolo has led them to at least the NFC Championship Game.  #3- Tennessee Titans AFC Divisional Playoffs - Cincinnati Bengals v Tennessee Titans On paper, comparing the careers of Jimmy Garoppolo and Ryan Tannehill yields unexpected results. Tannehill, the current Tennessee Titans quarterback, has aggregated two seasons of at least 4,000 passing yards. He was also named to the Pro Bowl roster in 2019. Jimmy Garoppolo, on the other hand, is yet to make a Pro Bowl and is viewed as a very conservative thrower of the football.     Yet apprehension sweeps over the Tennessee Titans fanbase when Tannehill takes the field. This past season, he led the Titans to the number one seed in the AFC. Fans watched sullenly as they were sent home in the first round by the Cincinnati Bengals. Garoppolo, while not as distinguished as a pass thrower, wins games. In 47 starts, he has led his franchises to 33 wins. His playoff record is 4-2. Tannehill has a 30-13 record with the Titans and a 72-59 career record as a starter. He is 2-3 in the playoffs.With Garoppolo inserted as Tennessee‚Äôs day one starter, the franchise could take a few steps forward in the playoffs.     ']"
51,Blaine Gabbert,"[""Shannon Sharpe claims Tom Brady‚Äôs coaches are on chopping block after loss to Panthers: ‚ÄúThey're about to come for you‚Äù  Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have a lot of issues to deal with on the offense. Whether it's the quarterback, other offensive players or even coordinator Byron Leftwich, something clearly needs to change.  On FOX Sports' Undisputed this morning, NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe expressed his opinion on who will take the brunt of the blame for Brady and the Bucs' struggles. And it's not the seven-time Super Bowl winning quarterback.        UNDISPUTED@undisputed.@ShannonSharpe reacts to Tom Brady's performance in 21-3 loss to the Panthers:21329           Sharpe believes that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers coaches will be the ones taking the heat for the dysmal start, not the players. Most specifically, Leftwich and head coach Todd Bowles. Sharpe said that when the Bucs lost, it is never Brady's fault, but when they won, he got all of the credit. He continued by saying that Brady and his offense's inability to get any production isn't the fault of the defense. But Bowles, who is the defensive play caller, will continue to take the heat for all of it.     Sharpe's final message was that it wasn't fair that the veteran quarterback doesn't suffer the blame or harsh criticism that everyone else around him will endure. Shannon Sharpe: [00:02:27] the Bucs have the third fewest offensive touchdowns this season Shannon Sharpe: [00:02:41] He's on this list with the Panthers Baker Mayfield, PJ Walker and the Bears Justin Fields that field. Look at those guys. He's on that list. Shannon Sharpe: [00:03:11] But let me tell you who will get the blame. LEFTWICH They've got to come for you, Todd Bowles. They're about to come to your defense. They're about to come for you. They're always going to place the blame on somebody else when you lose. Other than Tom Brady. But when they win they get no credit. Todd Bowles don't get no credit. The defense doesn't get any credit. ‚ÄòTom Brady, did you see that throw? He wills them to win it.‚Äô They won because of him. But when they lose, they lose because of everybody else. Is that fair? How is that realistic? You and I both know he was awful. The Bucs are now 26th in third down conversion rate. In the last two games, he's six of 26. What does the defense have to do with that? What does the defense have to do with that? Absolutely nothing.        Would the Bucs ever bench Tom Brady for a younger QB? The Indianapolis Colts announced on Monday afternoon that they had benched quarterback Matt Ryan and will start second-year quarterback Sam Ehlinger for the rest of the season. The Bucs have now lost four of their last five games, the last win was a 21-15 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, which didn't come with controversy over penalties.         Would Tampa Bay ever follow Indianapolis' lead and bench their veteran quarterback Tom Brady? That's not likely for a few reasons. The Colts have apparently been planning this for a while. They moved Ehlinger up to second on the depth chart above Nick Foles, just a few weeks ago. ESPN@espnIs it time to write off Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers after their 3-4 starts@pablotorre, @foxworth24, and @billbarnwell discuss their thoughts and more on the latest @debatable  twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1‚Ä¶989     The Bucs depth chart features Blaine Gabbert and then Kyle Trask. While Trask was finally given an opportunity to showcase his skills during the preseason, it's unlikely the Buccaneers will give him a chance while Brady is still on the roster. But that's not saying that Trask won't surpass Gabbert after the veteran quarterback has officially retired.It's also the overall fact that benching Matt Ryan is a completely different situation than benching a seven-time Super Bowl winning quarterback who has been in the league for 23 seasons.     "", 'Anthony Richardson vs Cam Newton: Comparing Gators QB\'s combine performance against former Auburn star  Anthony Richardson is one of the most polarizing prospects of the 2023 NFL draft. The former Florida Gators quarterback is touted as a first-round quarterback, but there are doubts about whether his skills will be able to translate to the NFL.  Richardson\'s performance at the 2023 NFL Scouting Combine on Saturday should improve his draft stock after a fantastic day. While his athletic ability was never in doubt, he broke long-standing records and his blazing speed caught the attention of observers.        The 21-year-old broke the record of the longest vertical jump for any quarterback since 2003 by scoring a 40.5\'\' jump. The 6\'4\'\' quarterback also ran an excellent 4.44 in the 40-yard dash, one of the fastest-ever for a passer. Anthony Richardson\'s athletic excellence drew comparisons to other former Florida quarterback, Cam Newton.            Both are two strong-armed quarterbacks with threatening rushing ability. How do the two players compare in their Combine performances?  Is Anthony Richardson more athletic than Cam Newton? Comparing the two quarterbacks Although the latest Florida quarterback broke the vertical jump record today, he\'s very similar to Cam in many athletic aspects NFL Research@NFLResearchAnthony Richardson just broke the record for the highest vertical jump (40.5"") by any QB at the combine since at least 2003 @FloridaGators #NFLCombine67597     When Newton performed in 2011, he all but cemented his status as the first overall pick for that year\'s draft. His only real competitor that year was Blaine Gabbert, who ended up in the 10th overall pick with the Jacksonville Jaguars - Jake Locker was taken with the eighth overall pick by the Tennessee Titans. Anthony Richardson\'s competition is higher this year, as Alabama\'s Bryce Young and Ohio State\'s CJ Stroud are set to be the first two quarterbacks taken. However, the excellent Combine performance alongside his great work ethic and some good interviews can improve his stock even further, perhaps landing him in the draft\'s top 5. Having a good athletic profile can cut you a lot of flack in the league, especially as it relates to things such as completing passes in short windows or escaping the pocket to get yards on the move. These are two things that Newton was excellent at, and the Florida star can become a great quarterback with the same playing style.     ', 'Antonio Brown ran the wrong route on his touchdown catch\xa0  It\'s hard to decipher whether Lady Luck was with Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the Super Bowl or whether the team is made up of phenomenal players.  Tom Brady had a commanding performance on the day. Rob Gronkowski was hard to suppress. Patrick Mahomes struggled against the Bucs\' formidable defense as they coasted through Kansas City with a 22-point lead.        In fact, Tampa Bay were so good that when their wide receiver ran the wrong route, the play was executed for a touchdown.           Quarterback Tom Brady threw a perfect laser from the one-yard line to wide receiver Antonio Brown in the end zone with six seconds left in the first half for a touchdown. But the play was not executed as planned. BOOMIN ü§ôüì∫: #SBLV on CBS pic.twitter.com/ytAgUhB7Lh‚Äî Tampa Bay Buccaneers (@Buccaneers) February 8, 2021 According to quarterback coach Clyde Christensen, the wide receiver ran the wrong route. Blaine Gabbert after Antonio Brown ran the wrong route for a touchdown was pretty good though. pic.twitter.com/zGNGvLF5XL‚Äî Michael Hurley (@michaelFhurley) February 10, 2021     Christensen spilled the tea during The Pat McAfee Show. Antonio Brown was expected to go in and then come back out. But he did the reverse, going out and then in, and yet he managed to secure a touchdown. ""That\'s where Brady doesn\'t get thrown for a loop. He just hits the guy. \'Hey, you get open, I\'ll hit you.\' That\'s where he\'s pretty darn unique. A lot of quarterbacks are, \'Hey, he\'s supposed to do this: A to B to C.\' This guy A.B. goes C to F back to A and he just hits him for a touchdown,"" said Christensen. Maybe it was Lady Luck or just a testament to the star quality players Tampa have. Not only did Antonio Brown reach safety Tryann Mathieu, but Brady too did not panic and threw to Brown when he was open.

After the game, Brady was asked about Rob Gronkowski and Antonio Brown adding to the victory. Brady praised their efforts. ""Big-time players making big-time plays. Love what they did, what they added to the team. Gronk\'s an unbelievable player, teammate, talent, work ethic and commitment. And A.B. is just...since he got here, he\'s just done everything the right way. So impressed by him. Proud of him. It takes a lot of people for us to get to this point. We all have great support systems in place and I think everyone should be celebrating them tonight,"" said Brady.     While none of the players were directly asked about the touchdown, Antonio Brown was quick to praise his QB. ""It\'s been a tremendous honor working with Tom, man. He\'s a legend. He\'s a winner. He\'s a good leader. One of the best human beings I know. Even a greater football player. I can\'t speak enough on him for what he\'s meant to me, this moment, everything I\'ve been through,"" an emotional Antonio Brown said in his postgame press conference.     ', 'Ranking the 10 Worst NFL QBs of the 2010s  Quarterback is the most important position in the NFL and that won‚Äôt change for as long as the sport is played.  Over the past decade, we‚Äôve seen some simply stupendous players throw the ball in the NFL, keeping fans astounded on a weekly basis. They impressed one and all with their feats of magic with the ball in their hands.        Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson have all but revolutionised their positions since being drafted, yet not every player can have such a positive impact. As is impossible to avoid, for every success story in the NFL, there is an equally negative outcome for another individual.           The 2010s saw some quite awful quarterback play from a number of guilty parties. Some were so bad that an infamous play is now named after them, whilst others failed to live up to expectations due to an out-of-control off-field life.  Who were the 10 worst NFL quarterbacks of the 2010s? #10 Geno Smith Baltimore Ravens v New York Jets     Geno Smith had talent at the quarterback position, but describing his career in the NFL as a negative snowball would be an understatement. However, it\'s not entirely his fault that he arrived at a poor New York Jets team that was bereft of leadership and veteran presence who were used to winning. After being drafted in the second round of the 2013 NFL Draft, Smith would hugely struggle with interceptions in his first two years, throwing a grand total of 34. He didn‚Äôt inspire any confidence within the locker room either. This ultimately culminated in an unfortunate incident. His own teammate, IK Enemkpali, broke his jaw with a right hook that left Smith out injured for most of the 2015 season. He never regained his place, and has since gone onto become a backup option with the Giants, Chargers and Seahawks. But in terms of quarterback production, Smith stands as one of the worst of the 2010s.      #9 Blaine Gabbert Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Jacksonville Jaguars Thrown into the dumpster fire that has been Jacksonville football for the best part of a decade, Blaine Gabbert has had a forgetful NFL career. It is worth nothing, however, that he is classed as a Super Bowl winner. Gabbert rode Tom Brady‚Äôs coattails to a championship in Tampa Bay, throwing a grand total of 27 passes in three years. But he remains one of the most disappointing picks of the previous decade. Picked 10th overall in the 2011 NFL Draft, Gabbert had a below average rookie year where he threw just 12 touchdown passes, as well as 11 interceptions. He was also sacked 40 times and fumbled the ball on 14 occasions.     It was a setback that he never recovered from, with the Jacksonville Jaguars never really having patience with him as a long-term starter again.  #8 Mark Sanchez New England Patriots v New York Jets Picked up by the New York Jets with the fifth overall pick in 2009, Mark Sanchez was supposed to save NFL football in the Big Apple. Instead, he is somehow remembered the most for his ""butt-fumble."" Ironically, the four years he had as a starter in New York were four of the better years the Jets have had for a long time. They had a strong roster that just needed a better quarterback. Sanchez made too many mistakes, some at the costliest moments, and that became his legacy.     He never finished a season with the Jets without at least nine fumbles. The butt-fumble was the worst of the lot. Not only did Sanchez misread what the play was supposed to be, but he didn‚Äôt have the awareness to know where his own O-Line were positioned. While attempting to slide to safety to avoid Vince Wilfork, he slid into the backside of one of the O-Line members, fumbling the ball in the process. Tobey MaCrier@shaneysmalls@BarstoolPhilly The Sanchez Butt Fumble New York soon lost patience and Sanchez was out, with a specific QB training session called ""The Sanchez Program"" to eliminate QB fumbles being created.      #7 Jake Locker Tennessee Titans v Houston Texans The 2011 NFL Draft saw another QB taken earlier, with Jake Locker going to the Tennessee Titans at #8. When an NFL career lasts four seasons, with a player being a nailed-on starter in just one of them, that tells you everything you need to know. Locker was a backup in his rookie year and was then chosen to lead the Titans in his second year. In 11 starts, he threw for more interceptions than touchdowns and fumbled the ball four times.     Injuries followed, but Locker couldn‚Äôt escape the poor performances when he was on the field. He retired in 2015 citing a loss of passion for the sport, cementing his place as one of the biggest busts of the 2010s.  #6 Brandon Weeden Cleveland Browns v Denver Broncos Another name on the lengthy list of Cleveland Browns QB failures, Brandon Weeden arrived in 2012 as the 22nd pick at 28 years of age. His professional MLB career began with the New York Yankees in 2002, yet just a decade later he was in the NFL.     You have to commend the work ethic, but his career in professional football went exactly as you‚Äôd expect. He started 15 games as a rookie, throwing 14 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. These stats are alarming, but nowhere near as bad as some on this list. However, he just lacked the pop needed to survive in the NFL. His passes were simply not accurate enough and he was never going to take the team to the next level. Weeden\'s poor displays saw him constantly benched throughout his second year in Cleveland, and he was released at the end of the 2012 season.  #5 Christian Ponder Minnesota Vikings v Green Bay Packers     The sample size of Christian Ponder as an NFL quarterback is admittedly much larger than that of others on this list. But that just purely gives us more evidence to understand how bad he was. Given the starting job in Minnesota for three seasons after being drafted 12th overall in 2011, Ponder‚Äôs returns were woeful. His entire career with the Vikings ended with 38 touchdowns and 36 interceptions, as well as 20 fumbles. Ponder struggled to read defenses, even three years into life in the NFL, and he panicked as soon as any defender got near the pocket. He was one of those players who simply didn‚Äôt have the makeup to be an NFL quarterback.  #4 Josh Rosen Arizona Cardinals v Seattle Seahawks     Josh Rosen arrived into the NFL with a lot of hype as part of one of the most stacked QB draft classes in years. He was selected 10th overall by the Arizona Cardinals in 2018, but doubts were raised about his abilities and fit immediately. He would start just 13 games in his one and only year in Arizona, throwing 14 interceptions to 11 touchdowns. Rosen was sacked 45 times and fumbled the ball on 10 occasions to boot. It was a historically bad year for the Cardinals QB, and ironically one which helped the franchise out immensely. They were able to pick first overall in 2019 and got Kyler Murray, the replacement for Rosen. The latter was traded immediately to Miami, where he would start just three games, losing all of them whilst throwing just one touchdown and five interceptions. Rosen didn‚Äôt play at all in 2020 with the San Francisco 49ers, whilst in 2021, he threw just 11 passes all season, two of which were interceptions.     It‚Äôs hard to fathom the 10th overall pick being bounced between four teams in as many years. As a free agent in 2022, his NFL career is essentially over, and it is one of the most forgettable in living memory.  #3 DeShone Kizer Green Bay Packers v Baltimore Ravens Cleveland features heavily on this list, unsurprisingly, and DeShone Kizer was another name they drafted and spat out after years of disappointing performances. Hue Jackson wanted Colin Kaepernick signed, but received Kizer and oversaw the latter play his part in the 0-16 season.     Kizer started a full 15 games in the 2017 NFL season, but his performances were appalling. He completed just 53.6% of his passes, threw double the number of interceptions to touchdowns with 22 and 11 respectively, and fumbled the ball nine times. The fact that he led an NFL team to only the second ever 0-16 season is telling, and he never got to be a starter again. Kizer was traded to Green Bay after his rookie year, where he would throw 42 passes, no touchdowns and two interceptions. He has not played an NFL snap since and is unlikely to ever do so again.  #2 Johnny Manziel Cleveland Browns v Buffalo Bills     The only thing stopping Manziel from reaching the top spot on this list is that he had some natural talent as a quarterback. It‚Äôs almost entirely his own fault that he had such an abysmal career in the NFL. Selected by the Browns, every quarterback‚Äôs favourite franchise, Johnny Football entered the NFL as a celebrity before he had achieved anything at the pro-level. A rookie QB being fined for a hand-gesture made towards opposing fans in a pre-season loss is almost unheard of. Yet Manziel made it a reality. He would be judged accurately by the Browns‚Äô coaching staff, who started Manziel in just two NFL games in 2014. He threw two interceptions and no touchdowns. Many expected 2015 to be the comeback year for Johnny Football. He was settled in Cleveland, but that proved to be his undoing as he appeared to party constantly. That year, he started six games and threw seven touchdowns to five interceptions, but his play was nothing more than below average by quite some distance.     A domestic violence incident was the last straw for the Browns. They were so desperate to get rid of Manziel, theyeven released a statement suggesting his future would be addressed ""as soon as permitted by league rules."" He never played in the NFL again.  #1 Paxton Lynch Atlanta Falcons v Denver Broncos Paxton Lynch was never a first-round calibre quarterback. He was then thrown into an awful situation created by the Denver Broncos and their mismanagement of Peyton Manning‚Äôs retirement. Once in the NFL, Lynch was just awful.     He would never do enough to convince the Broncos that he was starting QB material. Lynch played for the defending Super Bowl champions and threw just two touchdowns in his rookie season. His second season was no better, as he struggled to even get time on the field. The Broncos knew he was a bust and the rest of the watching world did too. Josh Kellem@JoshuaKellem#Broncos traded up for Paxton Lynch during 2016 #NFLDraft he\'s now getting outplayed by Case Cookus(?) in the #USFL if patient, team could\'ve drafted Dak Prescott on Day 2. crazy Lbroncoswire.usatoday.com/2022/06/07/usf‚Ä¶1 He threw 128 passes in the NFL with four being touchdowns and four being interceptions. For a first-round selection, that is a dreadful return on investment.     Lynch then had spells on the practice squads of Seattle and Pittsburgh, never doing enough to earn a deal. His NFL career was as short as it was dismal as a result.He was most recently picked in the 12th round of the United States Football League draft after playing as a third-string QB in the Canadian Football League.

52,Sam Bradford,"['5 NFL QBs who never lived up to the hype  Almost every NFL quarterback prospect comes with a certain amount of risk, but some of them get so hyped that they get labeled as a ""can\'t miss"" propsect. These players almost always get selected toward the top of the NFL Draft the year they come out of college because of the importance that quarterbacks have on the future of a franchise.  While, sometimes, these hyped-up quarterbacks go on to become NFL legends, it doesn\'t always work out that way. The ""can\'t miss"" title doesn\'t always live up to its name as some of the prospects labeled with it go on to fail. Here are five quarterbacks who never lived up to their extremely high expectations.        Hyped NFL QBs who failed to meet expectations           #1 - Ryan Leaf San Diego Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf Ryan Leaf is one of the most infamous players in NFL history to be labeled a bust because of how highly he was rated as a prospect. He shared a draft class with the legendary Peyton Manning, and many scouts believed Leaf was the better quarterback. When the Indianapolis Colts selected Manning, instead of Leaf, with the first overall pick, most thought it was the wrong choice.     SNY@SNYtvFormer NFL QB Ryan Leaf tells @CartonRoberts how being labeled a ""bust"" affected his mental health on.sny.tv/kt7qaYa112 Turns out the Colts couldn\'t have been more right. Peyton Manning is one of the greatest of all time, winning five NFL MVP awards and two Super Bowl rings, while Leaf lasted just 18 games. He has a 4-14 record with 36 interceptions. #2 - Akili Smith Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Akili Smith     Akili Smith was considered an extremely special talent when coming out of college. His elite athelticism and style of play was supposed to usher in the next generation of quarterbacks. Coach Jaiya Figueras@CoachFiguerasThrowback: The day we upset UW and the nation realized that @akili_smith was the truth. UO vs. UW 1997Look at the footwork. 19424 While mobility became a desired trait for teams in search of a quarterback, Akili Smith never worked out the way the Cincinnati Bengals had hoped when they drafted him third overall. He has won just three of his 18 starts while throwing just five touchdowns and 13 interceptions.     NFL QBs who never lived up to their high expectations #3 - Cade McNown Chicago Bears quarterback Cade McNown The Chicago Bears have notoriously struggled to find a legitimate franchise quarterback throughout the majority of their long history. The Bears are one of the most legendary teams in NFL history for many reasons, but quarterbacks haven\'t been one of them.         The Bears thought they had found themselves an elite prospect when they drafted Cade McNown. He had all of the tools that teams looked for in a franchise quarterback, but for whatever reason he never blossomed. He lasted just two years with the Bears and posted a 3-12 record before being cut. He never started another game in his career. #4 - Joey Harrington Detroit Lions quarterback Joey Harrington Joey Harrington was a highly-rated quarterback prospect when the Detroit Lions selected him with with their third-overall draft pick. He was mainly their starting quarterback for four consecutive seasons, but failed to show any consistency. He posted a 18-37 record with 60 touchdowns and 62 interceptions.

He started 21 games split between the Miami Dolphins and Atlanta Falcons, recording a 8-13 record with 19 touchdowns and 23 interceptions. Despite many chances, he never lived up to his potential. #5 - Sam Bradford St. Louis Rams quarterback Sam Bradford     Sam Bradford was selected as the first overall pick in the NFL Draft by the St. Louis Rams after winning the Heisman Trophy for his outstanding performance in college football. While his overall career as a quarterback wasn\'t as bad as some of the other names on this list, he failed to meet the huge expectations of being the number one overall pick.     Most labeled Bradford a ""can\'t miss"" prospect coming out of college and almost everyone expected him to find great success. He jumped around and started with four different teams during his career. His overall production was uninspiring. He finished with a 34-48-1 record across eight mediocre seasons while failing to ever reach his true potential, despite receiving every opportunity to do so.

The annual process, where NFL teams select eligible college football players to their roster, is one of the most anticipated off-season events.  The first overall pick in the draft is highly coveted. They are considered the best of the best, with high expectations placed on them from the start. While many of them struggle to adapt to life in the NFL, there are a few that have hit the ground running since day one.        In this article, we take a look at six first-overall picks who not only lived up to their potential and hype, but went on to win the NFL Rookie of the Year award. It is worth noting that each of the six players are also Heisman Trophy winners.           #1. Earl Campbell - Houston Oilers (1978) Nicknamed Tyler Rose due to his running style, Campbell was a dominant force the moment he entered the NFL in 1978. Drafted from the Texas Longhorns football program, the running back was selected by the Houston Oilers, who signed him to a six-year contract. Across 15 games in his rookie season, the 1977 Heisman Trophy winner impressively had 302 carries for 1,450 yards and scored 13 touchdowns. Campbell won several awards for his performances and his emergence contributed to the ""Luv Ya Blue"" movement. #2. Billy Sims - Detroit Lions (1980) Sims wasted no time in bursting onto the scene in his rookie season. The running back was drafted from the Oklahoma Sooners football program by the Detroit Lions, where he spent the entirety of his short professional career.     The St. Louis-born Sims, who entered the NFL as a Heisman Trophy winner, had 313 carries for 1,303 yards and scored 16 touchdowns across 16 matches in his rookie season. This announced him to the whole of the league and got him his first Pro Bowl selection. #3. George Rogers - New Orleans Saints (1981) Rogers famed himself as a bruising running back when he entered the NFL in 1981. His powerful running style helped him break tackles and gain tough yards. Drafted by the New Orleans Saints, Rogers made an immediate impact in his rookie season. The former South Carolina Gamecocks talent recorded 378 carries for 1,674 yards and scored 13 touchdowns across 16 games if his rookie season. The performance of the 1980 Heisman Trophy winner earned him his first Pro Bowl. #4. Sam Bradford - St. Louis Rams (2010) After the first three had won theirs in the span of four years, it took 29 years before Bradford broke the jinx. Bradford was a highly-touted quarterback prospect coming out of the Oklahoma Sooners football program in 2010.     RJ Young@RJ_YoungSam Bradford and Vince Young each won NFL AP Rookie of the Year.

Winning the Heisman Trophy in 2008, Bradford quickly showed his talent with the Rams his rookie season, throwing for 3,512 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions across 16 games in 2010. #5. Cam Newton - Carolina Panthers (2011) Newton took the NFL by storm with his dynamism in 2011. Having won the Heisman Trophy with the Auburn Tigers in 2010, the Atlanta-born quarterback was drafted by the Panthers, signing a four-year contract worth over $22 million.

Kyler Murray - Arizona Cardinals (2019) Murray is the latest first-overall draft pick to claim the NFL Rookie of the Year award. Coming out of the Oklahoma Sooners football program, Murray was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals, where he proved his talent in his rookie season.The 2018 Heisman Trophy winner ended his rookie season with 3,722 passing yards, 20 passing touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. The quarterback also recorded 544 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns on 93 carries.

It denotes/connotes a certain player\'s lack of performance relative to his/her potential, but how can it be gauged when no games have been actually been played yet?  That was the question Redditor u/pot8odragon posed late on Tuesday.

A rundown of the most ""overrated"" Heisman Trophy winners in the 21st century Tim Tebow is arguably one of the most polarizing Heisman winners ever     While Anthony Richardson never won the Heisman Trophy (Bryce Young did in 2021, and he has to play multiple years first before opinions on him can be made), he is rather fortunate to have done so, as a good number of its winners in modern times have never truly evolved into generational talents, leading to a perception of the award as ""overrated"". While the likes of Derrick Henry (2015), Lamar Jackson (2016), and Joe Burrow (2019) have become legitimate stars, others have not been as blessed. The first 21st-century winner to fail to live up to the promise of the award was Eric Crouch in 2001, who barely played in the NFL before bouncing around teams. Another example is Jason White (2003), who went undrafted in 2005 and decided to focus on business. But the Heisman did not become retroactively notorious until Tim Tebow (2007). Tebow was already known for his outspokenness on his beliefs, which many believe eventually overshadowed his on-field play. The following year\'s winner Sam Bradford, is better known for earning large amounts of money for subpar play.     Mark Ingram II (2009) helped to restore its credibility by putting up a respectable Pro Bowl career, while Cam Newton (2010) became a legitimate superstar. But the next two winners after them seemingly reasserted the Heisman as an ""overrated"" award. Robert Griffin III (2011) had a wonderful rookie season, but injuries derailed his career. But Johnny Manziel, who made award history the following year as its first freshman recipient, severely tarnished its reputation by becoming a massive draft bust who was more famous for wild partying and run-ins with the law than for on-field performance.Jameis Winston (2013) and Marcus Mariota (2014) have had better careers since receiving their award, but it would not arguably shed the ""overrated"" stigma until Henry.     ', 'NFL Draft: Ranking the 10 biggest shocks  The NFL Draft is one of the most dramatic experiences in sports for all involved. Teams are banking their future on the shoulders of one player, while players are on the verge of being called a professional and being set for life financially.  With the stakes being this high, the public interest in the NFL Draft is monumental and is only growing with every passing year. This, however, comes with certain moments of madness.        Pressure can make people do funny things, make mistakes and even lose all sense of reason. We‚Äôve seen this throughout the years of the NFL Draft.           What are the top 10 biggest NFL Draft shocks? 10. Washington trades the farm for RG III Dallas Cowboys v Washington Redskins Robert Griffin III would have been the standout quarterback in pretty much any other NFL Draft class, yet in declaring for the NFL Draft in 2012, he ensured he would be taken behind Andrew Luck.     With the Indianapolis Colts‚Äô ""Lose for Luck"" campaign having worked a treat, it was the St. Louis Rams who held the #2 pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, but they already had their quarterback in Sam Bradford, who they selected first overall in 2010. As such, teams around the NFL knew that the Rams were open to trading down and allowing someone else to take Griffin and his prodigious talent. Washington was a team that had a strong roster and felt they were only a quarterback away from really challenging, and the chance to secure Griffin opening up felt like a miracle. However, the price was to be heavy and remains one of the most shocking trades in NFL Draft history. Washington gave up three first-round picks over the course of 2012, 2013 and 2014, as well as a second-round pick in 2012. While not quite the bounty that Mike Ditka once gave away‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll get to that later ... it was a rarity in the modern era of the NFL where draft selections are so highly valued.     9. Aaron Rodgers‚Äô green room nightmare Pittsburg Steelers v Green Bay Packers There was something rather poetic about the 2005 NFL Draft. The best quarterback prospect in it, Aaron Rodgers, came from Chico, California, and the San Francisco 49ers had both the first-overall selection and a need for a new quarterback. In no universe did the 49ers not take Rodgers, yet there was a huge shock when, on draft day, the Niners threw a curveball into the proceedings. Alex Smith was their chosen signal caller, picked with the first overall selection, while Rodgers would be condemned to a dramatic slide down the NFL Draft board.     With the NFL Draft now a televised event and the age of the internet giving fans a lot more access to information regarding the collegiate career of a player, Rodgers dropping so much was massive. As were the regular camera shots we got of the crestfallen quarterback sitting alone in the green room, waiting for his phone to ring. What was even more shocking was where he eventually got taken. Pick no.24 which belonged to the Green Bay Packers, who had a certain Brett Favre already in place. It was the worst possible end to the worst possible day for Rodgers, and we got to see it play out right on our screens, although history will show the Packers were the perfect home for him. 8. Mel Kiper Jr vs Bill Tobin Mel Kiper has a long history of NFL Draft predictions     ‚ÄúWho in the hell is Mel Kiper anyway?‚Äù These were the famous words spoken by the general manager of the Indianapolis Colts, Bill Tobin, in the immediate aftermath of the 1994 NFL Draft. ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr. made a name for himself with his draft analysis and vocal criticism of the selections teams had made, especially if they didn‚Äôt match up to what he had predicted prior to the draft. However, this spilled over into a dramatic argument in 1994 after Kiper took aim at the Colts selecting linebacker Trev Alberts over quarterback Trent Dilfer, with the fifth overall pick. ‚ÄúI think it was a typical Colts move, the Colts needed a quarterback. To pass up Trent Dilfer when all you have is Jim Harbaugh‚Ä¶ give me a break. That‚Äôs why the Colts are picking second every year in the draft,‚Äù Kiper exclaimed.     The subsequent row between Tobin and Kiper was television gold and is one of the major contributing factors as to why the NFL Draft is such a well-watched television event in the modern era. NFL Network@nflnetwork#NFLDraft history: 23 years ago today, the @Colts selected RB @marshallfaulk 2nd overall in the 1994 Draft.11:00 PM ¬∑ Apr 24, 2017366101 7, Minnesota Vikings miss their pick two years running Minnesota Vikings made a timing error in two straight years     Missing your NFL Draft selection due to running out of time on the clock is an occurrence so rare that it barely figures into the thoughts of fans‚Ä¶ aside from those in Minnesota. You see, the Vikings made NFL history in a spectacularly bumbling fashion when they missed their first-round selection in two successive years. Starting in the 2002 NFL Draft, the Vikings had a chance to move up and take advantage of the Dallas Cowboys being slow on the trigger. The Cowboys surrendered their sixth overall pick due to running out of time, and this put the Vikings on the clock. However, confusion reigned in the Minnesota war-room, and they didn‚Äôt put in their card quickly enough, which allowed the Cowboys to control the fate of the pick, despite not technically having it. The Dallas franchise was able to execute a trade with the Kansas City Chiefs, which the Vikings weren‚Äôt aware of, and the Chiefs moved above them to select defensive tackle Ryan Sims.     Technically, the Vikings didn‚Äôt lose out, as they retained the original seventh selection, but the chance to move up was missed due to their lack of awareness. Fast forward to 2003, and it was, once again, the Vikings making draft headlines for all the wrong reasons. The Vikings held the seventh overall pick for the second successive year, but they were attempting to trade down with the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens wanted to select quarterback Byron Leftwich, and Minnesota believed they had completed all facets of a trade with the Baltimore club and immediately put their feet up. The problem was, an issue with Baltimore meant the trade hadn‚Äôt been officially filed, and time ran out on the pick, which still belonged to the Vikings. Again, chaos was the overriding feeling in the Minnesota war-room, with the Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars both putting their picks in quickly to move ahead of the Vikings.     Minnesota would select at ninth overall, but had missed out on receiving the two picks in the later rounds that Baltimore offered, and the franchise was, once again, the laughing stock of NFL Draft day. 6. Raiders select a punter in round 1 Al Davis was a pioneer with some of his NFL Draft moves Al Davis‚Äô NFL Draft legacy is one that is admired around the league. He may well have not always got things right, but the legendary Raiders owner was always willing to give players and positions a chance.     No better example of this came than in the 1973 NFL Draft, when the Raiders selected a punter in the first round. While Ray Guy ended up being, arguably, the greatest punter of all time, using a first-round choice on a punter was shocking, and still would be to this day, but that was Al Davis. 5. Denver Broncos trade up to take Tim Tebow Denver Broncos Introduce Tim Tebow Tebow Mania swept the United States in 2010. His performances with the Florida Gators and immense religious positivity built him a huge platform across the country.     NFL Draft experts and player analysts alike were stunned to see the meteoric rise of Tim Tebow, especially with few people having anything more than a third-round grade on him. Question marks around his throwing power were present, while few thought he was anything other than a good leader. So when the Denver Broncos moved up to the 25th pick in the 2010 NFL Draft, the world was stunned when they took Tebow. All of a sudden, Tebow Mania hit a fever pitch, and he was now going to be the starting quarterback for the Broncos, who had given up second, third and fourth-round picks to secure the deal. Overwhelming positivity was the emotion coming out of the Broncos‚Äô fan-base, as well as the watching public, but this was a move nobody could have predicted, and it stunned everyone. 4. Laremy Tunsil‚Äôs gas mask incident Laremy Tunsil pictured just before his NFL Draft drama developed     Social media has had an irreparable impact on professional sports, and it is completely down to a person‚Äôs personal beliefs whether or not they feel that impact is positive or not. Laremy Tunsil was the best offensive lineman in the 2016 NFL Draft and, perhaps, the best player on the board outright. He was the lock number one pick in 2016, with the Tennessee Titans expected to select him there once the evening began, until they traded the pick to the Rams. However, drama was just around the corner as in the hours leading up to the 2016 NFL Draft, an image of Tunsil wearing a gas mask and smoking a bong emerged on Twitter. What was so bizarre about this whole episode was the fact that the image was uploaded on Tunsil‚Äôs own account, with his agent declaring that the player had been hacked. This quick explanation wasn‚Äôt enough to convince teams of Tunsil‚Äôs professionalism, and they were simply terrified of using such a high pick on a player that may well face disciplinary action for the act depicted in the image.     With rumors and speculation being the subject of NFL Draft coverage that year, Tunsil slid down draft boards, to an alarming degree. As fans scrambled to figure out who was behind the picture leak, mathematicians among the audience were trying to figure out how much each dropped pick was costing the offensive lineman. The Miami Dolphins eventually selected him with the 13th overall pick, but he should never have been down that low in the draft, with fans getting the first glimpse of just how damaging social media could be. 3. Eli Manning refuses to play for the San Diego Chargers Eli Manning as a Charger     The 2004 NFL Draft was one of the better classes for quarterbacks, with Eli Manning, Ben Roethlisberger and Philip Rivers all tipped to be selected within the first 10 picks. Manning was seen as the standout talent and the natural choice first overall, a pick that belonged to the San Diego Chargers. When it became clear that the Chargers would hold the first pick, the Manning media machine began working in overdrive, making it clear he didn‚Äôt want to play in San Diego. Many believe that Archie Manning had a concern that the Chargers weren‚Äôt built to ever succeed, and he didn‚Äôt want his son to be stuck in a dead-end spot like he was with the New Orleans Saints. Nobody knew what the Chargers would do, with the team suggesting they wouldn‚Äôt be bullied into selecting another player, or even trading the pick. Eli Manning stayed, somewhat, quiet during the process, with this supporting the belief that Manning Sr. was in the driving seat of the plan.     However, the camp wasn‚Äôt afraid to leak that Eli would be happy to sit out the 2004 season, and by the time the NFL Draft arrived, speculation was at a fever pitch as to just what would happen. The Chargers stuck to their word and selected Manning with the first pick, which made for perhaps the most awkward commissioner/jersey picture in league history‚Ä¶ yet the drama wasn‚Äôt over. NFL UK@NFLUKIn a parallel universe...Eli Manning played for the @chargers.Rivers at the @Giants.and Big Ben is still waiting 6:00 PM ¬∑ Apr 24, 2020302 The Chargers had selected Manning as leverage, knowing that holding his registration was more valuable than the pick itself, and later in the night a trade was completed with the New York Giants, which saw Philip Rivers traded to San Diego and Manning head to the Big Apple, satisfying the Manning family‚Äôs demands.     2. John Elway refuses to play for the Baltimore Colts John Elway threatened to join Major League Baseball over the Baltimore Colts The Baltimore Colts held the first overall pick in the 1983 NFL Draft, and the standout prospect in that class was the prodigious quarterback, John Elway. What preceded the draft was a long period of speculation that Elway would refuse to play for the Colts if they drafted him. The makeup of the NFL Draft was different back in 1983, yet Elway was able to virtually say, for months, that he didn‚Äôt want to play in Baltimore, although never giving a reason. Instead, he threatened to head to Major League Baseball where he was drafted by the New York Yankees.     Elway‚Äôs father tried to orchestrate a trade with the Colts prior to the draft, with Elway wanting to play on the West Coast. This didn‚Äôt happen, and the Colts ended up drafting Elway with the first overall pick. ‚ÄúJohn will never play for Irsay or Coach Kush,‚Äù declared Jack Elway Sr at a press conference held on draft day. ‚ÄúRight now it looks like I‚Äôll be playing baseball with the Yankees,‚Äù John Elway himself added. The story, however, didn‚Äôt end there, and six days after he was drafted by Baltimore, Elway was traded to the Denver Broncos, where he would become a Hall of Fame quarterback, winning two Super Bowls. 1. Mike Ditka‚Äôs Ricky Williams trade Ricky Williams became the apple of Mike Ditka\'s eye     While it is somewhat tempting to put Kevin Costner‚Äôs incredible draft day trade for the fictional Cleveland Browns here, there is no competition for the most shocking moment in NFL Draft history. Mike Ditka‚Äôs coaching record is historic, as was his success with the Chicago Bears. However, it is impossible to remember the flamboyant character without pointing to the biggest trade in NFL history, which he instigated. Ricky Williams was a phenomenal running back for the Texas Longhorns, winning the Heisman Trophy in 1998 and setting the National Collegiate Athletic Association record for rushing yards. He was set to be the darling of the 1999 NFL Draft, and Ditka fell in love with his talent, to the degree he bet the entire farm, and more, to bring him to New Orleans. Ditka felt Williams was the second coming of Walter Payton, although other teams had doubts over his professionalism and commitment to the sport.     The Saints were positioned 12th in the NFL Draft order and had little to no leverage in the trade market, especially after Ditka publicly claimed he would trade his entire draft for Williams at the owners\' meeting. After initially offering a bundle of picks to the Bengals, the Saints were eventually able to move up to fifth overall after executing a trade with Washington. It was an explosive moment, with Washington receiving the 12th overall pick in the 1999 NFL Draft, the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh round picks in the same year. This wasn‚Äôt all as the Saints also gave up their first and third-round picks in the 2000 NFL Draft. It was a huge deal, with stakes never before seen being offered up by the Saints, and upon announcement, it was the most shocking NFL Draft moment ever recorded, although only slightly more eye-catching than the wedding-themed ESPN Magazine cover featuring both Ditka and Williams.

53,Josh Rosen,"[""What went wrong for QB Josh Rosen as the 2018 no.10 pick continues to struggle  The San Francisco 49ers have waived quarterback Josh Rosen, who will now look for his fifth team since being drafted in 2018.  The 49ers signed Josh Rosen off of Tampa Bay's practice squad late in the 2020 season. He struggled to impress in training camp, and 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan has been vocal about Rosen's poor performance.        ‚ÄúJosh Rosen is good, he was just in a bad situation‚Äù pic.twitter.com/yua7XvzVt3‚Äî dk üí´ (@HoodieSiakam) August 15, 2021           In the 49ers' first preseason game this year, Rosen played most of the second half and went 10/15 for 93 yards and an interception. That performance wasn't enough for the team to retain him for the upcoming season. It has been a torrid time in the NFL for Rosen, but what exactly happened?  What has gone wrong with QB Josh Rosen? Josh Rosen had 16 starts in 20 games through four seasons with four different teams. His high draft selection could be the only reason we are still talking about Rosen today.      The debate for years has been whether Josh Rosen's issues come from not getting a fair shake in the NFL. First-year head coach Steve Wilks made his first big move with the Cardinals with Josh Rosen, the fourth QB drafted and seen as possibly the best QB in the class.  His main flaws at the time were a need to grow up and mature into a better leader. As many do, Rosen had a poor rookie year, but Wilks was fired once Kliff Kingsbury became available. JOSH ROSEN'S REVENGE TOUR IS ON üî•üî•üî• pic.twitter.com/ea5ZrP816i‚Äî Press Cover (@Press_Cover) August 15, 2021     Kliff Kingsbury wanted his guy for his system, and the best fit was Kyler Murray, the no.1 overall pick. Rosen was then traded to Miami, where he competed with Ryan Fitzpatrick, but struggled again, as he was tossed into a starting role before he was ready, which damaged his confidence.  Miami took QB Tua Tagovailoa 5th overall the next season, and it was deja vu for Josh Rosen. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers placed him in their practice squad and hoped to groom him with Tom Brady's help. But Rosen chose not to win a Super Bowl ring and signed with the 49ers. However, they took QB Trey Lance at #3 this year, and the rest is history. Breaking üö®: 49ers Waive QB Josh Rosen #NeverForget pic.twitter.com/crCqxeYFXc‚Äî The Slumpbuster (@SlumpBusterPod) August 17, 2021     By now, it's a surprise that Rosen has chosen to remain in the NFL, so big props to him. Anyone's mental state and confidence would have been shredded to bits after being replaced three times by high draft picks that resulted in the player being shipped elsewhere.  Every team he's been in, other than Tampa Bay, was a poor fit for Rosen, even Arizona. Looking back, Josh Rosen needed a team with a veteran starter ahead of him, as he clearly wasn't NFL-ready but was full of potential. Two or three years of learning on the bench would've been the best for him. Honestly, the Pittsburgh Steelers came up every time Rosen became available. Josh Rosen was a victim of 'wrong place, wrong time' in the NFL and could return to his prime at 24. In his preseason game, his skills looked rusty, possibly because of his state of mind. Pittsburgh may still make sense, as their coaching staff is elite in finding the best in their players. The Dallas Cowboys, Seattle Seahawks, Tennessee Titans and LA Rams could also sit him on the bench and teach him from scratch.     "", '‚ÄúLeBron playing against Jordan‚Äôs competition finally‚Äù, ‚ÄúSomebody‚Äôs feeling insecure after Steph won ring #4‚Äù - Fans post mixed reactions to LeBron James‚Äô Drew League return  LA Lakers superstar LeBron James played in the Los Angeles-based Pro-Am Drew League for the first time since 2011. James dominated the proceedings in Saturday\'s MMV Cheaters vs. Black Pearl game.  The four-time NBA MVP bagged 42 points, 16 rebounds and four steals to lead his team, the MMV Cheaters, to a narrow 104-102 win. James, coming off an injury-riddled campaign, appeared to be in great shape.         He produced several highlight reels during the contest. He paired up alongside DeMar DeRozan, who tallied 30 points and 14 rebounds.      James entered the offseason early. He missed seven of the last eight regular-season LA Lakers games. The team failed to make it to the postseason. That made James\' return to the court even more exciting for fans. It was a lengthy three-month absence, which is rare, considering James has played deep into the playoffs for majority of his career. As always, NBA Twitter erupted after seeing a polarizing figure like LeBron James taking part in a Pro-Am tournament after so long. With him outplaying his competition, the noise surrounding his appearance only increased. It drew hilarious yet mixed reactions from his fans and critics.

However, Irving never showed up. Drew League commissioner Dino Smiley was unaware of the reason behind the Nets star\'s absence. He thought it was a ""sure bet"" that Irving would appear, but that wasn\'t the case.     The Brooklyn Nets All-Star guard reportedly participated in Lakers assistant coach Phil Handy\'s all-girls basketball training camp in LA. A viral video surfaced showing Irving teaching the campers some skill moves of his own. His appearance at Handy\'s camp only fueled rumors about his possible trade to reunite with James in LA. Handy was the assistant coach on the James and Irving-led Cavaliers team that made three NBA Finals appearances in a row, winning the title once.The Lakers have been looking to get rid of Russell Westbrook and have already engaged in discussions with the Brooklyn Nets over a possible trade swap. The teams haven\'t reached an agreement yet.     ', 'Ranking the 10 Worst NFL QBs of the 2010s  Quarterback is the most important position in the NFL and that won‚Äôt change for as long as the sport is played.  Over the past decade, we‚Äôve seen some simply stupendous players throw the ball in the NFL, keeping fans astounded on a weekly basis. They impressed one and all with their feats of magic with the ball in their hands.        Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson have all but revolutionised their positions since being drafted, yet not every player can have such a positive impact. As is impossible to avoid, for every success story in the NFL, there is an equally negative outcome for another individual.           The 2010s saw some quite awful quarterback play from a number of guilty parties. Some were so bad that an infamous play is now named after them, whilst others failed to live up to expectations due to an out-of-control off-field life.  Who were the 10 worst NFL quarterbacks of the 2010s? #10 Geno Smith Baltimore Ravens v New York Jets     Geno Smith had talent at the quarterback position, but describing his career in the NFL as a negative snowball would be an understatement. However, it\'s not entirely his fault that he arrived at a poor New York Jets team that was bereft of leadership and veteran presence who were used to winning. After being drafted in the second round of the 2013 NFL Draft, Smith would hugely struggle with interceptions in his first two years, throwing a grand total of 34. He didn‚Äôt inspire any confidence within the locker room either. This ultimately culminated in an unfortunate incident. His own teammate, IK Enemkpali, broke his jaw with a right hook that left Smith out injured for most of the 2015 season. He never regained his place, and has since gone onto become a backup option with the Giants, Chargers and Seahawks. But in terms of quarterback production, Smith stands as one of the worst of the 2010s.      #9 Blaine Gabbert Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Jacksonville Jaguars Thrown into the dumpster fire that has been Jacksonville football for the best part of a decade, Blaine Gabbert has had a forgetful NFL career. It is worth nothing, however, that he is classed as a Super Bowl winner. Gabbert rode Tom Brady‚Äôs coattails to a championship in Tampa Bay, throwing a grand total of 27 passes in three years. But he remains one of the most disappointing picks of the previous decade. Picked 10th overall in the 2011 NFL Draft, Gabbert had a below average rookie year where he threw just 12 touchdown passes, as well as 11 interceptions. He was also sacked 40 times and fumbled the ball on 14 occasions.     It was a setback that he never recovered from, with the Jacksonville Jaguars never really having patience with him as a long-term starter again.  #8 Mark Sanchez New England Patriots v New York Jets Picked up by the New York Jets with the fifth overall pick in 2009, Mark Sanchez was supposed to save NFL football in the Big Apple. Instead, he is somehow remembered the most for his ""butt-fumble."" Ironically, the four years he had as a starter in New York were four of the better years the Jets have had for a long time. They had a strong roster that just needed a better quarterback. Sanchez made too many mistakes, some at the costliest moments, and that became his legacy.     He never finished a season with the Jets without at least nine fumbles. The butt-fumble was the worst of the lot. Not only did Sanchez misread what the play was supposed to be, but he didn‚Äôt have the awareness to know where his own O-Line were positioned. While attempting to slide to safety to avoid Vince Wilfork, he slid into the backside of one of the O-Line members, fumbling the ball in the process. Tobey MaCrier@shaneysmalls@BarstoolPhilly The Sanchez Butt Fumble New York soon lost patience and Sanchez was out, with a specific QB training session called ""The Sanchez Program"" to eliminate QB fumbles being created.      #7 Jake Locker Tennessee Titans v Houston Texans The 2011 NFL Draft saw another QB taken earlier, with Jake Locker going to the Tennessee Titans at #8. When an NFL career lasts four seasons, with a player being a nailed-on starter in just one of them, that tells you everything you need to know. Locker was a backup in his rookie year and was then chosen to lead the Titans in his second year. In 11 starts, he threw for more interceptions than touchdowns and fumbled the ball four times.     Injuries followed, but Locker couldn‚Äôt escape the poor performances when he was on the field. He retired in 2015 citing a loss of passion for the sport, cementing his place as one of the biggest busts of the 2010s.  #6 Brandon Weeden Cleveland Browns v Denver Broncos Another name on the lengthy list of Cleveland Browns QB failures, Brandon Weeden arrived in 2012 as the 22nd pick at 28 years of age. His professional MLB career began with the New York Yankees in 2002, yet just a decade later he was in the NFL.     You have to commend the work ethic, but his career in professional football went exactly as you‚Äôd expect. He started 15 games as a rookie, throwing 14 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. These stats are alarming, but nowhere near as bad as some on this list. However, he just lacked the pop needed to survive in the NFL. His passes were simply not accurate enough and he was never going to take the team to the next level. Weeden\'s poor displays saw him constantly benched throughout his second year in Cleveland, and he was released at the end of the 2012 season.  #5 Christian Ponder Minnesota Vikings v Green Bay Packers     The sample size of Christian Ponder as an NFL quarterback is admittedly much larger than that of others on this list. But that just purely gives us more evidence to understand how bad he was. Given the starting job in Minnesota for three seasons after being drafted 12th overall in 2011, Ponder‚Äôs returns were woeful. His entire career with the Vikings ended with 38 touchdowns and 36 interceptions, as well as 20 fumbles. Ponder struggled to read defenses, even three years into life in the NFL, and he panicked as soon as any defender got near the pocket. He was one of those players who simply didn‚Äôt have the makeup to be an NFL quarterback.  #4 Josh Rosen Arizona Cardinals v Seattle Seahawks     Josh Rosen arrived into the NFL with a lot of hype as part of one of the most stacked QB draft classes in years. He was selected 10th overall by the Arizona Cardinals in 2018, but doubts were raised about his abilities and fit immediately. He would start just 13 games in his one and only year in Arizona, throwing 14 interceptions to 11 touchdowns. Rosen was sacked 45 times and fumbled the ball on 10 occasions to boot. It was a historically bad year for the Cardinals QB, and ironically one which helped the franchise out immensely. They were able to pick first overall in 2019 and got Kyler Murray, the replacement for Rosen. The latter was traded immediately to Miami, where he would start just three games, losing all of them whilst throwing just one touchdown and five interceptions. Rosen didn‚Äôt play at all in 2020 with the San Francisco 49ers, whilst in 2021, he threw just 11 passes all season, two of which were interceptions.     It‚Äôs hard to fathom the 10th overall pick being bounced between four teams in as many years. As a free agent in 2022, his NFL career is essentially over, and it is one of the most forgettable in living memory.  #3 DeShone Kizer Green Bay Packers v Baltimore Ravens Cleveland features heavily on this list, unsurprisingly, and DeShone Kizer was another name they drafted and spat out after years of disappointing performances. Hue Jackson wanted Colin Kaepernick signed, but received Kizer and oversaw the latter play his part in the 0-16 season.     Kizer started a full 15 games in the 2017 NFL season, but his performances were appalling. He completed just 53.6% of his passes, threw double the number of interceptions to touchdowns with 22 and 11 respectively, and fumbled the ball nine times. The fact that he led an NFL team to only the second ever 0-16 season is telling, and he never got to be a starter again. Kizer was traded to Green Bay after his rookie year, where he would throw 42 passes, no touchdowns and two interceptions. He has not played an NFL snap since and is unlikely to ever do so again.  #2 Johnny Manziel Cleveland Browns v Buffalo Bills     The only thing stopping Manziel from reaching the top spot on this list is that he had some natural talent as a quarterback. It‚Äôs almost entirely his own fault that he had such an abysmal career in the NFL. Selected by the Browns, every quarterback‚Äôs favourite franchise, Johnny Football entered the NFL as a celebrity before he had achieved anything at the pro-level. A rookie QB being fined for a hand-gesture made towards opposing fans in a pre-season loss is almost unheard of. Yet Manziel made it a reality. He would be judged accurately by the Browns‚Äô coaching staff, who started Manziel in just two NFL games in 2014. He threw two interceptions and no touchdowns. Many expected 2015 to be the comeback year for Johnny Football. He was settled in Cleveland, but that proved to be his undoing as he appeared to party constantly. That year, he started six games and threw seven touchdowns to five interceptions, but his play was nothing more than below average by quite some distance.     A domestic violence incident was the last straw for the Browns. They were so desperate to get rid of Manziel, theyeven released a statement suggesting his future would be addressed ""as soon as permitted by league rules."" He never played in the NFL again.  #1 Paxton Lynch Atlanta Falcons v Denver Broncos Paxton Lynch was never a first-round calibre quarterback. He was then thrown into an awful situation created by the Denver Broncos and their mismanagement of Peyton Manning‚Äôs retirement. Once in the NFL, Lynch was just awful.     He would never do enough to convince the Broncos that he was starting QB material. Lynch played for the defending Super Bowl champions and threw just two touchdowns in his rookie season. His second season was no better, as he struggled to even get time on the field. The Broncos knew he was a bust and the rest of the watching world did too. Josh Kellem@JoshuaKellem#Broncos traded up for Paxton Lynch during 2016 #NFLDraft he\'s now getting outplayed by Case Cookus(?) in the #USFL if patient, team could\'ve drafted Dak Prescott on Day 2. crazy Lbroncoswire.usatoday.com/2022/06/07/usf‚Ä¶1 He threw 128 passes in the NFL with four being touchdowns and four being interceptions. For a first-round selection, that is a dreadful return on investment.     Lynch then had spells on the practice squads of Seattle and Pittsburgh, never doing enough to earn a deal. His NFL career was as short as it was dismal as a result.He was most recently picked in the 12th round of the United States Football League draft after playing as a third-string QB in the Canadian Football League.     ', 'Why did Lamar Jackson refuse to run the 40-yard dash? Inside Ravens superstar‚Äôs NFL Combine issue  For years, the NFL Combine has become a way for NFL players to showcase their talent to interested teams. An event lasting for hours, there are plenty of activities one can take part in. Lamar Jackson, currently with the Baltimore Ravens, always wanted to be drafted as a quarterback.  Buffalo Bills@BuffaloBillsBaker Mayfield. Josh Rosen. Lamar Jackson. Josh Allen.: #NFLCombine on @nflnetwork467107        Irrespective of the result, the combine is essential for players and how teams evaluate them. Sometimes, poor performances during the NFL Combine can directly affect an athlete\'s draft number.           Jackson, the Ravens\' No. 32 overall pick in the first round, refused to run the 40-yard dash. Apparently, his decision came after a team wanted to see how he would play if converted to a wide receiver. Jackson decided that he would only throw and not take part in any of the speed drills. He revealed details about the Combine while on the Ravens podcast, shortly after he was drafted by the team. ""It was a Chargers scout who told me about it. He was the first one to come to me about it. I\'m like, \'What?\' He caught me off guard with it. He added: ""I even made a face at first like, \'What?\' I thought he was trying to be funny, but he kept going with it. So it just became blown out of proportion"".     Lamar Jackson at the Pittsburgh Steelers v Baltimore Ravens game  Can Lamar Jackson hit the market as a free agent soon? Since last season, the Ravens and Jackson have been trying to find common ground for a long-term deal. However, the team and the QB haven\'t come to any conclusion about the numbers yet.

However, reports added that Jackson wanted more guaranteed money.Lamar Jackson at the Denver Broncos v Baltimore Ravens gameWith Jackson not playing a complete season with the Ravens, the team might be hesitant to offer him a contract.     ', 'Evaluating the rookie quarterbacks with three weeks to go  We have now played 14 weeks and it is time to reflect a little. At this point I want to take a look at the five rookie signal-callers, who were drafted in the first round and all played between four and twelve games.  To make this clear, I didn‚Äôt want to rank the quarterbacks against each other because I think it‚Äôs still too early for that, but we can see what they have shown so far and talk about them. So I listed them purely based on where they were drafted at.        While all of them have shown promise and won some big games, the guy at the very top has truly stood out.            #1 Baker Mayfield While I thought the Browns reached for some players in the draft, I had no problem with the selection of Baker Mayfield at the top. I had Darnold as my number one quarterback, but Mayfield was in that group of three that I thought were all worth top five or six picks. He was kept on the sidelines for the first two-and-a-half weeks of the 2018 season, but when Tyrod Taylor had to go into the locker room in that Thursday night game versus the Jets, Baker came onto the field and hasn‚Äôt given up his job ever since. Not only has he given the Dawg Pound a ton of energy, he has also clearly been the top rookie quarterback and with all those outstanding rookies at all the other positions, he is right up there with the very best of that class. The numbers bear it out.     Mayfield has by far the highest completion percentage (64.4%) and yards per attempt (7.7) among all rookie signal-callers. I liked his arm and I thought he was a much better athlete than people gave him credit for, but he exceeded even my expectations. Baker throws a much tighter spiral and has a way stronger arm than you‚Äôd expect from a six-foot Big XII quarterback. He gets the ball out with anticipation, zip and pin-point accuracy. When you watch Baker‚Äôs first live-action versus the Jets and you compare it with what Tyrod Taylor did in the first half of that contest, you see the differences between a guy like him and a solid starter in Taylor. The Jets blitzed over and over again and forced Taylor to defeat tight man-coverage with his arm and getting the ball out hot, but instead he tried to run around and make things happen off script, which didn‚Äôt only end in him taking big hits but ultimately knocked him out of the game as well.     When Baker entered everything changed. He destroyed Gang Green‚Äôs blitzes by getting rid of the ball quickly and showing pocket awareness to maneuver around before dropping absolute dimes to his playmakers, who he showed trust in to win their matchups. The first overall pick has showcased clean footwork, outstanding mobility inside the pocket and tremendous command of the entire offense, making checks in no-huddle situations and deciphering opposing defenses. However, he doesn‚Äôt just have the mental aspects and fundamentals down before letting the ball go, he has made some throws that force even his biggest critics to raise their eyebrows. He has defeated tight man-coverage with Drew Brees-ish pin-point accuracy and he has delivered has some absolute ropes into tight windows. Probably his best game came versus the Panthers last Sunday. He launches several unbelievable downfield passes with a defender in almost perfect position, but with the placement of the ball those throws were basically indefensible.     Mayfield has clearly displayed the ability to diagnose a multitude of defensive looks and counter them with the understanding of where the ball needs to go, but at the same time you can not just get into the face of his pass-catchers and force him to throw those guys open ‚Äì because he will do just that. Mayfield had by far his two worst games versus the Chargers and Texans ‚Äì two teams that clearly were better from top to bottom on those days and overall as well. If you take those two performances out of the equation, he has thrown 17 touchdowns compared to just five interceptions. Obviously you have to take everything into consideration, but versus the Chargers those picks came on two great plays by Desmond King undercutting routes and all three at Houston happened because he tried to fit in some passes. So it‚Äôs not like he just misdiagnoses coverages or gets rattled by the opposition. Mayfield is just a gunslinger, who has trust in his arm and his receivers.     I have no problem with that, because he will still learn which chances he should and should not take. For every throw he attempts that simply isn‚Äôt there, there will be five others were you would think the same but somehow they get completed. Most importantly he takes care of the ball when he has his offense in scoring range, displayed by his QB rating of 115.1 in the opponents‚Äô red-zone. Since Hue Jackson and Todd Haley were fired following a week eight loss to the Steelers, Baker has completed 73.2 percent of his passes for 11 touchdowns and four picks (with three of them occurring in that Texans game), plus the Browns have won three of their five games ‚Äì which are as many wins as they had under Hue in 40 games. New offensive coordinator Freddy Kitchens has really helped out his rookie signal-caller by implementing elements of his college offense and doing an outstanding job protecting him, making him the least-pressured quarterback in the league these last few weeks.     If you made the Browns choose all over again who they would select with that number one overall pick, John Dorsey would run up to the commissioner with that card himself. Baker Mayfield brings an energy and sense of confidence this franchise hasn‚Äôt had since they were re-established almost 20 years ago. He is a perfect fit for the city of Cleveland and this fanbase deserved to finally get a guy like that. #2 Sam Darnold Darnold was really careless in particular in his meetings with the Dolphins, turning the ball over six total times For the second quarterback drafted in April it has been much more of an up-and-down season.     Right now he leads the league with 15 interceptions despite missing three games and he has thrown just 12 touchdowns compared to that. He has also completed 60 percent or more of his passes in just four of his ten starts and he has three games in the 30s in terms of quarterback rating. However, he also gave the entire Jets fan base hope with an incredible performance in the season-opening destruction of Detroit, led them to big wins over AFC playoff contenders in the Broncos and Colts while putting up 34 and 42 points respectively and he just rallied them to a win over the Bills, in a game they probably should have lost. Even his first play in a regular season game was very shaky, as he started off his career with a pick-six throwing across the field. This already showed you that he will take chances and he has tried to fit throws into tight windows on plenty of occasions.     Yet, he has also displayed that he is mentally strong enough to shake those things off and go after it the very next snap. After three straight losses in which he threw two TDs compared to four picks, the Jets put together their only consecutive wins. They followed that up with another trio of losses, in which Darnold really looked bad at times. Overall he has two games with two INTs, one with three and another one with four. I watched almost all his tapes and there were some dark moments, but you also see what I liked about him coming out of USC and he is as tough as a five-dollar steak. Darnold was really careless in particular in his meetings with the Dolphins, turning the ball over six total times. He got fooled by a defender in underneath coverage drifting one way and then coming back for the pick and once stared down his receiver on an out-breaking route, allowing the linebacker to drop all the way underneath it.     However, in week two he almost led his team back to a victory and his second interception was more on the receiver running a weak route in the end-zone and allowing the DB to beat him to the spot plus his receiving crew dropped four passes, while in week nine he had to deal with horrendous snaps for about half the game and threw his final two interceptions on fourth-and-very long, although another two were flat-out dropped by defenders. Still, even in those games you saw clutch throws on third down and good accuracy on the move. That has been the theme for large stretches of his rookie campaign ‚Äì turnovers and risky throws happening due to a lack of help from his pass-catchers. Even versus the Vikings, when he threw three interceptions, one of those throws was a wobbler because his left tackle getting pushed into him during the release and one came off the hands of his receivers on a perfectly placed slant route.     During Darnold‚Äôs three-game absence you could see how bad this roster still is. They lost all three games with Josh McCown at the helm, including a 41-10 embarrassment against the Bills, who were without their starting rookie QB as well. Darnold played far from a perfect game last Sunday at Buffalo, but he willed that team to victory. He got banged up early, went two of seven on third downs through about the first 40 minutes and made a really stupid decision on his interception, just tossing it up there scrambling all the way to the sideline and expecting a receiver to come up with it after turning his out-route upfield. But he also delivered some absolutely perfect balls right in stride on corner, deep out and fade routes that kept his team alive and made the play of the game on third-and-goal when he was flushed right and reversed all the way across the field before finding Robby Anderson in the end-zone.     He completed another big one on a go-route to Anderson, where he freezed the middle safety for a second and then dropped it right into the bucket of his receivers versus the Bills‚Äô top corner Tre‚ÄôDavious White, which set up the game-winning touchdown. The third overall pick has definitely had his struggles as a rookie, but a lot of that had to do with the team around him. Darnold has no true, dependable playmakers around him outside of Anderson and to a lesser degree Quincy Enunwa and his offensive line has been suspect at times. I loved what I saw from him in the preseason, diagnosing defenses pre-snap and then not panicking when they tried to confuse him, but rather moving on to his next read and delivering strikes. I am also encouraged by just four fumbles on the year, because I thought his biggest concern in college was the lack of ball-security while moving around.     Say what you want, but I still believe in this kid being the Jets‚Äô savior, because I think he has the perseverance to recover from bad plays as well as one bad season, and let‚Äôs not forget he only turned 21 a week after he was drafted. He can make those standard plays that keep offenses on schedule, but he can also create when nothing is there and deliver accurately outside the pocket. They need to load up with pieces around him to help their future out. #3 Josh Allen Enter caption     I had Allen as my number five quarterback and it was not as much due to the inconsistent accuracy that draft experts worried about, but rather because of poor pocket presence. I can make a quarterback throw every route and read every concept a million times at practice, but having a feel for when and how to move inside the pocket while maintaining a throwing posture and keeping your eyes downfield is much harder to teach, because it is somewhat of an innate ability. Far too often I saw Allen scramble and make bad decisions instead of maximizing the space he had in the pocket to make throws down the field or worst case go down and live for another play. The advantage he had over all those other guys I had ranked ahead of him was the fact that he had experience in a pro-style offense and his rare physical traits were off the charts. So far I think those are what really have stood out, while his mental game is starting to come along.     When I started watching Allen‚Äôs tape at Wyoming I saw a young Roethlisberger body-wise, but through his first nine games he has looked more like Cam Newton as a runner. He is now up to 490 yards and five TDs on the ground, with 401 of those coming off scrambles.  I remember a week three game versus the Vikings where the Bills pulled off the upset in a beatdown at Minnesota behind a ferocious defense and a Josh Allen killing the Vikes taking off multiple times.  Anthony Barr seemed to be Allen‚Äôs personal target, because he outran, trucked and even hurdled the 6‚Äô5‚Äù linebacker on separate plays.  Then in week 13 it was the Dolphins linebacker Kiko Alonso, who he once spun around like a ballerina and then beat to the edge on another scramble after he made a D-tackle completely whiff on like a dead-leg back juke.  I knew he was a tremendous athlete, but this guy is on another level. There‚Äôs only so many guys with the speed to run past linebackers one play and then have the size to run over them the very next.     In one of the crazier statistics I‚Äôve ever seen, Allen just broke Michael Vick‚Äôs record of rushing yards in a three-game span with 335. When you run like that fumbles occur, but only two times he has put the ball on the turf and saw the defense recover.  Through nine starts Allen is 26th among all players in the league with 29 runs resulting in first downs despite just 66 carries. Only Mitch Trubisky has turned a higher percentage of his runs into first downs among player with over 50 attempts, as 43.9 percent of Allen‚Äôs rushes have resulted in fresh sets of downs.  He has produced 19 runs of 10+ yards and has made it past the marker ten of his 17 rush attempts on third down (58.8 percent). All of that while missing four games with a banged up shoulder.  The Bills are a top ten rushing offense, but without their QB‚Äôs production only three teams would rank below them in total yards and they would be dead-last in yards per carry. You would like to see him take a few less shots, but he is one of the very few who has the frame to sustain that, plus he is starting to slide more.     In addition to what he does on the ground, he has a howitzer of an arm and he is starting to make some big plays with it.  Allen‚Äôs overall numbers are definitely not where you‚Äôd like them to be, as he is completing just 52.4 percent of his passes with five touchdowns compared to nine interceptions and a QB rating of 62.8, but a lot of that has to do with the situations he is put in. I already mentioned their poor rushing numbers if their QB doesn‚Äôt run it himself, as all other ball-carrier average 3.63 yards per carry ‚Äì less than half of what he does ‚Äì but the Bills also simply don‚Äôt have the playmakers to make things happen with the ball in their hands.  They are second-to-last ahead of only the Cardinals in yards after catch with a little over 1000 and even though I didn‚Äôt track the numbers, I can tell you that there are very few if any teams that have faced third & 10+ more often than Buffalo.     When watching the Bills rookie QB on tape the one thing that jumps out to you is his arm strength. I think Patrick Mahomes and Allen are about in the same ball park ‚Äì and I‚Äôm not sure if anybody else parks there.  He can be late on some throws and still get them to his targets before the defender has a chance to make a play on it because he just puts lasers out there, while also threatening any defense to go over the top.  His accuracy might not be ideal all the time, especially on easy dumpoffs and other underneath completions, but he is clearly precise enough to shred defenses. Even though he has put up crazy numbers on the ground since returning from injury, I have been very intrigued with some of the throws he has made during that stretch.  Versus the Dolphins in week 13 he launched two stupendous rockets to Zay Jones ‚Äì one running to his right and hitting hum at the end-line for a touchdown and then another one out of his own end-zone scrambling left and hitting Jones at the sideline on third and 12 for an extra ten off the wrong foot.      Last week against the Jets he was backed up inside his own ten and didn‚Äôt let the safety bait him into a risky throw on a go-route against a muddy coverage look, but instead stayed patient and drilled a shallow post that the receiver sat down over the middle, plus later he connected on a beautiful back-shoulder pass with a slot receiver running an inside fade route versus cover-one. While he made a stupid decision scrambling to his right and just throwing up a prayer while getting hit out of bounds ‚Äì which was intercepted ‚Äì I came away really impressed by the rookie.  On their go-ahead drive he almost put them ahead by a touchdown on a perfect pass to his receiver running a corner route towards the pylon on a designed rollout, before settling for three, which didn‚Äôt prove to be enough.  I don‚Äôt think anybody in this class nearly has the upside Allen presents. He can kill defenses as a scrambler against man-coverages and when he gets confused by coverage looks, he can throw off either leg and fading away better than a lot of guys can from a clean pocket and he is starting to make big-time throws from the pocket.      Obviously I‚Äôd like him to maintain a normal throwing posture more instead of moving East and West, but I take it for now. The Bills O-line has been sub-par, allowing Allen to be sacked on 10.3 percent of his dropbacks.  The only player on that offense to make anything happen with the ball in his hands recently has been Isaiah McKenzie and he only just started the first game of his career.  Not only are the Bills 3-6 with Allen as their starter, as crazy as it sounds when you look at his passing numbers, adding his rushing, Allen actually owns the highest QBR among all rookie quarterbacks so far. #4 Josh Rosen Rosen actually delivered some bullets to move the offence just outside field goal range     By far the most frustration for any offense and their rookie quarterback has taken place in Arizona. The Cardinals brought in career journeymen Sam Bradford and Mike Glennon in March before even having any idea about what could happen in the draft.  Sitting at number 10 overall with the Browns, Giants, Jets, Broncos and Bills all ahead of them and little draft capital to move up, there was a good chance that this team could have ended up with none of the four favorite quarterbacks.  However, with the Giants deciding to stick with Eli Manning for another year and the Broncos going with edge rusher over signal-caller after having signed Case Keenum to a deal, Arizona didn‚Äôt have to do anything but sit there and have UCLA star-quarterback Josh Rosen fall right into their lap.  However, they decided to start the season off with Bradford and that lasted less than three full games before they trotted their rookie out there.     In a very peculiar spot, down 16-14 with about four minutes left against the league‚Äôs number one defense in the Bears, Rosen saw his first regular season action and was immediately asked to lead them to a victory from behind.  Rosen actually delivered some bullets to move the offence just outside field goal range, but was intercepted on a good fourth down attempt. The week after that he was named the starter and he hasn‚Äôt left the lineup ever since.  In his first start ever against the Seahawks I saw some impressive stuff from the rook, delivering supremely accurate passes on all three levels, just threading the needle on a multitude of them, even though a bunch of them were dropped, knocked away late or ruled incomplete due to one foot not coming down in bounds.  He came up big for them on crucial situations and the only thing that held the Cardinals back from winning that game was their own coaching staff not allowing their young signal-caller to get it done late with his arm, but instead deciding to run the ball three straight times around the opposing 30-yard line and ultimately missing the go-ahead field goal, even though it was the rookie that led them down there.     The week after that Rosen got his first career win versus the 49ers and even though the numbers might not have been that good, he took good care of the ball and hooked up with rookie teammate Christian Kirk for a huge 75-yard touchdown for the game‚Äôs first score.  Over the next two games, the team took a huge bump, as they lost by ten at the Vikings and were blown out 45-10 at home by the Broncos.  Rosen threw just one touchdown and four picks during that stretch, but I thought the numbers didn‚Äôt really tell the truth. Especially against the Broncos I thought he played much better than those horrendous stats indicated.  On his first pick-six the ball was batted up in the air at the line and on the second one the wideout inexplicably just stopped running on a slant route. Outside of that third one in the fourth quarter, when he just tried to force a big play to Kirk at last, Rosen was on time and target on curls, hooks, comebacks and other timing-based routes.      Following that demolition the Cardinals finally decided to fire their Offensive Coordinator Mike McCoy. It was not just Sam Bradford early on that willingly checked the ball down to his backs over and over again without even trying to look downfield, but also McCoy‚Äôs conservative play-calling that hindered his rookie quarterback.  The run design lacked creativity in a big way, being limited to simple dive and ISO plays for the most part, there were no vertical stretches of the defense and he just could not find ways to put the ball into the hands of the few of playmakers they had in space.  Moreover, the supporting cast for the Cards might have been even worse than the Bills‚Äô. They are dead-last in yards after the catch, barely cracking the 1000-yard mark. In comparison to that ‚Äì the 49ers have almost double that amount despite playing with a backup QB and limitations at the skill spots as well.      However what really stands out about McCoy‚Äôs stint in Arizona is the way he could not put his best player David Johnson in position to succeed. Before DJ missed almost all of last season, there might have been two guys I would have taken above him if you made me choose a running back.  Yet, in seven games under their ex-OC he was limited to 72 yards from scrimmage per game on an average of just 18 touches, giving him less than four yards per touch. This has also led to the lowest number in time of possession at 26:17 a game, as they have gained an average of just 4.6 first downs on the ground. While the offense has improved to some degree under Byron Leftwich, I think it is almost unfair to evaluate Rosen like the other guys, because not only the players around him on offense but also the play-calling for large stretches has been so incredibly bad.      He is ranked among the bottom five in percentage of third downs converted via the pass, but he has faced a large amount of third-and-long situations. When it was third-and-eight or more he has completed 28.9 percent of his passes.  I still love Rosen‚Äôs touch and internal confidence. He is extremely smart and not afraid to let it rip. If you look beyond the numbers and win totals, even though they won at Lambeau field two weeks ago, you see some franchise quarterback traits.  The organization just needs to surround Rosen with more playmakers and make things easier with coordinator help. #5 Lamar Jackson Early on Jackson was used as a gadget player, coming in to run zone-reads, designed quarterback keeps, throw a couple of passes or just be a decoy for opposing defences     I truly believe Lamar Jackson is the closest thing we have had seen to Michael Vick since his days with the Falcons and Eagles.  When the Ravens decided to move back up into the first round of April‚Äôs draft to select the former Heisman trophy winner with the 32nd pick, the organization made a structural and philosophical decision, but they also knew they still had Joe Flacco on their books for this season and only then they could make the call on what they will do going forward.  Early on Jackson was used as a gadget player, coming in to run zone-reads, designed quarterback keeps, throw a couple of passes or just be a decoy for opposing defenses. When it was announced that Flacco would miss the first game after their by week, the rookie stepped into the starting lineup.  Entering at a 4-5 record, Baltimore only now lost their first game with the rookie as the starter ‚Äì and that came by three points to the top-seeded Chiefs following a 3-0 start to Lamar‚Äôs career.      With Flacco back to fully participating and the Ravens deciding to go with Jackson against Tampa Bay this weekend, a new era has officially started in Charm City. The biggest difference with Jackson in the starting lineup has been the improvement of the rushing attack. I crunched the numbers and the team‚Äôs difference between their attempts, yards and averages are astonishing.  Through the first nine weeks with Flacco under center, the Ravens on average ran the ball 27 times a game for 103.8 yards, giving them an average of 3.85 yards per carry.  These last four games with the rookie taking over however, they are running the ball 46 times for 228.5 yards and 4.97 yards per carry.  That comparison is just absolutely ridiculous, giving Baltimore the league‚Äôs best marks in totals and attempts, while being right up there with the elite in average yards as well despite that run-pass ratio.  Obviously a lot of that has to do with the rookie quarterback amassing 475 total yards on the ground himself on 5.0 yards a clip and surpassing 70 yards in every game as a starter, but this goes beyond his numbers alternating their overall production.     The threat of Jackson pulling the ball on zone-reads or simply booting the other way off handoffs is so frightening for defenses that it hurts their backside help on running plays on many occasions.  Not only do they obviously have to keep the last man at the line of scrimmage leverage outside the quarterback to force him to hand the ball off, a lot of times that backside linebacker can not flow with the play whatsoever and this allows even easier cutback opportunities for the Ravens‚Äô backs compared to if that guy just overran the play.  Fellow rookie running back Gus Edwards only entered the scene once Jackson took over and while I don‚Äôt want to take any credit away from him, his 95.5 rushing yards a game and five yards per attempt and Kenneth Dixon‚Äôs six yards per rush these last two weeks have a lot to do with who is running the play-fakes.      As far as straight-line speed goes I don‚Äôt think anybody is up to par with Jackson and he just seems to freeze defenders when he takes off. Obviously he will need to protect his body better going forward, but he will learn that. People who think Jackson just wants to scramble haven‚Äôt watched the tape, because 418 of his 475 yards have come on designed runs. He is looking to throw the ball and sometimes you feel like he almost should take off with his athletic ability.  The overall passing numbers are pedestrian at 25 attempts for 150 yards per game and four touchdowns compared to three interceptions.  Outside of a big run-and-catch play to fellow rookie tight-end Mark Andrews, Jackson hasn‚Äôt really provided the element of the deep passing attack, but he has done enough through the air to keep his offense on schedule.  The rookie out of Louisville might not have the fastball some of these other guys on the list have, but he has a whippy arm and he is comfortable throwing it on the run.      Jackson has come up with big, timely completions from the pocket as well as off schedule at the end of halves and on third downs. What is very unique about him is how we can move defenders one way with how he moves and then comes back the other way to one of his pass-catchers. Jackson still has to work a lot on his ability to pick defenses apart from the pocket, as he prefers to manipulate defenders with his movement to create clear looks for himself and as of right now he has the second-lowest adjusted completion percentage among all starting quarterbacks, but he just plays winning football.  Through four games, the rookie QB is 21 of 44 converting with his arm and legs on third and fourth downs (47.7%) and when the yardage to gain is at five or under, he is 13 of 20. Obviously he went against a few below-average defenses in the Bengals, Raiders, Falcons and Chiefs, but he also came through in the clutch for his team and battled it out with MVP front-runner Patrick Mahomes at a hostile place in Arrowhead.  With him in the lineup, Baltimore can be the team that they are built to be ‚Äì which means controlling the clock with their ground game, as they average 35:52 minutes in terms of time of possession, and get after it with a rested defense.

The former Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator took on the job just days after taking his team to the Super Bowl. After working in a variety of positions on defense, he now takes his first head coaching job.  It might be a good fit, but he was not the only option available. There were reports that Arizona were trying to get Sean Payton before he chose the Denver Broncos. They interviewed other candidates as well who might have taken this job.        While we wish Gannon all the best, there are a couple of issues that stand out. An example being that the Eagles gave up 38 points in the Super Bowl and suffered some lapses in concentration during the final games of the regular season. Furthermore, with Kyler Murray's situation, maybe an offensive coach might have been better.           Considering such factors, we look at some other candidates the Cardinals could have chosen. Who else would have made sense for the Cardinals? #1 - Dan Quinn, DC, Dallas Cowboys NFC Divisional Playoffs - Dallas Cowboys v San Francisco 49ers     If the Cardinals wanted a defensive-minded coach like Jonathan Gannon, they could have looked at Dan Quinn instead. While Philadelphia allowed fewer yards per game, their points allowed was not as good as that of the Dallas Cowboys. While the difference was marginal (with the Eagles defense allowing 20.2 points per game compared to 20.1 for Dallas), Philadelphia was playing with Jalen Hurts, who did not turn the ball over with the frequency of Dak Prescott. That could have been a convincing argument to hire Quinn. However, he also has a head coaching pedigree, something Gannon does not. He took the Atlanta Falcons to the Super Bowl. At the time, he ensured that even though he came from a defensive standpoint, the offense flourished with Matt Ryan being named league MVP that season. Considering the situation in Arizona, where they need a coach who can develop Kyler Murray, this might have been a very good fit.     #2 - Eric Bienemy, OC, Kansas City Chiefs If one was looking for an offensive play-caller who has the resume to beat anybody else, it would have to be Eric Bienemy at the moment. He has been with the Kansas City Chiefs since 2018 and has won two Super Bowls. Bienemy has worked magic with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce and ensured that their offense flourishes even without Tyreek Hill this season. HBCU Premier Sports@HBCUSports1Another has passed, Chiefs Offensive Coordinator Eric Bienemy yet to Land NFL Head Coaching Job* 2022 offenese #1 won Super Bowl * 2021 offense #3 AFC Champ Gm* 2020 offense #1 Super Bowl * 2019 offense #6 won Super Bowl * 2018 offense #1 AFC Champ Gm762192 The issue with him is that he is always overshadowed by Andy Reid. The veteran coach gets credit for the play calls. However, considering that the Cardinals desperately need to figure out how best to use Kyler Murray, an offensive-minded coach like him could have been an asset.     #3 - Brian Flores, DC, Minnesota Vikings Pittsburgh Steelers v Miami Dolphins Brian Flores is the newly minted defensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings. He spent a year in Pittsburgh after his departure from the Miami Dolphins, but he now has a position in Minnesota. He was reported to have been interviewed for the job in Arizona. While Jonathan Gannon has done an amazing job this season, he does not have head coaching experience. That is something Flores had with Miami. He also had the job of handling a young quarterback there, who he had to mentor and help grow. He has been in that situation before as a head coach and might have risen to the occasion with the Cardinals.     #4 - Mike Kafka, OC, New York Giants In this year's NFL honors, the Coach of the Year award went to Brian Daboll. Not many would argue with it given where the New York Giants were a year ago compared to them making it to the Divisional round this season. One of the main reasons for their improvement was the increased maturity shown by quarterback Daniel Jones. Much of that credit should go to Mike Kafka, who oversees the offense there. felix üáµüá∑@FootballPapiNews coming through as I'm at work: Jonthan Gannon getting the Cardinals job means that #Giants OC Mike Kafka returns and gets another year with Daniel Jones. Exciting news that the NFL Coach of the Year gets to retain two of his biggest staff members. #TogetherBlue DJ gets‚Ä¶ twitter.com/i/web/status/1‚Ä¶     He has experience mentoring Patrick Mahomes in his initial years and has now turned Daniel Jones from being a near-bust to a good quarterback. This is someone who could have been just the right person to take Kyler Murray's development to the next stage. #5 - Steve Wilks, DC, San Francisco 49ers Denver Broncos v Carolina Panthers One can see why the Cardinals went with a defensive coach like Gannon. Despite needing someone to cajole the best performance out of Kyler Murray, another worry was their defense. They shipped 26.2 points per game, the second-worst in the league behind the Chicago Bears.     When confronted with this dual problem, the best person based on current record should have been Steve Wilks. He was the interim head coach of the Carolina Panthers and turned around a team that had looked hopeless all season. He suddenly got Sam Darnold looking like a real quarterback. He also tightened the defense and improved the run game. He showed his all-round caliber. The obvious issue with this choice would have been his previous history with the Cardinals, where he finished 3-13 in the 2018 season. However, that was before Kyler Murray was drafted and he had to manage with Mike Glennon and Josh Rosen.Considering his familiarity with the Cardinals and given both he and the team were in a different situation then, this could have been a possible, albeit unusual, option.     "", 'Redditors shocked over Deshaun Watson\'s 11-game suspension  Deshaun Watson was initially given a six-game suspension but the NFL appealed the ruling. Five more games were added to the Cleveland Browns quarterback‚Äôs suspension, making it 11 games and a five million-dollar fine. This followed an NFL investigation into 24 accusations of sexual misconduct levied against Watson.  Some NFL fans are not too happy about the suspension and the fine as a ruling. Redditors shared their thoughts on the quarterback and the ruling itself.        Some on Reddit went after the Browns quarterback for his actions in their response to the ruling, saying he\'s a predator:              Warning: NSFW language         Warning: NSFW language                 Other Redditors placed the blame squarely on the league for the Cleveland quarterback\'s suspension and discussed his apology:                     Tony Buzbee, the attorney for the plaintiffs, shared his disapproval of the ruling, saying: ‚ÄúBy settling this matter the way he has, Roger Goodell has proven one of two things: either his recent rhetoric was utter baloney, or his bark is much worse than his bite."" Jake Trotter@Jake_TrotterStatement from Tony Buzbee, the attorney for the women who sued Watson:36078     After the 11-game suspension came out, Deshaun Watson spoke to the media. He said that he\'s innocent, but wants to push forward with his career: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been able to stand on my innocence and always said I never assaulted or disrespected anyone but at the same point I have to continue to push forward with my life and career.‚Äù    However, he said in an interview before the 11-game suspension was revealed that he was sorry to the women impacted:     ""I want to say that I\'m truly sorry to all of the women that I have impacted in this situation.""    The quarterback added that his decisions placed him in the position he was in: ""The decisions that I made in my life that put me in this position I would definitely like to have back. But I want to continue to move forward and grow and learn and show that I am a true person of character and I am going to keep pushing forward.""     It seems the 26-year-old apologized and maintained his innocence within a span of days. Watson was accused by over two dozen women who accused him of sexual assault and sexual harassment during massage sessions. Now that we know that he\'ll be playing this season, attention is now focused on his return in Week 13.  Deshaun Watson returns to the Cleveland Browns in Week 13 against the Houston Texans Deshaun Watson at Cleveland Browns Training Camp     Remarkably, Deshaun Watson will return in Week 13 against his former team, the Houston Texans. The question is whether the Browns will still be in playoff contention by that point. They are set to start Jacoby Brissett for the duration of Watson\'s suspension. He will be backed up by Josh Rosen and Joshua Dobbs. Brissett is definitely good enough to win a few games for the Browns, who will likely lean heavily on their running game. To have any chance of making the postseason, they will need Brissett to win at least six games. From there, Watson will have to hit the ground running upon his return. Watson had a poor performance in his preseason debut against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He completed one pass for seven yards from five attempts. It will be interesting to see if so much time away from the field will be an issue for him when he returns.

', ""NFL 2018: Ranking the new QB situations for 2018 season  The 2018 off-season began even before the Super Bowl 52 was played. The Washington Redskins agreed to trade for quarterback Alex Smith from the Kansas City Chiefs in late January thus resetting the QB market even before the season ended. Two teams already had two new quarterbacks before the Eagles could beat out the defending champions in February.  The trade freed the embattled ex-Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins to sign with the Minnesota Vikings in Free agency. The Vikings, who made it to the NFC Championship game, had three starting-caliber quarterbacks and let them all hit the free agency and signed Cousins to a first-ever full guaranteed contract.        Weeks prior to the start of free agency it was obvious that the Cousins-Vikings marriage is inevitable, which prompted the MVP of Vikings season Case Keenum to struck a deal with Denver Broncos even before the Cousins deal was finalized. This Keenum deal started the domino effect with many teams that are in the QB market started making deals.           Cleveland Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor from the Buffalo Bills, one of many trades they made this offseason. Arizona Cardinals signed Sam Bradford, New York Jets Signed Teddy Bridgewater and then traded him to the New Orleans Saints after an amazing preseason. AJ McCarron signed with the Bills and got beat out by rookie Josh Allen to become the starter which prompted the Bills to trade him to Oakland. Speaking of rookies, the 2018 draft had as many as Five QBs taken in round 1. By Week 4, four of the 5 are starting and the fifth QB is already seeing some game action in trick plays.     Including both the Veterans and Rookies, there are as many as Eight teams who had new Quarterbacks starting for them this year. Let's take a look at how these QBs fared so far with their new teams. Let's start with a Bonus player, the man who took the league by surprise and then crash landed in week 4:  BONUS: Ryan Fitzpatrick (2-2)  Oh, where to start. When I first started to think about this article after week 2, I had him competing for the number 1 spot with the current number 1 and then week 4 happened and the head coach Dirk Koetter has announced that Jameis Winston will be starting after the week 5 bye.     Since, FitzMagic is just a placeholder for Winston, who was serving his 3-game suspension, I decided not to include him in the rankings but thought he deserved a shout-out for his performance through the first three weeks. He went 2-2 in his starts when no one expected him to be anything better than 1-3. He faced three playoff teams from last year and went 2-1 in those games and came close to being 3-0 while trying to make an epic comeback against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 3. He posted 400 yards in each of his first three games, an NFL record. But week 4 proved why Fitzpatrick is who he is, a journeyman quarterback. The four-game stretch should help him get more money in the next offseason and will be a highly paid backup QB. #8 Josh Rosen/Sam Bradford, Arizona Cardinals (0-4)      Two teams have already started two quarterbacks who were not on their roster last season, one of them is Arizona Cardinals. Cardinals, who saw both their quarterback and head coach retire after last season had a complete overhaul in coaching and QB room. The added three quarterbacks including Mike Glennon. Sam Bradford, who is coming off injuries, signed a 1 year 20 million dollar contract and became a presumed starter. But, the Cardinals are off to a terrible start losing out in all the three starts prompting the change to go with the rookie Josh Rosen. Bradford in his three starts completed 62.5% of his passes for 400 yards and two touchdowns. But, he also had four INTs to his name. Bradford, couldn't move the ball well under Mike McCoy's game plan. He struggled in the first 2 games where the offense only scored 6 points in total. He started off well in the Week 3 matchup against the Chicago Bears where he tossed two TDs to start the game, but then couldn't find the momentum in the rest of the game which paved the way for the rookies Josh Rosen to come in the fourth quarter and try to win the game which was a very close contest.         Rosen was named starter for week 4 and quietly had an impressive debut. Rosen probably threw for only 180 yards but kept the Cardinals in the game without making any stupid mistakes. Cardinals eventually lost to the Russell Wilson's Seahawks, but had a glimpse of their bright future. The Cardinals running game needs to be picked up. The O-line has been one of the worst in the league, which handcuffed one of the elite tailbacks in David Johnson.     This Cardinals offense reminds me of 2016 Rams team which made Todd Gurley, Jared Goff and Case Keenum do nothing. This Cardinals offense is doing the same to David Johnson, Josh Rosen and Larry Fitzerald. Look for a coaching change to come this off season even though it is the first season as a head coach for Steve Wilks, at the very least the OC needs to be changed. With the correct play caller, this offense is capable of some high flying action ala Chiefs, Rams and the Texans. #7 Josh Allen/Nathan Peterman, Buffalo Bills (1-3)      Buffalo Bills had one of the strangest QB competition in NFL this offseason. They had three quarterbacks in the battle for the starting spot during the training camp. All thought that it would be AJ McCarron but instead as the preseason approached McCarron became third stringer and expendable, thus his trade to Raiders. The Bill surprisingly announced Nathan Peterman over the rookie Josh Allen as the starter for week 1, but Peterman repeated his first start performance from last year when he threw for 5 picks. He threw 2 picks and scored nothing, which led for the rookie Josh Allen to take the reigns. Allen in his three starts the next three weeks, completed only 53.4% of passes throwing just two touchdowns with four picks. His best game came in week 3 when the Buffalo Bills stunned the world by beating the Minnesota Vikings. Allen had three total TDs, 2 of them coming on the ground, showing off his athleticism in that game. But, he came back to earth in week 4, throwing 2 picks against an average Packers defense.     Allen, as expected, is raw and playing like a typical rookie. In an ideal scenario, he could use a redshirt season before taking over the reigns like Patrick Mahomes, but he did not have the luxury of learning under someone like Alex Smith, instead, the situation has thrust him into starting role early. He is going to have some growing pains but if week 3 is any indication he is going to be big in long term. #6 Baker Mayfield/Tyrod Taylor, Cleveland Browns (1-2-1)      This is the second team in the list that already had two starters who were not on the roster last season. The Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor during the offseason. A month later the Browns picked Baker Mayfield with the number 1 overall pick. Mayfield was supposed to be redshirted this season with Taylor holding the place for the year at least until the Browns are out of Playoff contention. But with Taylor's concussion in Week 3 Thursday Night matchup against the Jets, Mayfield came in late second quarter and helped Browns mount the comeback and give the franchise its first win in 17 games. Browns had a great start to the season, mostly thanks to the defense which stifled Ben Roethlisberger in Week 1. Drew Brees also had a tough time playing against this defense. Browns started 0-1-1 in the first two weeks and entered week 3 as favorites for the first time in almost two seasons.     Tyrod Taylor apart from a couple of plays had a tough start to his Browns tenure. That bad form continued in week 3. The first half of that game was unwatchable with Tyrod under center. But, when Mayfield came into the game, the dynamics changed. Browns offense is fun to watch after a very long time, He made the plays that Tyrod Taylor would hesitate to do.     Mayfield brought the life back into the Browns fans. The stadium was lit during the Second Half. That Second Half started a new era in Cleveland Football History. Mayfield was named a starter for Week 4 and beyond as expected. On his first start though Mayfield came back to earth against the Oakland Raiders.     Mayfield threw for two touchdowns but also had four turnovers which resulted in 21 Raiders points. Mayfield showed off his athletic skills, but also showed it was premature to make him a HOF player after that amazing second half in week 3. It is going to be interesting to see how the Browns and Mayfield will continue the rest of the way in all of a sudden new look AFC North that has Steelers tied at the bottom of the table instead of the top. #5 Sam Darnold, New York Jets (1-3)      Darnold was the only rookie quarterback who was named the starting quarterback prior to week 1. He had to earn the job in a battle with Teddy Bridgewater. Both Darnold and Bridgewater had a good preseason leading the Jets to trade Bridgewater to Saints and announce Darnold as a starter. Unlike other rookies, Darnold had an impressive start to his career. He completed 76% of his passes for 198 yards, 2 TDs and a pick with an impressive 116.8 rating. But after that, he came back crashing to earth. He had 4 more INTs to only 2 TDs in the remaining three games.         Darnold had his first career game without any interception in week 4 against a very good Jacksonville Jaguars defense. That should be considered a minor victory for a rookie QB who is struggling after a strong start. Unlike other quarterbacks, Darnold isn't surrounded by high flying talent. His receivers and the running backs are well below league average. In order to succeed long-term, the Jets need to provide weapons around him as the Bears did with Mitchell Trubisky this year, which helped him go off in week 4. Quincy Enunwa and the receivers need to step up and help the rookie QB to have any shot this year. Patriots, who had a slow start are getting back their groove right in time with Julian Edelman returning from his suspension. Jets will be facing a tough Denver defense in week 5. if Darnold could escape that game without a Turnover, they could have a very good chance to escape with a W. He could take some pointer from his veteran backup and mentor Josh McCown.     #4 Alex Smith, Washington Redskins (2-1)  Alex Smith has been his typical self to start the 2018 season with his new team the Washington Redskins. He has a completed nearly 70% of his passes and scored 4 Touchdowns with a pick and a 2-1 record. That is a typical Alex Smith stat line. Smith had a good start for his redskins tenure against the Cardinals, where he threw for 255 yards and a couple of TDs. But, in week 2 against a mediocre Colts defense Smith couldn't find the endzone even though completing nearly 72% of his passes. He and the Redskins bounced back in week 3 against the Packers where he outplayed Rodgers to upset the Packers.     Smith success correlates with the success of the running game. in the two wins, the Redskins new running back, Adrian Peterson rushed for nearly hundred yards and has scored a TD at least once, in the loss against the Colts he rushed 11 times for just 20 yards. Smith is one of those QBs who needs all the dominoes around him should work efficiently to find the success. He does not commit any back-breaking mistakes but he does not even get you out of the gate if fallen behind. NFC East is vulnerable right now and Redskins sit on top of the division even with their bye on week 4. The one difference between the Chiefs and the Redskins is that they lack that dynamic pass catcher that could help a QB out. Jordan Reed had some success in the wins but Jamison Crowder has yet to find the rhythm. It will be interesting to see if Smith can help out the Redskins to remain on top of a very close NFC East race as he did with the Chiefs the past few Seasons.     #3 Case Keenum, Denver Broncos (2-2)  Case Keenum, an undrafted free agent out of the University of Houston, had one of the most unprecedented journeys to become the starting quarterback of Denver Broncos. After his amazing career year in 2017 with the Vikings, Keenum signed a 2 year 36 million dollar contract with the Broncos. But, so far Keenum was not able to replicate the kind of success he had last season. Keenum had a total of 7 INTs in 2017 season has already thrown for 6 so far in four games and just tossing three touchdowns. Keenum's decision making at times seem erratic. He is trying to do more than what the defenses are giving him.     Even with his erratic play Keenum found some early success in the first two weeks by having two clutch game winning drives, which Broncos did not have last season. He almost had a third game winning drive on the MNF, week 4 against the Chiefs. He overthrew a wide open Demaryius Thomas which could have resulted in a game winning TD. In the next play he did connect to the rookie Courtland Sutton in an old-school hook and ladder play call.         Keenum, just like Smith is a game manager who needs to have a better player all around him. He has a solid running game with the two rookies, Royce Freeman and Phillip Lindsay sharing the work load, but the receivers apart from Emmanuel Sanders haven't really stepped up. The reason for having Keenum just a tick above the Last year with Vikings Keenum had Thielen and Diggs who had some amazing catches that helped out Keenum. Keenum knows that Demaryius Thomas is no longer in that elite group and need to be more careful forcing the ball into the tight coverage. The reason I have Keenum a tick above Alex Smith is that of his Clutch performance in weeks 1 and 2 and his NFC Championship game appearance just a few months back. I still think that Keenum is an upgrade to what Denver had last season and could help them have a fighting chance to at least grab the Wildcard spot in the playoffs.     There is no panic yet in Denver, there is a lot of season left and with no viable back up option left this will be Keenum's Season. If he can clean up the turnovers, this Denver team could be in hunt for a playoff spot in December. #2 Kirk Cousins, Minnesota Vikings (1-2-1)  Kirk Cousins, signed a monster contract with the Minnesota Vikings this offseason. After reaching the NFC Championship game a year ago with Keenum under center, the expectations very sky high for the Vikings fans. Some even considered this a Superbowl or bust move.     If indeed it is a Superbowl or bust move, the Vikings are off to a terrible start. They opened the season with a W against the 49ers but tied it up in week 2 with the Packers thanks to some head-scratching roughing the passer penalties. But the real stunner cam in Week 3 when Vikings and Cousins looked almost clueless against a bad Buffalo Bills team who scored a combined 23 points in the remaining three games. Cousins was shutout for three quarters, he had a couple of strip sacks an INT and it was late in the 4Q that he tossed a TD almost in garbage time. Apart from that one week, Cousins was his usual self he completed nearly 70% of his passes, tossing 10 Touchdowns and just 2 picks. He has 1,387 yards in just 4 games and yet the record is 1-2-1 record.         Cousins tenure so far remained same like his Redskins tenure where he played very well when was not pressured too much. But, when pressured his performance goes down. In 2018 so far his rating when the pocket is clean was 112.2, but when he is pressured it dramatically drops down to 89.8. Cousins even brought his fumbling issue from Redskins to Vikings, in which he is second most to fumble the ball since 2015. The Vikings O-line performance has been masked by Keenum's athleticism last season of avoiding the sacks, which Cousins clearly lacks. If Vikings need to find success with Cousins under center they need to provide a clean pocket and give him time to make the plays that Keenum couldn't have done last season. The NFC North looks very interesting with Chicago Bears on Top with Packer right next to them. If the Vikings need to be in the Playoffs in a very tough NFC they need to keep teh pocket clean for Cousins.     #1 Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs (4-0)  Patrick Mahomes is not a new player that was signed or added this offseason but he is the new starter for the Kansas City Chiefs after they traded Alex Smith to the Redskins. Mahomes did start in week 17 of last season but still, this is the first season as a full-fledged starter and thought he should be in this conversation. After the kind of start he had, he certainly should be.     Mahomes had one of the best starts since the Peyton Manning's record-breaking 2013 season. Mahomes even broke the Manning's record of 12 total touchdowns by tossing 13 through weeks 1-3. During the first three weeks, Mahomes was off to fast starts putting up 20+ points to start the game and make the opposing offenses play catchup to the Chiefs. The real test for Mahomes came in week 4 against a very good Broncos defense in a very rowdy Denver environment in Monday Night Prime-time slot. He had a slow start where Denver's defense had his number during the first three quarters. But he remained calm and made some timely passes in the fourth quarter resulting in one of the most thrilling matches in 2018 season so far.         The most amazing fact about Mahomes' performance so far in 2018 is that he has yet to throw an interception. In his four starts this season he has 15 touchdowns and zero picks. This INT-less streak should be attributed to his redshirt year in 2017 under Alex Smith. There is no better player to learn from how to remain interception-free. Mahomes performance so far is a reminiscence of Deshaun Watson's performance for Houston Texans last season. Mahomes is bound to be regressed in coming weeks, which could happen very well in week 5 against a very strong Jaguars defense, who allowed only a total of 4 touchdowns. The sky is the limit for Mahomes and this Kansas City offense. All they could ask for is the defense to play some average level play who currently are last in passing yards allowed. If the defense is not improved, a very good offensive season could very well be ruined come January. Mahomes, distanced himself from others atop of the MVP race, not a bad way to kickoff your first full season as a starting NFL QB. Let's hope the football gods spare Mahomes that bit the likes of Wentz and Watson last season during their own MVP campaigns.

Blount's stay in Pittsburgh lasted less than a season.     #2 ‚Äì Ryan Mallet, Houston Texans, October 2015 Houston Texans quarterback Ryan Mallet After a series of embarrassing events, Ryan Mallet blew his chance to establish himself as the Houston Texans starting quarterback. After being acquired by trade from the New England Patriots, head coach Bill O'Brien installed Mallet as the starter for the 2014 season but the QB only played three games before a torn pectoral muscle ended his season. Brian Hoyer beat Mallet for the starter's jersey during the 2015 preseason, and a day after the announcement, Mallet missed practice after sleeping through his alarm in scenes amplified by NFL Films' hit show Hard Knocks. The comedy of errors didn't end there. Ahead of a Week 7 road game, Mallet missed the team flight and the Texans severed ties and cut the gaff-prone QB on October 27.     #3 ‚Äì Antonio Brown, Oakland Raiders, September 2019 Antonio Brown with Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr in the 2019 preseason Another awkward scenario that played out on Hard Knocks was the tale of Antonio Brown's frozen feet. After signing a big-money deal to be the marquee signing in Jon Gruden's first year at the Oakland Raiders, Brown froze his toes by not wearing the correct protection in a cryotherapy chamber. While training alone during camp, Brown kicked up a fuss about the league's new helmet rules and refused to embrace enhanced safety gear. After making a public apology for the distractions he caused, Brown demanded his release two days before the Raiders' Week 1 game. He signed for the New England Patriots and was cut by them after one game, following accusations of sexual assualt.

After an underpar rookie season, Haskins was benched in Week 5 of year two for showing a lack of work ethic. He was fined $5,000 for breaking COVID-19 protocols by bringing a friend into the team bubble, and was later stripped of the captaincy and fined $40,000 for being photographed at a party without a facemask. After being benched once again for poor performance, Washington Football Team head coach Ron Rivera felt Haskins had been handed enough chances and the quarterback was cut with one game remaining in the 2020 season. Albert Breer@AlbertBreerForgot to put this in the MMQB column, but I looked up the fastest first-round QBs to be outright cut since 2000. Four were cut b/w Year 2 and 3: Josh Rosen, Paxton Lynch, Johnny Manziel and Brandon Weeden. Dwayne Haskins is the only one to be cut before the end of Year 2.10:56 AM ¬∑ Dec 28, 20201032225     #5 ‚Äì Jaylon Smith, Dallas Cowboys, October 2021 Ex-Dallas Cowboys linebacker Jaylon Smith While the previous examples in this list have a theme of questionable decision making by the player involved, there is a much different story behind the release of Pro Bowl linebacker Jaylon Smith. The sudden rise of rookie star Micah Parsons left Smith on the fringes, and despite his high-level play during his six years in the league, the Cowboys simply opted to cut Smith.     "", ""Quick Observations For Every NFL Team From Week One  With the first week of the season in the books, I thought it would make sense to give a short update on all 32 teams around the league. Now having watched every single matchup, I came away with one observation for each NFL squad. Here's what you need to know            Oakland Raiders ‚Äì This Jon Gruden thing could go pretty wrong Unlike a lot of people, I wasn‚Äôt worried too much about Gruden not being able to adjust to the modern game and adapt different offensive schemes. I like the toughness he wants to install into his players, I think he has gained insight into different coaches with TV production meetings and I believe he is the type of flashy hire the Raiders needed after announcing they would move to Las Vegas. Regardless of all those factors, I have yet to see him display touch with this generation of players and his feel for the flow of a game in real-time. His comment about ‚Äúneeding a pass rush‚Äù after their loss to the Rams was almost comical and I thought it was pretty harsh to put all the blame on Khalil Mack for saying ‚Äú he didn‚Äôt want to be on the team‚Äù, but more importantly their offense got stuck in the mud after their portion of scripted plays and when it was time to react to how the game progressed.Tampa Bay Buccaneers ‚Äì Ryan Fitzpatrick might be the streakiest passer in NFL history     This was the biggest upset of the week and I don‚Äôt think there was anybody in the media who predicted that the Bucs could stun a popular Super Bowl pick at the Dome. However, nobody expected to see more Fitzmagic in this matchup either. The Harvard graduate has been a journeyman throughout his NFL career, having played and started for seven different franchises. He came to all but one team as a backup, but somehow always ended up in the starting lineup eventually. Fitzy has had some brilliant moments, like a six-touchdown outing against the Titans in 2014 after being benched by the Texans three weeks earlier and he set the Jets‚Äô franchise record for passing touchdown in a season with 31 in 2015, but plenty of times after those heroic performances, he has stunk the following week. Last Sunday was another one of those brilliant moments, when he played an almost perfect game and might have already started a quarterback controversy in Tampa     Atlanta Falcons ‚Äì Steve Sarkisian still is a horrific play-caller I don‚Äôt enjoy bashing coaches and calling for anybody‚Äôs job, but it‚Äôs just frustrating to watch this Falcons offense have so much talent and have it go to waste. I appreciate the fact that Sarkisian made it a priority to find ways to put the ball into the hands of his best player, but he just doesn‚Äôt seem to have a clear plan on how to feature his arsenal of playmakers. First-round pick Calvin Ridley didn‚Äôt catch a single pass, despite already being an outstanding route-runner and what he showed in preseason, plus the Eagles didn‚Äôt have anybody capable of covering Freeman or Coleman having without Nigel Bradham in the lineup. More importantly though, those red-zone trips were just embarrassing. For all the times Sark has been critiqued for not targeting Julio on the red-zone, he has tried to make up for it by zeroing in on number 11 in two games versus the Eagles, despite facing double-coverage constantly. At least he put him in a stack once to give him a free release, but you have to give the guys with one-on-one opportunities a chance.      Baltimore Ravens ‚Äì That defense is nasty This franchise has always been known for tough, physical defenses and last year they already looked like one of the dominant units for most of the year, as they led the league in takeaways and pitched three different shutouts throughout the season. With that being said, they might be even more terrifying in 2018 and they started things of right with a 47-3 hammering of the Buffalo Bills. The Baltimore front controlled the line of scrimmage the entire game and completely shut down the Bills‚Äô rushing attack, forcing Nathan Peterman to beat them with his arm. After throwing two picks and putting up a QB rating of 0.0 they sent out Josh Allen in the second half, but the only real success he had came on the ground, as he outrushed LeSean McCoy with 26 yards. That performance is even more impressive considering the Ravens were without their top cornerback in Jimmy Smith. Baltimore goes five guys deep at edge rusher, C.J. Mosley is a perennial Pro Bowler and their secondary is full of ball-hawks.     Buffalo Bills ‚Äì The Nathan Peterman era is over After finally reaching the playoffs for the first time in 20 years, the Bills were due to regress after trading quarterback Tyrod Taylor and drafting developmental prospects at quarterback and linebacker. They brought in A.J. McCarron to go with seventh overall pick Josh Allen, but decided to trade him a week before the regular season as they chose Nathan Peterman as their starter under center. We all remember the mistake they made pulling Tyrod for him last year, as he threw five picks in just the first half versus the Chargers and he had an even worse performance in the season-opener. Peterman completed 5 of his 18 pass attempts for 24 yards, no touchdowns, two interceptions and a QB rating of zero, while not picking up a single first down. The offensive line has been a mess as well and the pass-catcher haven‚Äôt really helped him out either, but I think the second-year man is only out there to take the hits until Josh Allen is ready to go.      Carolina Panthers ‚Äì A running Cam Newton scares defenses Outside of his MVP season Cam Newton averages a completion percentage of 59.4, 288 passing yards per game, 20.5 touchdowns a season and a quarterback rating of 83.2. Everybody who has been reading my blog for the last five years knows I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the Panthers quarterback and for detail on why you can read more of my content or ask me directly. With that being said ‚Äì boy, is that guy scary when he takes off. At 6‚Äô6‚Äù, 250 pounds Superman is as tough to bring down as anybody in the league and the Cowboys got to know that first hand once again on Sunday. Cam ran the ball 10 times for 58 yards and a touchdown, with all but one of those rushing attempts coming off zone-read plays or designed QB runs. The yardage total should even be six yards higher considering the Panthers ended the game by taking a knee three times for minus six yards. Cam is a beast as a runner and you always have to pay attention to him.     Chicago Bears ‚Äì This team is for real I know they just gave up a 20:0 lead, but I don‚Äôt want to hear anybody say that the Bears choked or anything like that. The offense moved the ball (even if they had to settle for field goals) even for most of the second half and they made Aaron Rodgers move around on a bad knee. They just were a victim of the game‚Äôs best QB smelling blood in the water. Matt Nagy is a genius play-caller, who understands how to use the new weapons with movement and misdirection. Tarik Cohen is his version of Tyreek Hill as a gadget player and Mitch Trubisky looks very comfortable in that offense. Khalil Mack was unreal with just one week of practice and this defensive front got after it. Akiem Hicks is a disruptive force and Roquan Smith‚Äôs first play in an NFL game ended up in a sack. This is a dangerous squad.      Cincinnati Bengals ‚Äì Joe Mixon is a playmaker When I looked at last week‚Äôs matchups and I saw Mixon would go up against the Colts defense, I already had him pencilled in as my RB1 for fantasy. Last year as a rookie, the former Oklahoma back was limited to 3.5 yards a carry behind a lacklustre offensive line, but with the additions of Duane Brown via trade and Billy Price in the draft, I expect a big season for the second-year man. A top-twenty talent a year ago, Mixon now with his mind set on the field, where he has looked like a tremendous all-around back in week one versus Indianapolis. Mixon amassed 149 yards from scrimmage on just 22 touches. He displayed balance, burst and power, but more importantly outstanding vision and patience. The screen game with him looked excellent and he has that Le‚ÄôVeon Bell-esque running style. With that being said, he will face a tough test tomorrow night versus Baltimore who held Shady to 22 yards on the ground Sunday.     Cleveland Browns ‚Äì The Browns still haven‚Äôt won a game I understand this is more of a fact than an observation, but let me explain to you what I mean with this. The Browns came into this game with as good a roster as they have had in several years and they were hungry for a W after an 0-16 campaign, especially against a team that had beaten them in 14 of their last 16 meetings. Over the course of the game the Steelers turned the ball over six times and basically handed the Browns the victory. Big Ben threw three picks in the first half, but none of them ended in points for Cleveland. Up 21-7 in the middle of the fourth quarter, they capitalized off a fumble recovery at the PIT one-yard line and having the ball at midfield almost off a punt. Having driven the ball down the field close to field goal range with less than half a minute left, Tyrod tossed an ill-advised pick to send them to overtime. After a series of three-and-outs and a missed Steelers field goal, Genard Avery‚Äôs strip-sack set them up for a 45-yard game-winner themselves, but they saw it blocked by T.J. Watt. I know it officially is a tie, but this was a moral loss for Cleveland, which could have kick-started a new chapter of their franchise‚Äôs history.      Dallas Cowboys ‚Äì Nobody on the outside is ready to win in the passing game Putting the ball into the hands of Zeke just 18 times simply won‚Äôt get it done. The Cowboys need to establish the running game, even without All-Pro center Travis Frederick, to set up opportunities to win on play-action. When Dallas is forced into obvious passing situations, there simply are no receivers, who can win consistently and Dak Prescott is not the type of guy, who will throw them open against man-coverage. On the final two drives of the game the Cowboys had opportunities to move the ball down the field by pushing it outside the numbers, but they counted on Deonte Thompson to make plays. Allen Hurns, Terrance Williams and rookie Michael Gallup all only caught one pass, while Cole Beasley kind of kept them alive by catching seven short passes out of the slot and turning most of them into first downs. The Cowboys better get this ground game going or this could be a long season.     Denver Broncos ‚Äì Von Miller is a freaking beast I originally wanted to talk about how this team is ready to win right now and that Chad Kelly might be the better option under center after Case Keenum almost cost them a win with his three interceptions on Sunday, but oh my god ‚Äì can Von Miller ball. That dude completely wrecked the Seahawks gameplan by recorded three sacks, four QB hurries and forcing two fumbles. He was chasing Russell Wilson around all game long and made Germain Ifedi look like trash. Von got one strip-sack off a stunt with Wilson stepping up into the pocket and the second one he came in from behind on Chris Carson and simply took the ball out of his hands like he was a little baby. This guy is a bad man, who has been wreaking havoc on quarterbacks around the league for seven years now and he is off to a good start to finally win a Defensive Player of the Year award.      Detroit Lions ‚Äì Matthew Stafford is one tough son of a gun I could talk about the four interceptions Stafford threw and they were all pretty bad. I could also talk about a Matt Patricia‚Äôs horrific start to his head coaching career and how his defense made a rookie quarterback look like Tom Brady on Monday night. Yet, I want people to appreciate the toughness Stafford displays constantly. He got knocked around like a rag doll and you saw him limping on and off the field. I thought at some point the coaches should have just pulled him out of the game, but he went to them again and again to say he wants to go out on the field. This was not the first time the Lions QB played through injury. I remember an incredible comeback win against the Browns as a rookie in 2009, when he took a huge shot and could barely move his left arm, but pushed the doctors aside to go back out for the game-winning TD. I also remember a narrow loss to the Panthers last year, when he had his whole leg taped up and blood running down his hand. Nothing will keep this man off the field ‚Äì not even his own medical staff.     Green Bay Packers ‚Äì Aaron Rodgers is the most dangerous man in football This is nothing new to me. Aaron Rodgers has pulled off stuff like this throughout the years and you can never count him and the Packers out, but it‚Äôs been a while since I last saw him work his magic. After being carted off and seeing his team go down by three touchdowns, it was time for the King of the North to take over once again. You could clearly tell that Rodgers had trouble moving and he was playing on guts, but he just carved that Bears defense up from the pocket. That bomb to the back of the end-zone to Geronimo Allison was amazing and I know Randall Cobb gained 65 yards of that 75-yard touchdown after the catch, but even that ability to understand how he will adjust his route where the ball has to be put was surgical. When you don‚Äôt put this man away, there is always a chance he will do unbelievable things.      Houston Texans ‚Äì Deshaun Watson is not totally back yet Deshaun Watson was so incredibly impressive in his injury-shortened rookie campaign that it was almost unfair to expect him to continue that trend in 2018. Going toe-for-toe with Tom Brady and Russell Wilson in shootouts on his way to scoring 20 touchdowns in six starts put him in the national spotlight before tearing his ACL in practice. In his much-anticipated return as a second-year player he didn‚Äôt look the same. Watson put his eyes down on the rush way too often instead of keeping them downfield to make plays. He showed a lack of decisiveness and accuracy down the field. Not only did he complete only 50 percent of his passes, he also threw a pretty bad pick when he was late and short on a deep ball to the end-zone. With that being said, he didn‚Äôt seem to have trouble moving around and he had his team in position to make a late comeback. So let‚Äôs see how quickly he can get back to himself mentally.     Indianapolis Colts ‚Äì Andrew Luck is finally back It was more than 600 days until we last saw Andrew Luck throw a pass in a regular NFL game and he did not disappoint in his comeback. The Colts‚Äô star quarterback didn‚Äôt look good at all in preseason, being late on some throws and simply being hesitant to pull the trigger when he needed to. On Sunday it was time for live competition and Luck was ready to go. He showed mobility, touch and arm strength to rifle in some passes over the middle. He scanned the entire field, showing that he can still process information and understand where to go with the ball. The 29-year old took a vicious cheap-shot to the head by a Bengals safety, but got right back up and went back to work. Luck converted 11 of 15 third downs, including a sack. He gave the Colts the element of the downfield passing back and would have had his team in position for one of his notorious game-winning drives, did Jack Doyle not fumble after a 3-and-15 conversion. Luck made some ill-advised decisions and still needs to get used to the speed of the game, but he looks like Andrew Luck again.      Jacksonville Jaguars ‚Äì They absolutely need to win with their run game and defense The good thing is that the Jags already did that last year, when they led the league in rushing and finished the season 2nd in both yards and points allowed defensively. With the addition of Andrew Norwell to their offensive line and some of the young players on defense gaining more experience, both areas could be even better and they need to be when you look at what they have in the passing game. I like their second-year receivers Dede Westbrook and Keelan Cole, plus I think Austin-Seferian Jenkins can be a mismatch as that flex tight-end, but how can you trust Blake Bortles? He completed 54.5 percent of his passes for 176 yards even though the Giants put everybody they could into the box. His best work came on scrambles. I won‚Äôt put that interception completely on him, because Donte Moncrief turned his head around way too early, allowing Janoris Jenkins to do so as well, but Bortles is not the guy you want to count on to win you games and Leonard Fournette get healthy soon.     Arizona Cardinals ‚Äì Sam Bradford is the check down king It‚Äôs nothing new that Sam Bradford likes to check the ball down underneath and even his then record-setting completion percentage of 71.6 back in 2016 felt like a product of throwing it short of the sticks on third downs constantly. Yet, this Sunday he took it to a different level. Bradford threw 13 underneath passes to his running backs with little room to run, leading to 9 of his 20 completions. I like to see quarterbacks throw it out hot to defeat blitzes and if nothing is there I‚Äôd rather see them check the ball down, but you need to stretch defences vertically and attack the entire field. I know it‚Äôs early and Bradford will have another couple of weeks to prove he can get it done, but eventually it‚Äôs time to put Josh Rosen out there because he (at times to a fault) isn‚Äôt afraid to push the ball down the field.      Kansas City Chiefs ‚Äì Tyreek Hill is by far the biggest homerun hitter in the NFL I almost feel bad for not talking about Patrick Mahomes, because he was amazing. Those sidearm throws, bombs down the field and overall control of the offence makes me question my playoff predictions already. Yet, I want to talk about a different young player, because Tyreek is just a freak. Ever since Hill came into the league in 2016 you knew he was a touchdown waiting to happen. He scored three 80+ yard return touchdowns to go with his nine scores on offence as a rookie. Last Sunday versus the Chiefs he once again proved he is the most electric big-play threat in the game. Hill started the day off with a 91-yard punt return touchdown, but ended the game with 171 yards and two touchdowns on offence as well, including another 58-yard catch-and-run play. You just can‚Äôt blink when you face this guy, because if you do he might already be gone.     Los Angeles Rams ‚Äì You can‚Äôt fall in love with the pass game This is such a talented team. The Rams are loaded at pretty much every single position outside of linebacker. They made some enormous additions on the defensive side of the ball and the offense might be most fun to watch with playmakers all over the yard and Sean McVay‚Äôs creative play-designs. And while I thought their slow start versus the Raiders was more about the lack of live reps than anything else, as they sat most of their starters throughout the preseason, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice one element of their game in particular ‚Äì they got pass-happy. The Rams started the game with a three-and-out before going down the field in consecutive pass plays and then putting the ball into the hands of Todd Gurley on a little touch-pass sweep for a 19-yard score. The following drive they threw it five times while Gurley only touched the ball twice to end the half with just eight-and-a-half minute of possession. Over the final 30 games they handed the ball off to Gurley 17 times, but at the start of the fourth quarter up 23-13 they went back to throwing the ball on eight of their nine plays. Todd Gurley is the engine that makes this offense go and they need to establish him to open up everything else.      Miami Dolphins ‚Äì Adam Gase can elevate an offense with average talent The Dolphins head coach got rid of guys like Jay Ajayi, Jarvis Landry, Mike Pouncey and Ndamokung Suh, who were all very good players but apparently didn‚Äôt fit in with the disciplined Gase. Instead he brought in locker-room guys like Danny Amendola, Frank Gore and Daniel Kilgore, who can help turn around the culture of his franchise. However, that lack of offensive firepower comes at a price when it comes to the talent-level. I think Kenyan Drake is a superstar in the making, but DeVante Parker has yet to show any consistency and Kenny Stills has been a very good number three receiver, who shouldn‚Äôt lead your team in yards. Outside of a badly placed ball on a fade route to rookie Mike Gesicki split out wide and an overthrown deep shot leading to interceptions I thought this offense moved the ball pretty well. They won with clever route-combinations and different alignments.     Minnesota Vikings ‚Äì This is a complete team When you think about the Vikings you think of defense first and deservedly so. That unit held Jimmy Garoppolo to 15 of 33 with one touchdown compared to three interceptions, having taken one of them to the house. More importantly they showed they can follow the gameplan, by keeping the defensive ends home against bootlegs and taking away easy completions. However, they got the job done offensively as well. The 84-million dollar man Kirk Cousins looked confident and has already established good connections with Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen, plus he has shown understanding of play design. Case Keenum had a magical year in 2018, but Cousins is a much better player. Also, Dalvin Cook is a special talent and even though he was limited to 2.5 yards per carry, he made things happen in the quick passing game with six catches for 55 yards.  New England Patriots ‚Äì Gronk is pretty much unstoppable one-on-one     We heard all about the lack of pass-catchers surrounding Brady as we have done in recent years with Brandin Cooks, Danny Amendola and Dion Lewis all gone, but as long as they have Rob Gronkowski they have that one guy who simply can‚Äôt be covered by one man. Throughout the all-world tight-end‚Äôs career there have been very few guys, who have been able to at least slow him and it has really only been those big hits from Bernard Pollard and Earl Thomas that made him less of a locomotive in the middle of the field. Last Sunday the Texans were tasked to come up with a strategy to make Brady‚Äôs number one weapon less effective and they just couldn‚Äôt find a way. They played straight-up, put safeties on him, moved linebacker Zach Cunningham to the outside and shaded him with a safety over the top, but nothing worked. Gronk still ended up with seven catches for 123 yards.     Los Angeles Chargers ‚Äì These guys just can‚Äôt start fast I might have made a mistake. I predicted the Chargers would win 12 games and earn the AFC‚Äôs number one seed. What I forgot or rather what I blindly trusted would change was the fact this team simply can‚Äôt beat the Chiefs (now having lost the last nine meetings) and they don‚Äôt get out of the gates running. Yes, they were without Joey Bosa and yes, Antonio Gates still needs to find his way back, but this team made mistakes in all facets of the game. Philip Rivers threw a crucial pick in field-goal range in the third quarter, they didn‚Äôt run the ball often enough, the defense gave up seven plays of 20+ yards, they allowed a punt return touchdown over the entire field to Tyreek Hill and they still can‚Äôt convert field goals when they really matter, as Caleb Sturgis missed a 48-yarder when the Chargers still had more than a minute and all three timeouts left. I still believe in this team because they are so damn talented, but they better get started because Kansas City looks explosive.      New York Jets ‚Äì Sam Darnold is the Jets‚Äô saviour I had four blue-chip players at the top of my draft board, who I thought were can‚Äôt-miss guys, but right behind them I had Darnold, who also was my clear-cut number one QB and I feel pretty good about that right now. The rookie out of USC already looked very impressive when I watched his preseason tape, with how quickly he diagnosed coverages and processed information. He just doesn‚Äôt seem to get fooled by disguises and doesn‚Äôt show any hesitation when defenses change post-snap, but instead he just simply knows how to adjust and where to go with the ball. Outside of the anticipatory skills and his toughness, it was his even keel attitude that made me believe in him as a pro. That‚Äôs why I thought tossing that pick-six when trying to squeeze in a wheel route to the running back across the field was a perfect start to his career in the sense that you can see how he will respond. He went on to complete 16 of his 20 passes, while going four for four on third downs for 72 yards plus another conversion with his feet. The defense was unbelievable, but finally having that franchise quarterback is the key for Gang Green.      Philadelphia Eagles ‚Äì This team can win ugly games Carson Wentz will likely be out for another couple of weeks and no matter what anybody says, Nick Foles is not nearly as good. People forget that the Eagles defense gave up 20 points per game and they averaged just over 100 yards rushing until their bye in week nine last season. A lot of weight was on the shoulders of their young signal-caller, who I had as my MVP favorite until he got hurt versus the Rams. He was tremendous at producing big plays and keeping drives alive on third downs. The defense was pretty dominant throughout the playoffs at home and Nick Foles played the best football of his career, but they couldn‚Äôt do anything to stop Tom Brady until Brandon Graham‚Äôs strip-sack and I analyzed the brilliant offensive play-calling that made Foles‚Äô job a lot easier. However, in an opening game where the offense looked sloppy their ferocious D-line took over and they emerged victorious, buying Wentz some time to fully recover.      Pittsburgh Steelers ‚Äì The Le‚ÄôVeon Bell drama is in full swing I could talk about Big Ben‚Äôs ridiculous struggles on the road or T.J. Watt‚Äôs monster game of four sacks and the blocked field goal at the end of the game, but we all know what is on every Steelers‚Äô fans mind right now ‚Äì is Le‚ÄôVeon Bell worth the distractions? This is not Bell‚Äôs fault primarily since Pittsburgh has been the most-drama filled franchise in the NFL for a couple of years now. All the on-field antics, contract disputes and media news have felt like a reality show more so than a professional football team at times. Bell‚Äôs contract status has been discussed all offseason and he has yet to show at the team‚Äôs facility or sign his franchise tender. To me, he is the best all-around back in football, but the Steelers clearly don‚Äôt see him as part of their future at his price tag. James Conner‚Äôs outstanding performance of 192 scrimmage yards and two TDs certainly won‚Äôt quiet down the noise and at this point, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see Bell traded.     San Francisco 49ers ‚Äì Jimmy G is not invincible Everybody knew that Jimmy Garoppolo couldn‚Äôt stay undefeated forever, but with this statement I refer more to the fact that a good gameplan and the players to execute it can give the young signal-caller trouble. His completion-percentage of 45 percent and the fact he went three for eight on third downs are especially underwhelming when you consider some of the genius offensive scheming by Kyle Shanahan. Garoppolo‚Äôs job was made much easier being given easy dumpoffs off bootlegs, clever play-designs that included fake pick-plays and wide open crossing routes off misdirection. Of his three interceptions he overthrew one of his receivers, who fell down on a curl route, put a slant above the pads and he basically ended the game by trying to force the ball down the seam against triple-coverage. I still like him a lot going forward, which I described in my analysis of him once he signed his big contract, but this was a wakeup call.      Seattle Seahawks ‚Äì Germain Ifedi can not hang in there Von Miller had himself a day versus those Seahawks. He recorded three sacks, four hurries and two forced fumbles. The Broncos knew what they were doing however, because most of those numbers came rushing off the left end versus Germain Ifedi. Von had single-digit rushes against Duane Brown, who was holding his own, but he just killed the Hawks right tackle. One sack came off a stunt with the tight-end chipping him and his second fumble happened a couple of yards downfield when Miller simply took it away from Chris Carson. But Back to Ifedi ‚Äì I know it‚Äôs a very tough assignment because Von still is the premiere edge rusher in the NFL, but that was an embarrassing showing and it‚Äôs not like Sunday was the first time we‚Äôve seen that from Ifedi. He has been one of the worst starting offensive linemen in the league since he was drafted in 2015. He constantly overextended and leaned outside his frame, putting himself into horrible positions on Sunday.      Tennessee Titans ‚Äì This team could be in a lot of injury trouble There were a few things I came away with after the Titans week one game, like Marcus Mariota still staring down some of his receivers and not getting off his primary read or the defense being tricked easily on some plays, but with the bad luck they have had in terms of injuries, this was my main observation. In almost seven hours from the kickoff the Titans saw Marcus Mariota leave the game with a banged up elbow, Taylor Lewan entering concussion protocol after taking a cheap-shot and Delanie Walker being carted off the field with a dislocated ankle. Add to that the fact that Taylor Lewan is still recovering from a torn ACL and an offense that I thought could really shine under the lead of new offensive coordinator Matt LaFleur might be very limited at least for a certain period of time. Let‚Äôs hope they are healthy soon again.      Washington Redskins ‚Äì The O-line is nasty and AP could have another huge year I surprised some people when I said the Redskins had one of the top ten combinations of offensive and defensive line back in June. They were constantly reshuffling along both fronts last season, especially on the offensive side of the ball. However, when they are at 100 percent they are punishing people. I think Trent Williams is the best left tackle in football, Brandon Scherff is a Pro Bowl guard, Chase Roullier‚Äôs mobility at center gives them another dimension and they just work extremely well together. In the process, I think Adrian Peterson could have a major resurgence, because he will have running room and he moved like a 25-year old out there. Up 21-nothing at halftime, Washington pounded the ball on 42 rush attempts for 182 yards. Plus they ran a screen pass to AP that went for 52 yards and would have closed the game if there was no fumble.

54,Baker Mayfield,"['Report reveals Browns player was unhappy with Baker Mayfield\'s poor performance in training  Baker Mayfield is currently facing a battle for his NFL future, which lies in limbo. He remains on the Cleveland Browns\' roster despite the franchise making it abundantly clear they will be moving forward with Deshaun Watson as their starting quarterback.  A recent report has questioned Mayfield\'s ability and that he was regularly poor in practice, according to an unnamed Browns player. The information contained a quote from a Browns player. The statement addresses a video Odell Beckham Jr.\'s father released on social media in November last year, showing the quarterback not throwing the ball to his son, who was open on several occasions.                View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post           According to the report, when asked if he had seen the video posted by Beckham Jr.\'s father, the unnamed Browns player gave a scathing response. He said: ""Why would I watch the video? I see it every day in practice."" Offseason Chopz@Pchopz_Oh boy.3417478     This is another negative view that could hinder Mayfield\'s search for a new team. With the NFL Draft ending, the chance for the Browns to move him on to pastures new and focus on the future with a different quarterback have also diminished. The Carolina Panthers were interested in Mayfield, but recent reports have shown that they were never close to a deal with the Browns. The Panthers went on to draft Matt Corral, who will challenge Sam Darnold for the starting job in Charlotte.        Other potential teams that needed a quarterback have made moves to find the piece to the puzzle, with the Pittsburgh Steelers drafting Kenny Pickett and the Seattle Seahawks set to move forward with Drew Lock behind center. Seattle head coach Pete Carroll recently stated that the Seahawks weren\'t looking to add another quarterback \'at all\' to their roster, which puts an end to Seattle being a possible destination for Mayfield.  Why are teams reluctant to make a trade for Baker Mayfield? One of the main hurdles is the quarterback\'s $19 million salary due in 2022. Teams seem reluctant to take on that amount, which reportedly led to the Panthers\' and Browns\' inability to agree on trade terms.   It also seems highly unlikely that Mayfield will stay and offer back-up for Watson as he sees himself as the starting quarterback. Based on the NFL Index quarterback rankings, he ranked 25th out of 62 quarterbacks, with his inconsistency proving to be a significant shortcoming.     ', ""NFL Fantasy: LA Rams' QB update: Is Baker Mayfield starting tonight vs. Broncos?  Baker Mayfield looks like he is enjoying playing football for the first time in a mighty long time. The Los Angeles Rams quarterback has had a bright start to his time with the reigning Super Bowl champions, injecting some fire into an increasingly stagnant offense.  Astonishingly, this is the former number-one draft pick's third team of the 2022 season, but that's the NFL for you. Mayfield will be looking to close out the season with a flourish, as he will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the campaign.        Baker Mayfield will start tonight against the Denver Broncos in a battle featuring two of the biggest disappointments of the season. On one side are the defending Super Bowl champions, the Los Angeles Rams, who have already been eliminated from playoff contention following a Week 15 loss. Then there's the Denver Broncos, where Russell Wilson has been cooking but is yet to serve up a feast.           Mayfield is likely to start the remaining games of the season for the Rams as he seeks to rebuild his reputation before his contract expires.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Baker Mayfield fantasy outlook Baker Mayfield's 2022 season has been one of the most colorful in recent league history. He started the year as the wantaway backup following Deshaun Watson's arrival at the Cleveland Browns. Mayfield expressed his displeasure and was eventually traded to the Carolina Panthers for a low draft pick. That gave Mayfield a new lease of life, as he would be the Panthers' undisputed starting QB. However, his performances were disappointing, and he was benched after a mere seven games. After being benched for a second time, Baker Mayfield requested his release, which the Panthers granted. The LA Rams promptly picked him up and here we are. In his second game as a Ram, Mayfield failed to put up a similar performance to his debut game against the Las Vegas Raiders. He could not get much of anything going and experienced five sacks. Mayfield will face a dicey test against a resilient Denver defense, who have been the only positive in the Broncos' season.     Mayfield is not expected to shine in what is likely to be a low-scoring affair. He will probably get a passing touchdown (hopefully two) and around 200 yards through the air. This isn't exactly dynamite in fantasy terms, so start him at your own risk. There's always the chance of a Christmas miracle, but it is not being anticipated by many around the league. Mayfield's 12.17 projection (PPR Leagues) tells the whole story.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post How is Baker Mayfield performing this season?

"", 'Patrick Mahomes vs. Oklahoma: Revisiting 2x NFL MVP‚Äôs iconic performance for Texas Tech  Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is arguably the best quarterback in the NFL today.  The two-time Super Bowl champion led the Chiefs to their second Super Bowl victory in the last five years against the Philadelphia Eagles as they won 38-35.        Prior to his NFL career, Mahomes shone at Texas Tech University. The Chiefs were so impressed by Mahomes in college that they traded up for him in the 2017 NFL Draft.           In three seasons at Texas Tech, Mahomes threw for 11,252 yards, 93 touchdowns, and 29 interceptions. The most memorable game of Mahomes\' college career was against Baker Mayfield\'s Oklahoma Sooners on October 22, 2016. The two quarterbacks shone in a game that made NCAA history. The two combined for 12 touchdown passes and 1,279 passing yards. Mahomes accounted for 734 passing yards and five touchdowns. He also led Texas Tech in rushing yards with 85 and two rushing touchdowns.        Mahomes completed 52 out of 88 passing attempts, while Mayfield completed 27 out of 36 passes. The Sooners won by a score of 66-59 in an epic showdown in Luboock, Texas. Both quarterbacks ended up becoming first-round picks in the NFL. They met during the AFC divisional playoffs in 2021 as the Chiefs defeated Cleveland by a score of 22-17. Ahead of the divisional showdown, Mahomes recalled the legendary college game and was excited to play against Mayfield in the divisional playoffs. Mahomes said via ESPN: ""It\'s cool to get to play against him in such a big game, in the playoffs. Known him for a long time, since I was a senior in high school and to be able to play on this stage is going to be special.""

', 'Analyst thinks Panthers are a playoff team with Baker Mayfield  Baker Mayfield\'s time with the Cleveland Browns has come to an end following his trade to the Carolina Panthers. Panthers fans are excited to see what the new season and their new quarterback will bring. The trade appears to have got some analysts a little giddy too.  One has gone as far as to suggest that Mayfield\'s arrival has turned Carolina into a playoff contender. Former NFL quarterback and ESPN analyst Dan Orlovsky was speaking on First Take and had the following to share:        ""This is why I think this is a playoff team with Baker Mayfield the guy we saw two years ago, cause that\'s the last time he was healthy, he was third in the NFL in QBR, and led them to the playoffs.""           Orlovsky continued: ""Number one, this is a top ten defense in the NFL with the Carolina Panthers, has one of the better young defensive lines in the league with Brian Burns and Derrick Brown. They also get Jaycee Horn back who was their superstar corner, first-round draft pick from the South Carolina, they\'ll get him back healthy. So this is going to be a very good defense."" The former Detroit Lions quarterback then discussed the Panthers offensive line:     ""Number two, you talked about the improvement of the offensive line. But you talk about drafting a tackle, top-six overall isn\'t a big deal if he\'s a really good player, it\'s 20% of the offensive line. If Ickey Ekwonu is what many offensive line people say he is going to be, that\'s a huge jump in their performance."" Before finally addressing Carolina\'s receivers: ""This is the best wide receiver group that Baker Mayfield has ever played with, and you can\'t debate that. Robby Anderson, DJ Moore and Rashard Higgins, that\'s the best wide receiver group he has ever had.""         Baker Mayfield\'s 2020 performance with the Cleveland Browns Oklahoma Spring Game Whenever fans of Baker Mayfield want to talk up his credentials, they immediately point to the 2020 season. During which he led the Browns to a 11-5 record, taking them to the postseason for the first time since 2002. He delivered their first playoff victory of the millennium against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Baker Mayfield had a passer rating of 95.9 with 3,563 passing yards, 26 touchdowns and eight interceptions that season. His completion percentage was still below 63%, despite throwing less than he had even done before, as the Browns became a run-heavy offense.     Cleveland Browns@Browns.@bakermayfield\'s top plays from the 2020 season 77921276 Baker protected the ball better in 2020. His interception rate dropped dramatically, as did his number of sacks.

Statistics don\'t tell the whole story and can be quite misleading at times. But what is glaringly obvious when comparing 2020 to his career numbers is that Baker Mayfield is inaccurate when under duress.     If you give him time to pass within a simplified system, with an excellent run game, then he can be effective when he plays within his limitations. It will be interesting to see how he gets on with Carolina.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit First Take and H/T Sportskeeda     ', ""Why Did Baker Mayfield Leave Cleveland?  Baker Mayfield entered the NFL as one of the most promising quarterbacks. The Cleveland Browns drafted him as the first overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft. He had an outstanding first three seasons with the team, and it seemed he would remain in Cleveland for a longer time.  He won six games each in his first two years, but ended up with two consecutive losing seasons. In 2020, things changed for Mayfield, when he started in all 16 games and ended the season with a 11-5 record. That year, he threw for 3,563 yards with 26 passing touchdowns, eight interceptions, and a pass completion percentage of 62.8.                     He helped the Browns reach the divisional round by beating the Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs. The Browns suffered a 17-22 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round, but overall the team gained respect for their outstanding performance that season. During the 2021 offseason, everyone was expecting a contract extension for Baker Mayfield. But after a terrible 2021 season, he ended up being traded to the Carolina Panthers.  Why did the Cleveland Browns trade Baker Mayfield to the Panthers?     Carolina Panthers v Baltimore Ravens In 2021, the Browns entered the league as one of the top contenders in the NFL, with Baker Mayfield as their starting quarterback. They wanted to capture the top position in the AFC North, but ended up being third in their division. The team started the season with a 29-33 loss to the Chiefs. It was a close game, and the expectations followed the Browns into their week 2 game. In Week 2, Mayfield sustained a torn labrum in his left shoulder while attempting a tackle on an interception. He kept playing with an injured shoulder until it worsened during the Week 6 game against the Arizona Cardinals and missed the next game against the Broncos, returning to the field in week 8.     In Week 10, he had a knee injury, but that did not keep him away from playing in the next game against the Lions. He missed only two more games, one in week 15 because of the Covid-19 protocol and in the final game of the season against the Bengals as he underwent shoulder surgery. Baker Mayfield was held responsible for Odell Beckham's Jr.'s poor performance in the 2021 season Buffalo Bills v Cleveland Browns     November 2 was the trade deadline for the 2021 season, and on the same day Beckham's father posted a video on Instagram showing the QB missing his son on passes and blaming Mayfield for the OBJ's down year. Tensions grew in the locker room and three days later, Beckham was traded to the Los Angeles Rams.    Beckham's performance in the second half of the season was outstanding as he helped the Rams lift the Lombardi trophy. This raised some questions about Mayfield's ability as a good quarterback.     As the season was about to end, there were reports of tensions between Brown's head coach Kevin Stefanski and Baker Mayfield, who was also frustrated over the lack of extension talks from the team despite the team picking up his fifth-year option for the 2022 season. The Browns traded star QB Deshaun Watson from the Houston Texans after a grand jury cleared him of his acquisitions. They made it clear that Watson will be their new starting quarterback.

The decision came after the Panthers' poor performance in the league. The Panthers also fired their head coach, Matt Rhule, for the same reason.   The Los Angeles Rams claimed Mayfield after his release from the Panthers. He played for them this week and led them to a comeback win against the Las Vegas Raiders.     "", ""What happened to Baker Mayfield? Is he playing?  The Carolina Panthers played the Baltimore Ravens in a Week 11 matchup, and prized offseason acquisition Baker Mayfield started for them. He recently suffered an ankle injury, but that's not the sole reason he didn't play.  He was healthy enough to avoid going on injured reserve, but in his brief health-related absence, he lost the starting job to backup PJ Walker.                     While Mayfield and Sam Darnold both recovered from ankle injuries, Walker came in and breathed new life into the offense. They beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and nearly beat the Falcons, thanks to Walker's miraculous touchdown pass. PJ Walker warms up for the Carolina Panthers' game against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 10.     Regardless, Walker's future remains uncertain as Baker Mayfield returned for the Cleveland Browns' Week 11 Sunday clash against the Baltimore Ravens.  When will Baker Mayfield play again? Mayfield played on Sunday vs. the Ravens. He completed 18 of 28 passes for 140 yards and one interception. His pedestrian stats reflected the 13-3 loss that Carolina suffered at the hands of Lamar Jackson and the Ravens. Jackson's mediocre performance was enough to get past the Panthers. In a game that was dominated by defense, the Ravens quarterback put up 209 yards passing and one pick. He further completed 24 of his 33 throws.

"", 'Panthers GM takes shots at Baker Mayfield following Bucs QB‚Äôs failure last season  The Carolina Panthers drafted Bryce Young with the No.1 overall pick in the NFL Draft. That decision was made based on what fellow quarterbacks Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnold were offering.  Despite the pair playing well in patches, the Panthers knew, deep down, that neither was worthy of a long-term deal that would have seen their salary skyrocket.        Panthers general manager Scott Fitterer said as much as he detailed the main reason why the organization drafted Young and decided to move on from Mayfield and Darnold.

Baker Mayfield played six games for the Panthers last season and went 1-5 in those games. He threw for only six touchdowns and six interceptions and had a completion percentage of just 57.8.        It was this kind of form that led the Panthers front office to trade up and get the No.1 overall pick and take Bryce Young. Now that they are headed in a new direction, an air of optimism surrounds the organization regarding what Young can bring.Mayfield was a stop gap, and as Fitterer alluded to, if you are going to be paying a quarterback top money, then he will need to be worthy of it, and clearly, they thought neither Mayfield nor Darnold were.     ', '3 games by Baker Mayfield that prove he is not a bust  There is so much discussion at the moment among NFL fans about the true nature of Baker Mayfield and his career. Is he a bust for the Cleveland Browns? Or is the team just deciding he is no longer a good fit?  Calling a player a bust is a strong claim and means they have failed to live up to expectations. It also means they are soon to run out of opportunities. But let\'s take a look at the evidence here.                     Is it fair to call him a bust? At this point, that seems a bit extreme due to his past performances. Here are three games that prove Baker Mayfield is not a bust: Divisional Round - Cleveland Browns v Kansas City Chiefs     #1 - 2020 Wild Card Round This game is the shining achievement of Mayfield\'s young career and should be enough to prove that he is not a total bust. He marched into Pittsburgh during a COVID-impacted postseason and lit up the Steelers defense. He finished with three touchdowns and zero interceptions as the Browns took home a 48-37 victory to score their first postseason win since 1994. Mayfield then followed it up by nearly taking down the Kansas City Chiefs on the road a week later in the Divisional Round. The game finished 22-17 in the Chiefs\' favor. Ending a long playoff drought and being an asset in the game is not something that earns someone ""bust"" status. Cleveland Browns v Los Angeles Chargers     #2 - 2021 Week 5 Fans may be shocked to think that Mayfield had any success in 2021. But that was indeed the case, even with a torn labrum. Week 5 against the Los Angeles Chargers was arguably the most exciting game of the Browns season, as it was a total shootout.    The Chargers came out on top in the matchup with a 47-42 final score. However, Mayfield kept pace with Justin Herbert all game to the tune of 305 yards and two touchdowns. This was merely a game where time ran out during a back-and-forth affair.     Cleveland Browns v Tennessee Titans #3 - 2020 Week 13 The Browns were rolling in 2020 and that is why Mayfield was considered the future of the franchise. Week 13 saw the Browns take a 38-7 lead into halftime against the Tennessee Titans. The final was 41-35 in favor of Cleveland as the Titans launched a comeback. But that was not on the offense. The former No. 1 overall pick came out firing and had 334 yards and four touchdowns. It was one of the best games of his career and came on the road against a top AFC contender.     Such a performance proves why calling him a bust is a huge stretch. He has had more than just flashes of success in the past and his 2021 injury is clearly what held him back so much last season. A failed NFL quarterback could not light up a defense for four touchdowns in the first half without making any mistakes.Where the quarterback will play this season is still unclear, but wherever it will be he will cetainly be aiming to silence his critics.     ', ""Why is Baker Mayfield playing for the LA Rams?  The Los Angeles Rams have acquired quarterback Baker Mayfield after claiming him via waivers on Tuesday. The Carolina Panthers released the former first-round NFL draft selection on Monday.  The Rams were left with only John Wolford at quarterback. This was due to Matthew Stafford being placed on IR and Bryce Perkins suffering a neck injury.        For the Panthers, Baker Mayfield got the start in six matchups. With just 58% of his throws completed, he also threw six TD passes and six interceptions. He had a poor 1-5 record as the starting QB during his brief stay in Carolina.

Carolina consented and here we are with Baker Mayfield in LA. Head Coach Sean McVay informed the media that the team's remaining four games of the season will likely feature the new quarterback as the starter.     Despite joining the franchise only 48 hours before the game, Mayfield ended the night tossing 22-35 for 230 yards, zero interceptions, and one TD on Thursday. He instantly demonstrated to the NFL community why he was selected first overall in 2018 and a Heisman Trophy winner. NFL@NFLDown six with 1:41 to go backed up your own two-yard line? @bakermayfield was feeling dangerous. 118791707 Before Mayfield was given a chance to assist his team's offensive unit in getting back into the contest, the Rams were down by 13 points at a point. It is only fitting to assume that Mayfield has surpassed John Wolford in the Rams' quarterback depth chart due to that performance.     Mayfield's two days with a new franchise before playing as a QB was the shortest time before playing for a new team since at least 1995. Baker Mayfield is in the record books after playing for the Rams The Carolina Panthers had Baker Mayfield on their roster for less than six months. The Cleveland Browns acquired quarterback Deshaun Watson from the Houston Texans, making Mayfield desperate to leave. He joined Carolina in July, and as such, Mayfield is only the second player selected first-overall (in the history of the common draft) to have appeared for three organizations in his first five years.

55,Mitchell Trubisky,"[""Kenny Pickett's performance proves Steelers have a potential answer but not solution for Ben Roethlisberger's replacement  Kenny Pickett was selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was the organization's choice to take over as their future franchise quarterback following the retirement of Ben Roethlisberger during the 2022 NFL offseason. Roethlisberger retired after spending his entire 18 year career with the Steelers.  While Pickett would be tasked with filling big shoes, he didn't open the season as the starting quarterback. Instead, the Steelers named Mitchell Trubisky the Week 1 starter after signing him during the 2022 free agency period.        Trubisky struggled in his short time as the starting quarterback for the Steelers, losing two of his first three games. He entered a favorable match-up at home in Week 4 against the New York Jets, but failed to impress. By the end of the first half, the Steelers were trailing by a 10-6 score. This triggered head coach Mike Tomlin to make a change, bringing in rookie Kenny Pickett to replace Trubisky.           Pickett's NFL career got off to the roughest of starts as he threw an interception on his very first passing attempt ever. He would go on to complete ten of his 13 passing attempts for 120 yards, but all three of his incompletions were intercepted by the Jets defense. On a more positive note, Pickett recorded two rushing touchdowns. Dov Kleiman@NFL_DovKleimanThat was quick... Kenny Pickett throws an INT on his first drive in the NFL Was his first pass in the NFL.38362     It was a mixed performance for Pickett, who failed to complete the comeback against the Jets. Instead, the Steelers lost their third consecutive game. While it was only one half, Pickett will need to play much better moving forward. Especially if he's going to follow in Ben Roethlisberger's footsteps, which include two Super Bowl rings.     It's unclear at this point if Kenny Pickett will be named the starting quarterback moving forward or if the Steelers will give Trubisky another shot first, but an announcement by Mike Tomlin can be expected sometime prior to the Week 5 game. It will be a tough task for whoever gets named the starter, facing off against the Buffalo Bills, one of the best teams in the NFL with the top-ranked defense from a season ago.     Which teams passed on Kenny Pickett? Pittsburgh QB Kenny Pickett Pickett was the only quarterback selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft, going to the Steelers with the 20th overall pick. Several teams ahead of the Steelers in the draft order were rumored to be interested in drafting a quarterback in the first round, but ultimately decided to pass on Pickett.         The Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, and Seattle Seahawks all decided to pass on quarterbacks, filling other roster needs instead. Other teams that passed on Pickett in the first round drafted quarterbacks later. These were the Atlanta Falcons (Desmond Ridder), the Carolina Panthers (Matt Corral), and the Washington Commanders (Sam Howell). The Tennessee Titans also decided to take a quarterback later in the draft when Malik Willis fell to them in the third round. They weren't necessarily in the market for one, so didn't really pass on Pickett, but capitalized on drafting Willis for value where they got him. The New England Patriots similarly drafted Bailey Zappe in the fourth round, before a trio of speculative quarterbacks were selected late in the seventh round. Does Kenny Pickett really have small hands? Kenny Pickett at the 2022 NFL Combine     Kenny Pickett's hands measured in at just 8.5 inches during the 2022 NFL Combine. He officially has the smallest hands of any quarterback currently playing in the NFL, making his grip on the football a potential issue moving forward. While his hands are extremely small compared to other NFL quarterbacks, it's debatable how much of an impact that really has on a player's abilities. It's certain that the Steelers would have drafted him if they had any concerns about this. They scouted him thoroughly and would have watched endless tape of his college days before reaching a decision.It was great to see the rookie get on the field, although his debut didn't quite go to plan. We will see him develop and perhaps start some games in the near future.     "", ""NFL Rumor: Mitchell Trubisky will not return to the Bears in 2021  Chicago Bears' QB Mitchell Trubisky has had his ups and downs since being drafted by the team in 2017. But now it seems like the Bears will not look towards resigning Trubisky, unless they make a significant push into the playoffs.  In the 2020 off-season, the Bears had declined the fifth-year option on Trubisky's rookie contract. In retrospect, this move typically occurs when a team chooses not to give them an extension.        On the other hand, however, it could also mean that the Bears would like to give him a contract that wouldn't give Trubisky as much money as his fifth-year option did.           Kids are leaving the game today as die-hard Mitch Trubisky fans pic.twitter.com/E5OlUbg1il‚Äî PFF (@PFF) January 10, 2021 Had the Bears taken the option, Trubisky would have made around $24.8 million in 2021. Considering the way he has been playing and was benched in Week 3 for Nick Foles, the option certainly wouldn't have been worth it. Foles got the starting job in Week 4 and went 2-5 as the starter. Eventually, Trubisky was brought back in and was surprisingly able to lead the Bears on a three-game win streak, eventually giving them a playoff spot.     Also check out: Complete 2018 NFL Draft Results  Is Trubisky the future for the Bears or another team? There's no question why the Bears' organization declined the fifth-year option for Trubisky, as he simply has not been accurate in terms of performance. Trubisky's best year came in 2018, which was statistically the best season of his career under then new head coach Matt Nagy. Since then, Trubisky has been on the downfall, with both his completion percentage and touchdown/interception ratio. His 2020 regular season campaign looked very similar to his rookie season and this could be due to Nagy's play calling.

But if they do decide not to resign him, Foles certainly won't cut it for the Bears. As it is, Bears' fans are tired of seeing Trubisky play and want a veteran QB that isn't Foles to be brought to Chicago.Also check out: Complete 2019 NFL Draft Results     "", 'Predicting each NFC North team\'s record for the 2019 NFL season  With Training Camp nearly upon us, it\'s time for me to make my final record predictions for the only remaining division, the NFC North. But before I jump into record predictions, let\'s assess what each team can bring to their respective tables, going into the 2019 season.  The Packers certainly surprised many by making a splash in free agency, adding players like pass rushers Za\'Darius Smith and Preston Smith, along with safety Adrian Amos. The Vikings still have one of the league\'s most stout defenses, especially after being able to convince star linebacker Anthony Barr to return, just after he had committed to the Jets.        Detroit made sure they weren\'t left out of the free agent frenzy, by adding cornerback Justin Coleman and star pass rusher Trey Flowers. Meanwhile, it seems to be business as usual for the Chicago Bears, as they still have one of the NFL\'s most prominent defenses, with Khalil Mack leading the way.           Based on everything mentioned, this could be one of the tougher divisions going into this season. Here\'s how I believe every NFC North team will fare, record-wise, in 2019!  #1 Chicago Bears: 11-5 Last season, NFL offenses took center stage and gave fans an abundance of performances that no one will forget in a trice. With star players such as Patrick Mahomes and Andrew Luck creating personalized highlight-reels on a weekly basis, the idea of having a dominant defense seemed to be put on the back-burner fairly quickly. Well, unless you were the Chicago Bears, that is. Behind this proponent group of players with Khalil Mack, Leonard Floyd, Roquan Smith, Kyle Fuller and others, they made sure the phrase \'dominant defense\' went from being irrelevant, to relevant in a matter of weeks.     This was a defense that no one wanted to play, as they quickly climbed their way to becoming what many believed to be the scariest unit in the entire league. Behind now former DC Vic Fangio, Chicago\'s defense ranked 1st in points allowed per game with 17.7, 3rd in total yards allowed per game with 299, 7th in passing yards allowed per game with 219.7, and 1st in rushing yards allowed per game with 80.0. The quality play and numbers for this defense last season is about as conclusive of evidence as you need to see. They are no laughing matter. And I haven\'t even mentioned the offense and its major improvements behind first-year head coach Matt Nagy. I have no concerns with this Bears\' defense. I do, however, have yet to see Mitchell Trubisky take that \'next step\' in becoming THE guy for Chicago. Now, that\'s not on an indictment on his potential. Trubisky\'s 24:12 TD:INT ratio and 95.4 QBR is pretty good, if you ask me. I would personally like to see that improve over time. And I think it will.     Here\'s the other thing, too, Trubisky doesn\'t have to be perfect. Where he lacks in arm strength he makes up for in mobility. The weapons on offense are in place, and the defense is arguably the best in football. It\'s simple: All Trubisky has to do is utilize what he\'s been given to his advantage, and the Bears could be legit Super Bowl contenders this season. That said, I think there are other teams that currently are better suited at the quarterback position. Even still, I\'m critical, not stupid. Picking the Bears to win their division is a foregone conclusion. They may not be the NFC\'s top seed, but look for them to win 11 games this season and still be one of the tougher teams to beat as well. #2 Green Bay Packers: 10-6 Aaron Rodgers     I love what the Packers did this offseason. Green Bay, who\'ve been reluctant to be big spenders in free agency since the start of the Aaron Rodgers era, finally went out and ACTUALLY gave Rodgers some help defensively. They added two pass rushing linebackers in Za\'Darius Smith and Preston Smith, along with star safety Adrian Amos. Amos, who\'s had three interceptions and a combined 274 tackles over his short stint with the Bears, is sure to bring those same elite talents to Lambeau Field this season. Despite suffering what many thought to be a torn ACL during Week 1 last season, Rodgers overcame the knee injury and still managed to throw for over 4,000 yards and garner a 25:2 TD:INT ratio, too. If Rodgers can return to the field 100% healthy, especially with new offensive head coach Matt LeFleur at the helm, I fully expect him to be in the front-running for the MVP race this season.     Yes, the offense has been drastically improved compared to last season, and the defense finally has some big-time talent, but I don\'t think that\'ll be enough to dethrone the reigning NFC North champions Chicago Bears. Not yet, anyway. I do, however, expect the Packers to win at least ten games this season and make the playoffs for the first time since 2016. #3 Minnesota Vikings: 8-8 Kirk Cousins After a disappointing season, in which many people, myself included, expected the Vikings to be a playoff team, they finished the 2018 season with a very disappointing 8-7-1 record. Going into this season, their defense is still among the NFL\'s best, there\'s no denying that. However, I still have major concerns with their offensive line, despite drafting center Garrett Bradbury this past April.     The offensive line was, without a doubt, the Vikings\' biggest issue last season. The group tied with division-rival Detroit Lions for surrendering the tenth-most sacks in 2018 with 40, which isn\'t exactly something to be proud of. Anyway, even behind a treacherous offensive line, Kirk Cousins still managed to throw for over 4,000 yards and garner a 30:10 TD:INT ratio with a 99.7 QBR. Don\'t let these numbers fool you, though. Kirk Cousins had his fair share of struggles last season. Granted, the offensive line woes certainly didn\'t help Cousins. But, similar to Mitchell Trubisky, I think now\'s the time for Cousins to become that force multiplier the Vikings expect him to be, and ultimately prove that he is worth that 3-year, $84 million contract the team gave him two offseasons ago. It pretty much goes without saying that the play of Kirk Cousins and this ""improved"" offensive line is going to be vital in the Vikings\' amount of success this season. That said, I don\'t believe this line is improved enough to handle either Green Bay\'s, Chicago\'s, or Detroit\'s defenses this season. For these reasons listed above, I don\'t see the Vikings winning more than eight games this season.     #4 Detroit Lions: 7-9 Matt Stafford The Lions have been longing for a playoff berth since 2016. Adding defensive end Trey Flowers could turn out to be a phenomenal move, should he be able to amass similar production from when he was in New England. Cornerback Justin Coleman is an intriguing addition, who should pair nicely with elite corner Darius Slay, too. But I kind of feel like we as fans have the same song stuck in our heads titled: ""Will Matt Stafford ever win a playoff game?"" I mean, it\'s been over ten years since he was drafted #1 overall back in the 2009 draft. Granted, he didn\'t have the greatest amount of talent around him. Hell, he waited over five years before he finally got his first 1,000-yard rusher. Even with the new additions, I just think we\'re looking at the same 7-win Lions team that we\'ve been accustomed to seeing since the Matt Stafford tenure began. The Lions have some nice pieces, but the other three teams are light years ahead of them when we think about the overall depth and stability of their roster. For these reasons, I\'d expect the Lions to win no more than seven games this season.

Mitchell Trubisky  Mitchell Trubisky and fans everywhere have had their first big bite of the 2022-23 NFL season. After two games, fans and pundits have their earliest indications of what teams could be destined for greatness, while others brace for the worst.  By midseason, the greats, the almosts, and those preparing for 2023 will be engaging in trade talks with star players.        Fortunes could be flipped on their heads as one player ditches one jersey for another. Here are five trades that could change the fate of teams across the league this season.           #1 New England Patriots trade Jonnu Smith and a second-round pick to Philadelphia Eagles for Quez Watkins NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Philadelphia Eagles v Tampa Bay Buccaneers The Patriots could be hovering around .500 as the trade deadline approaches. One aspect of the team that is missing is a deep-threat option. They have plenty of possession receivers who can run routes as well as anyone. They, however, do not have anyone who can take the top off the defense like Quez Watkins.      Jonnu Smith has lost the starting job to Hunter Henry and could be seen as trade bait for the right team. Zack Cox@ZackCoxNESNPatriots also ran behind Strange on almost every play of their game-clinching drive. Big performance by the rookie. twitter.com/BenFennell_NFL‚Ä¶Ben Fennell@BenFennell_NFLSo so impressed with Pats rookie Cole Strange today‚Ä¶ Some big boy 1-on-1 reps vs Cam Heyward104573 The Eagles are not locked in with their current tight end room. Dallas Goedert leads the room, and several unknowns sit behind him. Of course, a deep threat receiver costs a premium, which is why a second-round pick would be necessary. The Patriots have sold out in free agency before, so a jump to the trade block wouldn\'t be too big of a leap.     #2 Green Bay Packers trade Jordan Love and a second-round pick to Washington Commanders for Terry McLaurin Washington Football Team v New York Giants The Jordan Love experiment effectively ended after Aaron Rodgers signed his new deal. Meanwhile, the Commanders could quickly cool on Carson Wentz, who lasted just one year in Indianapolis. Adding Love to the roster would help the Commanders considerably as a last-ditch effort to save 2022 and set themselves up well for 2023.     Scott Grodsky@ScottGrodsky#Packers QB Jordan Love (@jordan3love) released a hype video ahead of training camp this week.1313111 Love is still a relatively untested player in the NFL, so the Commanders could jump at the chance for another de facto quality rookie. Meanwhile, it is no secret that the Packers need weapons out wide. Adding Terry McLaurin, who is a 1,000-yard machine in his time in the league, could satiate Rodgers and return the Packers to the class of the NFC. #3 Dallas Cowboys trade third-round pick to Pittsburgh Steelers for Mitchell Trubisky     New England Patriots v Pittsburgh Steelers Cooper Rush may have just upset the Cincinnati Bengals, but there is still a long way to go. Dak Prescott could still miss another seven games or so. Rush simply isn\'t the solution at backup quarterback for the Cowboys over the long haul. Mitchell Trubisky, meanwhile, could be the solution. Andrew Fillipponi@ThePoniExpressOur NFL insider @ProFootballTalk on @937theFan on benching Mitch Trubisky for Kenny Pickett: ""You have to give the people what they want at some point.""26018     With the team receiving praise for their defense, specifically Micah Parsons, there is a tried-and-true formula to winning with Trubisky. Trubisky went 12-4 and made the playoffs twice with a great defense when he was with the Bears. He was also a backup quarterback last season.    With Prescott\'s injury issues becoming apparent, it is clear the team needs a premium at the backup quarterback spot. Trubisky could be that guy. Put simply, the trade makes sense on a number of levels.     #4 Seattle Seahawks trade Geno Smith and a fifth-round pick to Pittsburgh Steelers for Mitchell Trubisky Los Angeles Rams v Seattle Seahawks Geno Smith may have started hot against the Denver Broncos on Monday Night Football, but the Seahawks have been effectively shut down since the end of the first half of that game. The preseason made it clear that Drew Lock is not the solution. However, Mitchell Trubisky could come for free with the right offer.        The Steelers don\'t need a quarterback controversy between Trubisky and Pickett once the rookie eventually takes over, so a trade makes sense to keep order. Meanwhile, the Seahawks aim to run the ball, play defense, and win without asking the quarterback to do too much. That is effectively what the Steelers quarterback has made a career of doing. The trade makes sense for both sides. #5 Tennessee Titans trade Derrick Henry to Las Vegas Raiders for Davante Adams     Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Tennessee Titans This could turn the division race on its head. Rumors swirled that Josh Jacobs was on his way out after he played late into the preseason while other starters sat. Meanwhile, the Titans elected to lean on their running game when they chose to trade AJ Brown to the Eagles during the NFL Draft.   Now at 0-2, both teams could be questioning their philosophy. Swapping one of the best wide receivers in the NFL for one of the best running backs in the NFL would allow both teams to quickly pivot their offensive philosophies to catch up in their respective divisions.     ', 'Kenny Pickett- Steelers smokescreen in the NFL Draft  The Pittsburgh Steelers shocked everyone last Thursday night in the first round of the 2022 NFL draft when they selected Kenny Pickett as the 20th-overall pick.  Peter King spoke about the Steelers drafting Pickett on The Herd with Colin Cowherd. King said that Pittsburgh were always sold on Pickett and put out every smoke screen, so teams didn\'t know how interested they were in him. King said:        ""As far as a football fit goes, I can tell you that they have been sort of interested in Kenny Pickett for a long time. They obviously didn\'t want anybody to know because they didn\'t want to have to trade up for it. So they put out every smokescreen there was.""           He went on to describe how they did it: ""They went and had a great meal with Malik Willis and all these other guys but they knew for quite a while that this is the guy they really want."" There were several reports that the Steelers were interested in other top quarterbacks. Ian Rapoport tweeted on April 6th that Pittsburgh were one of the most interested teams in Cincinnati quarterback Desmond Ridder. Ian Rapoport@RapSheetThe #Steelers have been one of the most interested teams when it comes to QB draft prospects and it all picks up soon: Cincinnati QB Desmond Ridder flies to PIT tonight for a visit tomorrow and then UNC QB Sam Howell has his #Steelers visit on Friday.

Mike Tomlin stated that Pickett is ready for the NFL and loves how he\'s a ridiculous competitor. Tomlin said: ""We thought he had pro-level anticipation. We thought he had pro-level accuracy. Often times, those are two variables that really require a lot of adjustment from a quarterbacking standpoint. We felt he came ready-made in those ways. Hopefully, that\'s an asset to him in terms of being able to compete and being ready, if his performance dictates it. "" He went on to say: ""One of the things that was very evident about Kenny being next door is he\'s just a ridiculous competitor, so we\'re just excited about putting him in the mix and watching him compete against Mitch and Mason and seeing where that leads us.""     Pittsburgh signed Mitchell Trubisky to a two-year deal in the off-season as insurance for the position. It will be a battle between Pickett and Trubisky in training camp to see who wins the starting job.Pittsburgh finished last season 9-7-1 before being eliminated 42-21 by the Kansas City Chiefs in the wildcard round. The Steelers will be looking to hit the ground running with a new quarterback, following Roethlisberger\'s retirement.     ', ""NFL: 5 best replacements for Ben Roethlisberger at the Pittsburgh Steelers\xa0  Earlier during the offseason, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger restructured his contract to help with his team's cap situation.  In doing so, Roethlisberger also ensured he'll be returning to the fold in the Steel City come September 9th as the starting quarterback. But after 16 fantastic years in the NFL, it's hard to imagine that Roethlisberger has too many more championship-caliber years left in him.        Currently, Mason Rudolph is the Steelers' backup quarterback. If you happened to catch his 2019 performances when filling in for the injured Roethlisberger, then you'll already know they fell beneath the high standards expected in Pittsburgh.           The experience may have aided his progression. But, personally, I don't think Rudolph is the solution in the long term. This of course begs the question of who Roethlisberger's successor will eventually be? Let's take a look. Five potential replacements for Ben Roethlisberger The Steelers have signed Ben Roethlisberger to a new contract, per @RapSheet 24th highest-graded QB in 2020 (69.0) pic.twitter.com/DQMUUJ4mEK‚Äî PFF (@PFF) March 4, 2021     #1 - Marcus Mariota (Las Vegas Raiders) Marcus Mariota 2014 Heisman Award-winning QB Marcus Mariota has struggled to live up to expectations in his NFL career. In Tennessee, his abilities seemed to wane year on year and it was no surprise to see him moved on to the Las Vegas Raiders during the 2020 offseason. Mariota has been back up to Derek Carr ever since. That being said, there are two reasons why this signing could work for the Steelers. First, Mariota is out of contract at the end of the 2021 season and has enough experience under his belt to come in and do a job and second, in the one-game viewers really got to see off Mariota last season, he performed quite well.         This performance does suggest that coach Gruden's influence on one of the best college players of all time has been paying off. Besides which, if all else fails, Mariota can simply keep the passing game simple and hand the ball off to Najee Harris, who looks destined to have a tremendous career in the NFL. #2 - Carson Strong (Nevada)        Of all the quarterbacks I've seen this week in preparation for next year's 2022 NFL draft, the Nevada Wolf Pack's signal-caller Carson Strong is certainly the closest to Roethlisberger's style of play. He is potentially a college talent that the Steelers will keep an eye on. Like Roethlisberger, Strong is a traditional pocket-passer blessed with a gun of an arm, accurate delivery, and, at 6-foot-4, a real presence behind the line. Of course, the Steelers could vouch for a host of other quarterbacks in next year's draft. But with 5,193 yards, 38 TDs and just 11 picks in his first two campaigns as a starter in Nevada, Mike Tomlin and co. could do a lot worse than Carson Strong in their quest to replace Roethlisberger. #3 - Drew Lock or Teddy Bridgewater (Denver Broncos) Denver Broncos v Atlanta Falcons     With Drew Lock now vying with the former-Panther, Teddy Bridgewater, for quarterback supremacy in Denver. One of the two signal-callers will likely be deemed surplus to requirements come the 2022 offseason. Teddy Bridgewater threw for 3,733 passing yards, 15 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for Carolina in 2020. Drew Lock managed 2,933 passing yards, 16 touchdowns and 15 picks for the Broncos. With those stats, neither player is likely to pacify a Steelers fanbase used to watching such talents as Terry Bradshaw and Ben Roethlisberger at Heinz Field. But both would be decent stop-gap options if coach Tomlin and GM Kevin Colbert feel there isn't value for them in the 2022 NFL draft. #4 - Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers) Aaron Rodgers is reportedly not happy with the Packers and he has told the organization he does not want to return to the team, per @AdamSchefter Rodgers: PFF's highest-graded player in 2020 (95.1) pic.twitter.com/xTHVEAlZBF‚Äî PFF (@PFF) April 29, 2021     Aaron Rodgers wants out of Green Bay. The Pittsburgh Steelers franchise is one of the most renowned and storied in sports. If the quarterback is granted his wish, I'd expect to see the Steelers sniffing around for the 2020 NFL MVP and the quarterback reciprocating the interest. It probably won't happen, but the Steelers have as good a chance as any other team of persuading Rodgers to join their ranks and, of course, he'd be an excellent replacement for Roethlisberger. #5 - Mitchell Trubisky (Buffalo Bills) Mitchell Trubisky: 63.5 PFF Grade in 2020T-32nd among QBs pic.twitter.com/6eOYBFqsJ6‚Äî PFF (@PFF) March 18, 2021     Bear with me here. For all the hate he receives for not being Patrick Mahomes, Mitchell Trubisky has still thrown almost twice as many touchdowns as he has interceptions in his short career. He's been to the playoffs twice and he's young enough to improve further whilst learning a more dynamic style of offense under Sean McDermott and Brian Daboll at the Bills training center. And who knows what kind of tricks he'll pick up from Josh Allen over in Buffalo, too. Like my first pick Marcus Mariota, I just don't think Trubisky is over and done with in the NFL just yet. Someone will give him another opportunity, so why not the Steelers next year if Roethlisberger retires?Trubisky lining up alongside RB Najee Harris, WRs JuJu Smith-Schuster, Chase Claypool and Diontae Johnson doesn't sound all that bad to me.Plus, it's not like Roethlisberger didn't have a nightmare season back in 2006 (18 touchdowns, 23 interceptions). Players can improve, and Trubisky deserves another shot.     Also Read: Who is Ben Roethlisberger's Wife, Ashley Harlan?      "", ""Five NFL quarterbacks who will hit free agency in 2024 feat. Kirk Cousins  In the generation where quarterbacks' yearly wages are an all-time high, some NFL teams have to bite the bullet to stay competitive. Some NFL teams panic and think about security rather than ability and some bring in QB's as depth or leaders to young team-mate quarterbacks. Let's take a look at five free agents for 2024 and what their fate might be.  #1 - Kirk Cousins        Kirk Cousins is, by far, the most expensive quarterback on this list. Cousins is guaranteed to earn $35 million in 2023. This comes off the back of signing a three-year, $84 million deal in 2018, followed by a two-year, $66 million deal. Cousins has led the Vikings to the playoffs twice in 2019 and 2022. The Vikings pulled off a win in the 2019 divisional round after a game-winning drive led by Cousins in overtime, before getting run all over by the 49ers the next week.           Cousins had good seasons in 2020 and 2021 but missed the playoffs in both of those years. The Vikings rebounded in 2022 making the playoffs, but Cousins and Co. crumbled in their first playoff game against the Giants. The Vikings selected QB Jaren Hall in the fifth round of the 2023 draft. He is probably not their next franchise quarterback, but his selection shows they are ready for a change at the position. There is no world where Cousins returns to the Vikings after the 2023 season.     #2 - Ryan Tannehill Tennessee Titans v Los Angeles Chargers The Titans made their plans clear in the 2022 draft, selecting QB Will Levis in the second round. Tannehill is guaranteed $29.5 million in 2023. Tannehill only played 12 games last season and missed the win and in game against the Jaguars in Week 18. As a result of the loss, the Titans missed the playoffs after going one and done as the one seed the previous year. With the Titans' new stadium being approved, it's clear Ryan Tannehill will never play there as a Titans QB. Will Levis will be the starting quarterback for the Titans in 2024 for sure. However, a change mid-season can't be ruled out whether for a Tannehill injury or poor performance.     #3 - Mitchell Trubisky Pittsburgh Steelers v Baltimore Ravens The cult hero signed with the Steelers in 2022 and became their starter after Big Ben's retirement. Meanwhile, rookie QB Kenny Pickett would sit for a year and learn. However, that is not how things played out. Trubisky exited the fourth game of the season due to injury. He would feature in a win over Tampa Bay and games against Baltimore and Carolina, but Pickett is the man going forward in Pittsburgh.     Trubisky will have to sit behind Pickett in 2023. Trubisky's only hope of playing is if Pickett gets injured along the way. Trubisky will take his guaranteed $7 million dollars and will have to look for a new team in 2024. #4 - Marcus Mariota Pittsburgh Steelers v Atlanta Falcons Mariota was a starter in 2023 with a Falcons offense well suited to him. The team drew up a lot of handoffs to running backs and QB run plays for Mariota. An ok season for Mariota was tampered with because he missed the final four games due to injury, and rookie QB Desmond Ridder played in Mariota's place.     Arthur Smith confirmed in the 2023 off-season Ridder would be the starting QB for the Falcons in 2023, which enabled Mariota to move to the Eagles during the 2023 free agency period to serve as backup to Jalen Hurts. Mariota is well suited to the Eagles' offensive scheme but so is newly-paid Jalen Hurts. Mariota may play if Hurts gets injured in 2023. At $5 million guaranteed and a scheme fit, I think the Eagles will keep Mariota as backup past 2023. #5 - Nick Foles Super Bowl LII - Philadelphia Eagles v New England Patriots     The only quarterback of these five to lead a team to a Super Bowl win, Foles will always be a legend in Philadelphia. The Eagles QB almost did it again in 2018, when the team was moments away from going to the NFC Championship game. Foles had two irrelevant years in 2020 and 2021 with the Jaguars and Bears. Foles signed for the Colts in 2022.Foles only played two games in 2022 behind Matt Ryan. The Colts selected QB Anthony Richardson with the fourth pick of the 2023 draft. This allows Nick Foles to take his guaranteed $3 million dollars and either find another team or head to retirement as a Super Bowl winner and Super Bowl MVP.     "", ""5 NFL teams who could exceed expectations in the 2023 season ft. Steelers  For fans of NFL teams, expectations are among the easiest to gauge but the hardest to achieve. When a team sets lofty goals like being Super Bowl contenders but fails to reach even the playoffs, disappointment undoubtedly ensues.   When a team has only modest goals like winning more games than the previous year but somehow manages to go deep in the playoffs, excitement ensues.         These five teams could surprise NFL analysts with a stellar 2023 campaign.            #5 Pittsburgh Steelers Kenny Pickett looks to improve from his rookie season Last season marked a new chapter for the Steelers, as it was their first without the now-retired Ben Roethlisberger. In his place, Mitchell Trubisky and Kenny Pickett fought for the starting spot, which the latter won.  Pickett went a respectable 7-5 as a starter, but concussions and costly interceptions, especially at the Miami Dolphins in Week 7, ultimately doomed the team's playoff hopes.      But with a new protector in Broderick Jones, he could see his TD-INT ratio improve, and the Steelers could remain within the playoff periphery.  #4 Arizona Cardinals Paris Johnson Jr. could be the difference maker in the Cardinals' offense Injuries derailed the Cardinals' 2022 campaign. Quarterback Kyler Murray, tight end Zach Ertz, offensive tackle DJ Humphries and safety Budda Baker were on IR by the time the team concluded its campaign with seven straight losses, tied for the most in franchise history.  Now, with everyone hopefully healthy, the Cardinals are looking to regroup, and they have seemingly found their savior: offensive tackle Paris Johnson Jr.      The No. 10 pick was a member of C.J. Stroud's security blanket and performed well, and the brand-new head coach/general manager tandem of Jonathan Gannon and Monti Ossenfort will hope that he can do the same with Murray and return them to the playoffs after a year away.  #3) Chicago Bears Justin Fields could be the Chicago Bears' newest star quarterback The quarterback has never been a strong area for the defensively-minded Bears, but Justin Fields could change all that.  Amidst the team's struggles last year, Fields established himself as one of the league's best-rushing quarterbacks, becoming just the third at the position to rush for over 1,000 yards in one season.      GM Ryan Poles reaffirmed his faith in him by trading the No. 1 pick to the Carolina Panthers for wide receiver DJ Moore, who joins a very potent playmaking unit enabled by rookie offensive tackle Darnell Wright.  Together, the Bears could make a serious play for at least the Wild Card.  #2) Denver Broncos A new coaching situation could return Russell Wilson to the playoffs The Broncos' performance last season is easily one of the most shocking in NFL history, as a projected Super Bowl contender crashed and burned all the way down to the AFC West's worst record.      Star quarterback Russell Wilson was, arguably not undeservedly, mentioned as a scapegoat but head coach Nathaniel Hackett did not exactly help his case with very dubious decision-making.  But that is all in the past now, and with one-time Super Bowl champion Sean Payton at the helm, Wilson could rediscover his own Super Bowl-winning form.  #1) Carolina Panthers Bryce Young could be the superstar that the new-look Carolina Panthers need Remember when Cam Newton was the most exciting quarterback in the NFL? Those times are long in the past, but the Panthers may have just found his spiritual successor.  Thanks to a trade with the Chicago Bears, Bryce Young may very well be Carolina's savior. No other quarterback arguably has his winning mentality. Furthermore, in a division as weak as the NFC South, a decent offensive core is perhaps the only ingredient needed for the team's first division title since 2015 and playoff appearance since 2017.

Winning often depends on them, and when results aren‚Äôt going well, they are the first to be blamed. The start of the 2022 NFL season has produced some sensational QB play across the league. However, this hasn‚Äôt necessarily spread to every team.  Several quarterbacks have struggled in the 2022 campaign. Whether it be through lacking rhythm with a new team or being out of their depth, some players are letting their teams down.        Here are the five NFL quarterbacks who have struggled the most in the first four weeks:           #5. Russell Wilson - Denver Broncos The grass away from Seattle has been far from green for Russell Wilson Russell Wilson has had average numbers in the opening four weeks of the NFL season. But when you look at how dismal the Denver Broncos‚Äô offense has been, it‚Äôs difficult to not judge Wilson harshly. He was expected to come into the team as the missing piece. Denver have been a QB short of a deep NFL playoff run for years. Wilson, though, has yet to find his connection with the team.     Nathaniel Hackett as a coach is mostly to blame for this. He isn‚Äôt a good offensive play-caller and has given Wilson few opportunities to succeed. This partnership isn‚Äôt blossoming and may become an issue for the Broncos‚Äô front-office before the end of the season. Wilson isn‚Äôt being allowed to play as freely as he wishes and his performances have suffered. Bleacher Report@BleacherReportGeno Smith has been outplaying Russell Wilson this season so far  @brgridiron237081416 #4. Justin Fields - Chicago Bears Justin Fields is teetering dangerously close to the black hole that Chicago QBs have inhabited for years     Justin Fields has endured a testing start to the 2022 NFL season. He is a fundamental cog within an offense that lacks playmakers. Receiver Allen Robinson hasn‚Äôt been replaced and Fields just hasn‚Äôt had the targets to throw to. As such, his play has been erratic as he's trying to force passes. He is scrambling too much, taking sacks, and rushing throws as he panics under the pressure of a collapsing pocket. Fields has a lot of natural talent and the Chicago Bears were high on him in the draft for a reason. However, they haven‚Äôt recruited the supporting cast to help him thrive. Fields hasn‚Äôt thrown a touchdown since Week 1. Furthermore, he has thrown a total of four interceptions this season. #3. Baker Mayfield - Carolina Panthers Baker Mayfield has been wildly inaccurate in his 4 games as a Panther     The Carolina Panthers look like one of the worst teams in the NFL after four games. They are 1-3 and have yet to get anything going with Baker Mayfield under center. It was an offseason of change in Carolina and the trade for Mayfield wasn‚Äôt made till quite late. He missed most of mini-camp and is looking like he needs more time to adjust to the offense. Despite having thrown a single touchdown pass in every game so far, Mayfield‚Äôs accuracy has been abysmal. He has thrown a total of 117 passes and completed just 64 of them. That is around 54%. He has also fumbled the ball six times in four games. You‚Äôre not going to win many games in the NFL with a quarterback putting up numbers like this. It just doesn't happen. You can‚Äôt necessarily put too much blame on the offense around him in Carolina. The reality is that Mayfield simply hasn‚Äôt settled and is playing exceedingly poorly.     #2. Davis Mills - Houston Texans Second season syndrome has hit Davis Mills hard The opening four games of the 2022 NFL season have been a test for Davis Mills. He impressed in a difficult 2021 campaign for the Houston Texans, showing flashes of brilliance. However, he hasn‚Äôt been able to carry that momentum into the new season. Defenses seem to have worked him out. You always fear for QBs that come into the league without much college hype. It rarely works out for them unless they are a generational talent. Mills earned a lot of plaudits in 2021 simply for being a calm head in a chaotic franchise who could throw safely and make gains.     Talk of him being a long-term replacement for Deshaun Watson now seems premature. Mills is suffering now because his 2021 performances gave people expectations that were greater than his talent. His completion percentage stands at 57. Defenses know that to stop Mills, you just rush the pocket and make him panic. He doesn‚Äôt have the requisite vision to defeat this style of defense and it‚Äôs going to be a long season for the Texans. #1. Mitchell Trubisky - Pittsburgh Steelers Trubisky can't replace Big Ben in Pittsburgh     Mitchell Trubisky pips Davis Mills to the unwanted top spot in this list due to the fact that the former Bears QB does have NFL talent. He‚Äôs never going to be a solid starter in a contending team, but if Kirk Cousins can have an NFL career, then there's no reason why Trubisky can‚Äôt. This career, though, won‚Äôt be with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Having already been usurped by Kenny Pickett, Steelers fans will be hoping they‚Äôve seen the last of Trubisky. Two touchdowns and two interceptions in four games is hardly a glowing stat line. His performances just give no confidence to the offense around him and the Steelers shouldn‚Äôt be performing this poorly with their current roster. Trubisky has been part of the problem. He can‚Äôt lead an elite offense as he struggles to make plays under pressure and takes too many unnecessary hits when he can release the ball sooner.     It was an experiment worth trying by Mike Tomlin after Ben Roethlisberger‚Äôs retirement. They didn‚Äôt know which quarterbacks would be around in the draft and had to get someone with experience in the league. Trubisky hasn‚Äôt surprised anyone or exceeded expectations and can expect to find a different franchise in 2023. Josh Carney@ByJoshCarneyThis is what I've been talking about when criticizing Mitch Trubisky. He simply was not seeing the field well, and quite frankly, never has. Throws have been there all season long. He just doesn't pull the trigger. Say what you want about Canada, but scheme is fine. twitter.com/TriggeredWise/‚Ä¶Tyler Wise@TriggeredWiseThe difference between Pickett and Trubisky. #Steelers11711      Quick Links       Houston Texans   Denver Broncos   Pittsburgh Steelers   Carolina Panthers   Russell Wilson   Mitchell Trubisky        More from Sportskeeda       Edited by John Maxwell         √ó               Feedback  Thank You!

Performances in OTA‚Äôs and training camps will determine the order of depth charts across the league. Here I take a look at the NFC North, which consists of the Packers, Lions, Vikings and Bears and see which players will be starting at the fantasy-relevant positions.          Chicago Bears           Chicago Bears v Baltimore Ravens QB ‚Äì Mitchell Trubisky There has been a lot of hype about Trubisky this offseason, after the appointment of Matt Nagy and reinforcements being made in the receiving corps. Trubisky had a relatively poor rookie campaign, but he wasn‚Äôt helped by a terrible group of receivers. He finished as the QB28 last year but is being drafted as the 24th QB off of the board in mock drafts this offseason. He‚Äôs locked in as the starting quarterback for the Chicago Bears, but it remains to be seen whether Trubisky can truly cut it at NFL level.      RB1 ‚Äì Jordan Howard Howard seems to get a lot of unwarranted hate in the fantasy world, despite finishing as the RB15 in an awful offense last year. Yes, he struggled with his catching, but he still rushed for over 1100 yards and 9 TDs. His worth is a little lower in PPR leagues as he won‚Äôt be on the field for passing downs. However, he is the clear first and second down back in this offense, which is being labelled as one of the most improved this offseason. RB2 ‚Äì Tarik Cohen Cohen flashed his elite speed and playmaking ability in his rookie year. He will come in for all passing downs and is expected to be utilised more in the offense this year. Head Coach Matt Nagy wants to use him in similar ways that he used Tyreek Hill in Kansas City. This could mean we see more of Cohen lining up out wide and in the slot.     WR1 ‚Äì Allen Robinson Robinson signed with the Bears in Free Agency after the Jaguars surprisingly decided not to Franchise Tag or work out an extension with the talented wideout. Robinson missed the whole 2017 season after tearing his ACL in the first game of the season against the Texans. The Bears will be hoping he can get back to his 2015 form where he caught 14 TDs and racked up 1400 receiving yards. He‚Äôs the undoubted WR1 in this team and should get plenty of volume. WR2 ‚Äì Kevin White White will see plenty of competition here from 2018 draft pick Anthony Miller. White himself was the 7th overall pick in the 2015 draft, but he‚Äôs struggled his whole career with injuries. The talent is there, but there are doubts about whether he can get on the field for a prolonged amount of time. White will go undrafted in the majority of fantasy drafts. WR3 ‚Äì Taylor Gabriel     Gabriel was acquired in Free Agency from the Falcons. He had a poor 2017 season in Atlanta after a promising 2016. He‚Äôs a small, gadget player that can be used in a number of positions. He won‚Äôt have too much fantasy relevance as he hasn‚Äôt had a season with more than 35 receptions. TE ‚Äì Trey Burton Trey Burton was one of the hottest names on the Free Agent market. His play last year in Zach Ertz‚Äôs absence showed he can get it done as the TE1 in the offense. This earned him a 4-year deal worth $32 million. He should have high usage as a redone threat and safety blanket for Trubisky. He could end up being a top 12 TE this year, and a steal in most fantasy drafts. Detroit Lions NFL: DEC 31 Packers at Lions     QB ‚Äì Matthew Stafford Stafford has ditched the ‚Äòinjury prone‚Äô tag that he‚Äôd acquired in his first few seasons, by not missing a game in the last 7 seasons. He‚Äôs a solid starter for fantasy purposes, as he‚Äôs locked in for over 4000 passing yards every year. His current ADP has him going at around the 100th pick. RB1 ‚Äì Kerryon Johnson Johnson joins somewhat of a backfield committee in Detroit, but I see him securing the early down work before the regular season starts. The product out of Auburn was selected in the second round by the Lions, who traded up to get their man. Teams don‚Äôt usually spend that amount of draft capital, without giving the player a shot at the starters job. RB2 ‚Äì LeGarrette Blount Blount, who has won consecutive SuperBowl rings with New England and Philadelphia, signed with the Lions in Free Agency, before the draft. He is likely to get some goal-line work as the power back and will be fantasy relevant in deeper fantasy leagues. I don‚Äôt see Blount getting too many carries if Johnson excels, especially as Theo Riddick will come in on passing downs.     WR1 ‚Äì Marvin Jones Jr Jones had a strong 2017 season for the Lions, finishing as a WR1 by being the 11th ranked Wide Receiver on the season. He showed his excellent catching ability by having one of the best catch rates on contested catches, in the league. I can see Jones replicating last season‚Äôs tally of 9 TDs, whilst improving on his 61 catches. WR2 ‚Äì Golden Tate Tate is a great PPR option, finishing just 1 place behind Jones in last years rankings. He caught 92 passes and recorded over 1000 receiving yards. He is locked in as Stafford‚Äôs slot receiver and favourite target, meaning he will have another productive year in terms of fantasy points. WR3 ‚Äì Kenny Golladay Golladay showed good promise in his rookie year, despite suffering with niggling injuries. HIs excellent route running should see him gaining more than the 48 targets he received last year. He will only be relevant in deeper leagues.     TE ‚Äì Luke Willson Willson was brought in from Seattle and should replace the departed Eric Ebron, as the TE1 in the Lions offense. Stafford hasn‚Äôt been known to produce high scoring fantasy tight ends, and I don‚Äôt see this season being any different. Willson is little more than an occasional plug and play option in 12 team leagues. Green Bay Packers Green Bay Packers v Cleveland Browns QB ‚Äì Aaron Rodgers The man is back! After missing the majority of the 2017 season with a broken collarbone, Rodgers is back atop QB fantasy rankings. He‚Äôs locked in to throw 30 TDs, and can add 300+ yards on the ground. Expect him to finish in the top 2 or 3 QBs come the end of the season.     RB1 ‚Äì Aaron Jones There are conflicting reports coming out of Green Bay at the moment, regarding the Running Backs. I think Aaron Jones will come out on top and start the season as the lead back. He showed his ability when given the chance last season, averaging 5.5 yards per carry on 81 attempts. If he can stay injury free, then he could be in for a big season. RB2 ‚Äì Jamaal Williams Williams will push for the starters role with Jones and will have fantasy relevance in 10-12 team leagues. He wasn‚Äôt as efficient as Jones last year, but given the chance with Rodgers at the helm, he could exceed his 2017 output. Don‚Äôt forget about Ty Montgomery. Montgomery started 2017 as the workhorse before injury derailed his season. There is a slight chance he could trump the two young guns or even turn this backfield into a 3 headed attack, which would frustrate fantasy owners everywhere.     WR1 ‚Äì Davante Adams Adams steps into the WR1 role for the first time, after the departure of Jordy Nelson. Adams, who has the most TDs in the league over the last 2 seasons, signed a 4 year $58 million contract at the end of last year. Expect him to continue his amazing RedZone efficiency throughout the next few seasons. WR2 ‚Äì Randall Cobb Cobb, who will play mainly from the slot, will need to step up into the WR2 role after the loss of Nelson in the offseason. Cobb has had a couple of down years in terms of fantasy totals, now has the chance to receive more volume and more RedZone looks as the veteran of the WR corps. WR3 ‚Äì Geronimo Allison Allison is currently placed at number 3 on the depth chart for the Green Bay Packers. He has shown he can produce when given the chance and 2018 may be his breakout year. He is available at the back end of all drafts and could be a nice pickup if Rodgers starts to use him more often.     However, he does have plenty of competition behind him, with the Packers signing 3 receivers in the draft. J‚ÄôMon Moore, Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Equanimeous St. Brown will all be pushing to take over the starting role opposite Davante Adams. Keep your eye on how this one develops, as any receiver in an Aaron Rodgers led team could produce good numbers. TE ‚Äì Jimmy Graham Graham, who signed for the Packers in March on a 3 year, $30 million contract, is locked in as the TE1 on this team. Whilst Graham has lost a step in recent years, he remains a valuable RedZone weapon, as shown by his 10 touchdowns last season. With Aaron Rodgers throwing him the ball, expect the former Seahawk to be the 4th or 5th tight end off the board in Fantasy drafts. Minnesota Vikings Chicago Bears v Minnesota Vikings     QB ‚Äì Kirk Cousins The big money acquisition in Free Agency, Kirk Cousins, will look to improve on last year‚Äôs fantasy finish of 6th amongst quarterbacks. Cousins, who signed a fully guaranteed $84 million contract this offseason, comes in to replace Case Keenum in Minnesota. Cousins has a plethora of weapons at his disposal that far exceeds what he had he in Washington. He can be played every week in your fantasy team. RB1 ‚Äì Dalvin Cook Cook had a promising start to his rookie year before it was cut short by injury. He‚Äôs back to health this offseason and will immediately go in as the workhorse back. I expect Cook to be on the field for more passing downs now, following the departure of Jerick McKinnon to the 49ers. RB2 ‚Äì Latavius Murray Murray performed well for the Minnesota Vikings last year in Cook‚Äôs absence. The acquisition from Oakland took on the early down role, and ended up rushing for over 800 yards and scored 8 TDs in the process. Murray has some fantasy value this year, as Cook won‚Äôt play every down, but I see him being a valuable handcuff more than anything.     WR1 ‚Äì Adam Thielen Thielen, who broke out in 2017, will look to continue his high level of play this season. He overtook Diggs as the ‚Äògo to‚Äô weapon in the offense, and consistently produced for fantasy owners each week. It‚Äôll be interesting to see if he strikes up a similar rapport with his new QB. WR2 ‚Äì Stefon Diggs Diggs was outshone by Thielen last year, but will look to retake his spot at the top of the depth chart at some point this season. The hero from the ‚ÄòMiracle in Minneapolis‚Äô play, still had a decent year, ending as the WR19 in PPR leagues. Both receivers will be week in, week out plays for fantasy owners this year. WR3 ‚Äì Laquon Treadwell Treadwell is just ahead of Kendall Wright in the depth chart at this moment. He has flashed some of his potential in the past couple of seasons, but is yet to breakout and contribute on a consistent basis. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if Wright ends up starting ahead of Treadwell, by the start of the season.     TE ‚Äì Kyle Rudolph Last season Rudolph finished as the 8th ranked tight end, with Case Keenum throwing to him. Kirk Cousins has shown in recent years that he likes to use his tight end regularly, whether it‚Äôs been Vernon Davis or Jordan Reed. Rudolph is a pretty dependable tight end, who should end up as a TE1 in fantasy this year.  Do you agree with our list? Who would make your list of projected starters?

56,Kenny Pickett,"[""Kenny Pickett's performance proves Steelers have a potential answer but not solution for Ben Roethlisberger's replacement  Kenny Pickett was selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was the organization's choice to take over as their future franchise quarterback following the retirement of Ben Roethlisberger during the 2022 NFL offseason. Roethlisberger retired after spending his entire 18 year career with the Steelers.  While Pickett would be tasked with filling big shoes, he didn't open the season as the starting quarterback. Instead, the Steelers named Mitchell Trubisky the Week 1 starter after signing him during the 2022 free agency period.        Trubisky struggled in his short time as the starting quarterback for the Steelers, losing two of his first three games. He entered a favorable match-up at home in Week 4 against the New York Jets, but failed to impress. By the end of the first half, the Steelers were trailing by a 10-6 score. This triggered head coach Mike Tomlin to make a change, bringing in rookie Kenny Pickett to replace Trubisky.           Pickett's NFL career got off to the roughest of starts as he threw an interception on his very first passing attempt ever. He would go on to complete ten of his 13 passing attempts for 120 yards, but all three of his incompletions were intercepted by the Jets defense. On a more positive note, Pickett recorded two rushing touchdowns. Dov Kleiman@NFL_DovKleimanThat was quick... Kenny Pickett throws an INT on his first drive in the NFL Was his first pass in the NFL.38362     It was a mixed performance for Pickett, who failed to complete the comeback against the Jets. Instead, the Steelers lost their third consecutive game. While it was only one half, Pickett will need to play much better moving forward. Especially if he's going to follow in Ben Roethlisberger's footsteps, which include two Super Bowl rings.     It's unclear at this point if Kenny Pickett will be named the starting quarterback moving forward or if the Steelers will give Trubisky another shot first, but an announcement by Mike Tomlin can be expected sometime prior to the Week 5 game. It will be a tough task for whoever gets named the starter, facing off against the Buffalo Bills, one of the best teams in the NFL with the top-ranked defense from a season ago.     Which teams passed on Kenny Pickett? Pittsburgh QB Kenny Pickett Pickett was the only quarterback selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft, going to the Steelers with the 20th overall pick. Several teams ahead of the Steelers in the draft order were rumored to be interested in drafting a quarterback in the first round, but ultimately decided to pass on Pickett.         The Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, and Seattle Seahawks all decided to pass on quarterbacks, filling other roster needs instead. Other teams that passed on Pickett in the first round drafted quarterbacks later. These were the Atlanta Falcons (Desmond Ridder), the Carolina Panthers (Matt Corral), and the Washington Commanders (Sam Howell). The Tennessee Titans also decided to take a quarterback later in the draft when Malik Willis fell to them in the third round. They weren't necessarily in the market for one, so didn't really pass on Pickett, but capitalized on drafting Willis for value where they got him. The New England Patriots similarly drafted Bailey Zappe in the fourth round, before a trio of speculative quarterbacks were selected late in the seventh round. Does Kenny Pickett really have small hands? Kenny Pickett at the 2022 NFL Combine     Kenny Pickett's hands measured in at just 8.5 inches during the 2022 NFL Combine. He officially has the smallest hands of any quarterback currently playing in the NFL, making his grip on the football a potential issue moving forward. While his hands are extremely small compared to other NFL quarterbacks, it's debatable how much of an impact that really has on a player's abilities. It's certain that the Steelers would have drafted him if they had any concerns about this. They scouted him thoroughly and would have watched endless tape of his college days before reaching a decision.It was great to see the rookie get on the field, although his debut didn't quite go to plan. We will see him develop and perhaps start some games in the near future.

', 'Kenny Pickett- Steelers smokescreen in the NFL Draft  The Pittsburgh Steelers shocked everyone last Thursday night in the first round of the 2022 NFL draft when they selected Kenny Pickett as the 20th-overall pick.  Peter King spoke about the Steelers drafting Pickett on The Herd with Colin Cowherd. King said that Pittsburgh were always sold on Pickett and put out every smoke screen, so teams didn\'t know how interested they were in him. King said:        ""As far as a football fit goes, I can tell you that they have been sort of interested in Kenny Pickett for a long time. They obviously didn\'t want anybody to know because they didn\'t want to have to trade up for it. So they put out every smokescreen there was.""           He went on to describe how they did it: ""They went and had a great meal with Malik Willis and all these other guys but they knew for quite a while that this is the guy they really want."" There were several reports that the Steelers were interested in other top quarterbacks. Ian Rapoport tweeted on April 6th that Pittsburgh were one of the most interested teams in Cincinnati quarterback Desmond Ridder.

Mike Tomlin stated that Pickett is ready for the NFL and loves how he\'s a ridiculous competitor. Tomlin said: ""We thought he had pro-level anticipation. We thought he had pro-level accuracy. Often times, those are two variables that really require a lot of adjustment from a quarterbacking standpoint. We felt he came ready-made in those ways. Hopefully, that\'s an asset to him in terms of being able to compete and being ready, if his performance dictates it. "" He went on to say: ""One of the things that was very evident about Kenny being next door is he\'s just a ridiculous competitor, so we\'re just excited about putting him in the mix and watching him compete against Mitch and Mason and seeing where that leads us.""     Pittsburgh signed Mitchell Trubisky to a two-year deal in the off-season as insurance for the position. It will be a battle between Pickett and Trubisky in training camp to see who wins the starting job.Pittsburgh finished last season 9-7-1 before being eliminated 42-21 by the Kansas City Chiefs in the wildcard round. The Steelers will be looking to hit the ground running with a new quarterback, following Roethlisberger\'s retirement.     ', 'Who is Kenny Pickett\'s fiancee Amy Paternoster? Future NFL star gets massive support during Combine  Kenny Pickett may or may not impress scouts at the NFL Combine but his fiancee, Amy Paternoster, is definitely dazzled by his performances (and looks) so far. Taking to Instagram, she posted a story commending him on his performances and looks so far, saying that he is ""killing it"".  Absolutely Killing It: Amy Paternoster shares Instagram story about fiance Kenny Pickett        Pickett has shown his brilliance in flashes at the NFL Combine running a 4.67 seconds in the 40 yard dash. He showed elite accuracy, though there was a bit of concern on the deep balls as they tended to hang and slow the receivers down.           Christopher Carter@CarterCritiquesThose deep balls from Kenny Pickett hung a bit and needed the WRs to slow down. That‚Äôs where his biggest knock is when it comes to hand size/throwing power. He‚Äôs the best in this class at accuracy/reading defenses, but that deep ball into tighter NFL windows still a question.7:59 AM ¬∑ Mar 4, 2022658 But that shouldn\'t be too much of a knock on him considering he is better known for his pocket mobility and ability to read defenses. Amy Paternoster certainly seems to think so. Amy Paternoster and Kenny Pickett: the story so far     2021 ACC Championship - Pittsburgh v Wake Forest Kenny Pickett and Amy Paternoster\'s journey started at the University of Pittsburgh. While he was their star quarterback, she engaged herself in a different form of football, playing soccer for the university team. They got engaged right after he had declared for the NFL draft this year. He is expected to be one of the top quarterbacks selected in this class.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Kenny Pickett started 49 games for the Pittsburgh Panthers, winning 33 games. He threw for 12,303 yards during that time and completed 62.4 percent of his attempts by throwing 1045 completions in 1674 attempts. He had 81 touchdowns to 32 interceptions and an average passer rating of 136.3. In 2021, he had a passer rating of 165.3, completing 42 touchdowns for just 7 interceptions. He went 11-2 in 2021. Amy Paternoster has been active with the Pittsburgh Tigers soccer team, playing as an attacking midfielder for them. She has scored three goals and contributed five assists. For the moment, though, it seems she is more concerned with her fiance\'s playing career, as he participates in one of the most important events of his nascent career. It will determine his NFL draft position and his future career. At a time when he has been scrutinized for things beyond his control, like his hand size that measures only 8 1/2 inches and is smaller than any NFL quarterback, knowing that someone unconditionally backs you can mean the world to someone.Pickett is fortunate that he has found such a supportive partner with whom he hopes to spend the rest of his life. She will be hoping that during their time together, she will get more opportunities to cheer on his performances in the NFL.

The Raiders offense mustered only 10 points against a Steelers defense that has given up 22.1 points per game this season. Derek Carr contract: Can the Raiders release him before the 2023 season? The Las Vegas Raiders signed Derek Carr to a three-year, $121.5 million extension in April 2022. But the deal, set to kick in next season, has a clause that gives the Raiders the power to release the quarterback before February 15th and incur only $5 million in dead cap in 2023. The Raiders are 6-9 and doomed to have a losing record this season. They still have a small chance of making it to the playoffs, but it is more likely that the Raiders\' 2022 season is over. Derek Carr has been the franchise\'s cornerstone since he was drafted in 2014, but his nine-year stint with the team could be coming to a close. With Tom Brady set to become a free agent at the end of the season, the Raiders could rekindle their interest in the seven-time Super Bowl champion. That would mean parting ways with their franchise quarterback of almost a decade.     ', 'Report reveals Browns player was unhappy with Baker Mayfield\'s poor performance in training  Baker Mayfield is currently facing a battle for his NFL future, which lies in limbo. He remains on the Cleveland Browns\' roster despite the franchise making it abundantly clear they will be moving forward with Deshaun Watson as their starting quarterback.  A recent report has questioned Mayfield\'s ability and that he was regularly poor in practice, according to an unnamed Browns player. The information contained a quote from a Browns player. The statement addresses a video Odell Beckham Jr.\'s father released on social media in November last year, showing the quarterback not throwing the ball to his son, who was open on several occasions.                View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post           According to the report, when asked if he had seen the video posted by Beckham Jr.\'s father, the unnamed Browns player gave a scathing response. He said: ""Why would I watch the video? I see it every day in practice."" Offseason Chopz@Pchopz_Oh boy.3417478     This is another negative view that could hinder Mayfield\'s search for a new team. With the NFL Draft ending, the chance for the Browns to move him on to pastures new and focus on the future with a different quarterback have also diminished. The Carolina Panthers were interested in Mayfield, but recent reports have shown that they were never close to a deal with the Browns. The Panthers went on to draft Matt Corral, who will challenge Sam Darnold for the starting job in Charlotte.        Other potential teams that needed a quarterback have made moves to find the piece to the puzzle, with the Pittsburgh Steelers drafting Kenny Pickett and the Seattle Seahawks set to move forward with Drew Lock behind center. Seattle head coach Pete Carroll recently stated that the Seahawks weren\'t looking to add another quarterback \'at all\' to their roster, which puts an end to Seattle being a possible destination for Mayfield.  Why are teams reluctant to make a trade for Baker Mayfield? One of the main hurdles is the quarterback\'s $19 million salary due in 2022. Teams seem reluctant to take on that amount, which reportedly led to the Panthers\' and Browns\' inability to agree on trade terms.   It also seems highly unlikely that Mayfield will stay and offer back-up for Watson as he sees himself as the starting quarterback. Based on the NFL Index quarterback rankings, he ranked 25th out of 62 quarterbacks, with his inconsistency proving to be a significant shortcoming.     ', ""5 NFL teams who could exceed expectations in the 2023 season ft. Steelers  For fans of NFL teams, expectations are among the easiest to gauge but the hardest to achieve. When a team sets lofty goals like being Super Bowl contenders but fails to reach even the playoffs, disappointment undoubtedly ensues.   When a team has only modest goals like winning more games than the previous year but somehow manages to go deep in the playoffs, excitement ensues.         These five teams could surprise NFL analysts with a stellar 2023 campaign.            #5 Pittsburgh Steelers Kenny Pickett looks to improve from his rookie season Last season marked a new chapter for the Steelers, as it was their first without the now-retired Ben Roethlisberger. In his place, Mitchell Trubisky and Kenny Pickett fought for the starting spot, which the latter won.  Pickett went a respectable 7-5 as a starter, but concussions and costly interceptions, especially at the Miami Dolphins in Week 7, ultimately doomed the team's playoff hopes.      But with a new protector in Broderick Jones, he could see his TD-INT ratio improve, and the Steelers could remain within the playoff periphery.  #4 Arizona Cardinals Paris Johnson Jr. could be the difference maker in the Cardinals' offense Injuries derailed the Cardinals' 2022 campaign. Quarterback Kyler Murray, tight end Zach Ertz, offensive tackle DJ Humphries and safety Budda Baker were on IR by the time the team concluded its campaign with seven straight losses, tied for the most in franchise history.  Now, with everyone hopefully healthy, the Cardinals are looking to regroup, and they have seemingly found their savior: offensive tackle Paris Johnson Jr.      The No. 10 pick was a member of C.J. Stroud's security blanket and performed well, and the brand-new head coach/general manager tandem of Jonathan Gannon and Monti Ossenfort will hope that he can do the same with Murray and return them to the playoffs after a year away.  #3) Chicago Bears Justin Fields could be the Chicago Bears' newest star quarterback The quarterback has never been a strong area for the defensively-minded Bears, but Justin Fields could change all that.  Amidst the team's struggles last year, Fields established himself as one of the league's best-rushing quarterbacks, becoming just the third at the position to rush for over 1,000 yards in one season.      GM Ryan Poles reaffirmed his faith in him by trading the No. 1 pick to the Carolina Panthers for wide receiver DJ Moore, who joins a very potent playmaking unit enabled by rookie offensive tackle Darnell Wright.  Together, the Bears could make a serious play for at least the Wild Card.  #2) Denver Broncos A new coaching situation could return Russell Wilson to the playoffs The Broncos' performance last season is easily one of the most shocking in NFL history, as a projected Super Bowl contender crashed and burned all the way down to the AFC West's worst record.      Star quarterback Russell Wilson was, arguably not undeservedly, mentioned as a scapegoat but head coach Nathaniel Hackett did not exactly help his case with very dubious decision-making.  But that is all in the past now, and with one-time Super Bowl champion Sean Payton at the helm, Wilson could rediscover his own Super Bowl-winning form.  #1) Carolina Panthers Bryce Young could be the superstar that the new-look Carolina Panthers need Remember when Cam Newton was the most exciting quarterback in the NFL? Those times are long in the past, but the Panthers may have just found his spiritual successor.  Thanks to a trade with the Chicago Bears, Bryce Young may very well be Carolina's savior. No other quarterback arguably has his winning mentality. Furthermore, in a division as weak as the NFC South, a decent offensive core is perhaps the only ingredient needed for the team's first division title since 2015 and playoff appearance since 2017.

With the 2022 NFL Draft approaching, franchises are posturing to find the next generational talent at each position. At quarterback, several potential cornerstones will be eligible and likely selected in the first go-round through the 32 franchises. The most pressing needs under center are for teams like the Carolina Panthers, Houston Texans, and Seattle Seahawks. Every team can be reflective and figure out whether their guy is \'the\' guy moving forward.  The New England Patriots lost their generational quarterback Tom Brady. They had a transitional year with Cam Newton in 2020, setting up the parting of the red seas for Alabama alum Mac Jones. With the Crimson Tide, Jones won the National Championship in 2020, leading the offense for a team so historically dominant due to their defensive studs and skill position powerhouses.        After an initial period of adjusting to Bill Belichick\'s offense, Mac Jones was off and running in 2021, eventually amassing a collection of two 300-yard passing performances and one 299-yard game. New England finished 10-7, with Jones\' merit as a Wild Card round merit being proven.           Unfortunately, the Patriots were less than convincing in a four-score blowout loss against the Buffalo Bills in the first round of this past season\'s postseason. While it doesn\'t beg the question, it certainly makes one wonder about the long-term health of football\'s most important position. Mac Jones would be in a similar draft position at QB in 2022 if he were drafted this year instead of last The NFL Draft has two players (Malik Willis and Kenny Pickett) that will undoubtedly garner attention in the top 10 picks. A third, Matt Corral, would be in the same boat if a Sugar Bowl injury didn\'t complicate things.     Like last year, Mac Jones is solidly the fourth or fifth-best player on the big draft board. His ceiling will only go as high as Belichick\'s, but the trio, as mentioned earlier, could arguably move the needle more when they hit the NFL gridiron this coming season. NFL executives are weighing in and hurling superlatives at the 2022 NFL Draft quarterbacks. According to Tom Pelissero for NFL.com, an AFC general manager called Malik Willis a top potential quarterback in this year\'s class: ""To me, he\'s the No. 1 guy in the class. And for whatever people want to talk about in terms of readiness or all this other stuff ‚Äî it was the same thing with Josh Allen, it was the same thing with Patrick Mahomes. I think people are a little short-sighted with that kid."" Here\'s how an AFC executive described Pickett:     ""Just his demeanor, coming away from center, how he handled everything, Pickett was the most impressive. He was the biggest guy, strongest stature ‚Äî he just felt like a quarterback."" No one ever viewed Mac Jones this way, even when he was winning a title at Alabama during the COVID-19 pandemic season. Matt Corral, Sam Howell, and Desmond Ritter showed more coming into this season and could leave Jones in the dust like a pro with a higher ceiling than the Patriots gunslinger.Only time can settle this debate, but Jones measures as merely average when juxtaposed against the QB elites of this year and last year.

The AFC took the early lead with significant help from Derek Carr, who scored 31 points in the precision competition.  In an effort to improve the All-Star game, the NFL decided to hold the Pro Bowl over two days: February 2nd for the skill competition between the NFC and AFC, and February 5th for the 7-on-7 flag tournament.        This was Carr\'s fourth Pro Bowl invitation in his nine years with the Las Vegas Raiders and he put up an impressive performance.

However, McDaniels stated that the decision was due to the team\'s overall offensive performance and that Carr had played many games, and it was time to see what Stidham could do. As a result, he was made inactive, and the team\'s practice quarterback was promoted to the backup quarterback.

This means that the team will have to cut him before February 15th unless Carr waives his no-trade clause. If they don\'t, the team would have to pay him $40.4 million over the next two years, which is fully guaranteed. The 31-year-old has stated that he will not be extending his contract deadline.

But the Raiders catch a break this week. They travel to MetLife Stadium to take on the winless New York Jets. Many fans think this year's Jets could be one of the worst teams in NFL history.  Quarterback Sam Darnold's return did little to aid the Jets' quest for a victory. Darnold struggled to throw the football with any real consistency. After a 20-3 loss to the Miami Dolphins, New York remains stuck at the bottom of the AFC East. The mere fact that veteran running back Frank Gore is still the Jets' most consistent performer says everything you need to know about this deficient offense.        As for coach Jon Gruden's Raiders, everything seemed to go wrong last week. They were unable to run the ball, so they resorted to a one-dimensional passing offense. To beat the Jets, Las Vegas will have to play better on both offense and defense. With a win, the Raiders' playoff chances remain solid.

He threw three interceptions and completed only 53.3 percent of his passes in that loss. Jarrett Stidham took over as the team\'s starter for the last two regular-season games. Falling to second in the depth chart ended Derek Carr\'s consecutive regular-season games at 91. However, McDaniels has seen enough after eight losses under Carr were by one possession. They also lost five games despite having double-digit halftime leads. After 15 games, Carr had his third-worst passing yards total (3,522) and tied his career-high in interceptions (14). His 60.8 completion percentage is also his second-worst since playing in the NFL. Carr became the Raiders\' all-time leader in passing yards (35,222) and passing touchdowns (217) in nine seasons. He also leads the franchise in fourth-quarter comebacks (28) and game-winning drives (33). The former Fresno State standout is second in wins among Raiders quarterbacks with 63. Derek Carr is hoping for the best for the Raiders     The Raiders released Carr after he declined to waive his no-trade clause. He then signed a four-year, $150 million deal to join the New Orleans Saints. But while wearing a different uniform in 2023, Derek Carr still wishes the best for the organization that gave him a chance. He said in the same Fresno Bee article by Galaviz: ""I\'m happy to be somewhere where we\'re in a stable organization that\'s been proven for years, and I hope that the Raiders find something good there too, where they can keep that stability for the next guys because I know how important it is and I care about my old teammates. ""But for the time being, I\'m just excited to be a part of the Saints organization because they\'ve won at a high level for a long time.""Jimmy Garoppolo will take Carr\'s place as the Raiders starting quarterback. While recovering from a foot injury, he is expected to be ready by the team\'s training camp in July.     ', 'Derek Carr‚Äôs season in review: How did the Raiders get here?  Derek Carr entered the 2022 season as the franchise quarterback for the Las Vegas Raiders with high hopes of reaching the Super Bowl. Fast forward to now and Carr is expected to be traded or released by the Raiders before the end of February.  So how did it come to this? Examining his 2022 campaign yields some interesting talking points.        It was a rough start for the three-time Pro Bowler. Carr was sacked five times in the Raiders\' loss to the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 1 while throwing for two touchdowns and three interceptions.           In the team\'s next two games, Carr threw for a combined 555 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception. He threw for under 200 yards for the first time in the Raiders\' first win of the season over the Denver Broncos in Week 4. From Weeks 5-10, Derek Carr threw for 1,090 yards, seven touchdowns, and an interception. He also completed 63.7 percent of his passes and had a quarterback rating of 96.3.        Carr looked more efficient over the Raiders\' next three games (Weeks 11-13), throwing for 852 yards, seven touchdowns and three interceptions. In Week 11, he threw for a season-high 307 yards along with two touchdowns in the Raiders\' victory over the Broncos. However, the downfall of the former Fresno State Bulldogs star started in Week 14 and he never fully recovered. In Week 14 versus the Los Angeles Rams, Carr threw for 137 yards and two interceptions in the loss. The quarterback looked promising the following week against the New England Patriots, throwing for 231 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception. Ultimately, it was the Week 16 matchup versus the Pittsburgh Steelers at Acrisure Stadium that proved fatal to Carr\'s future with the Raiders. In that game, Derek Carr threw for just 174 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions. It would be the quarterback\'s final start of the season as head coach Josh McDaniels benched him in favor of Jarett Stidham.        Derek Carr ended his ninth season in the NFL by throwing for 3,522 yards, 24 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions. 14 interceptions were tied for the most in the NFL this season and matched his total from last season. This isn\'t horrific by any means and you get the feeling that if the Raiders had started the season brighter things would have been different. The real issue isn\'t just that they failed to make the postseason (which certainly didn\'t help), but that they lost so many games. They went 6-9 with Derek Carr under center and 0-2 without him. A 6-11 season for a team hyped for a deep playoff run seems to have been too much to handle.     Whether Carr is truly at fault is unclear, but Las Vegas needed someone to blame. With a new QB in the 2023 season, HC Josh McDaniels will likely be in trouble if there aren\'t swift improvements in Nevada.  Josh McDaniels on the benching of Derek Carr McDaniels addressed the Raiders quarterback situation and his reasoning for benching Carr in favor of Stidham to reporters. Here\'s what McDaniels said: ""We\'re going to go ahead and start Jarrett [Stidham] the last couple games of the season here. You know, none of us is happy with where we\'re at. But we think it\'s an opportunity to evaluate a younger player who hasn\'t had much time to play. ""Talking to Derek, who was great, he understands the scenario that we\'re in, the situation, and [is] very supportive of the two young guys. ... He\'ll do anything he can to help them. So, that\'s what we\'re going to do.""         Derek Carr says goodbye to the Raiders The 31-year-old said farewell to the Las Vegas Raiders fans and teammates on Instagram. Carr noted how hard it is to say goodbye after nine seasons with the team and his love for the fans and teammates. Here\'s what he said: ""It breaks my heart I didn\'t get an opportunity to say goodbye in person. We certainly have been on a roller coaster in our 9 years together.     ""From the bottom of my heart, I am so grateful and appreciative of the years of support you gave to my family and me. We had our share of both heart breaking moments and thrilling game winning drives, and it always felt like you were there next to me.""    Carr concluded: ""It\'s especially hard to say goodbye because I can honestly say that I gave you everything I had, every single day, in season, and in the off season. It certainly wasn\'t perfect, but I hope that I was able to leave you with more than a few great memories as Raider fans.""     Derek Carr@derekcarrqb‚ò†Ô∏è10494711215 He\'ll leave the Raiders franchise as their all-time leader in passing yards (35,222 yards) and touchdowns (217 touchdowns). In 2017, Derek Carr signed a five-year, $125 million contract extension with the Raiders and then a three-year, $121.5 million extension last spring.He was that taken in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft. The Las Vegas Raiders will look to trade arguably their best quarterback in franchise history this upcoming offseason. As to where Derek Carr will play next season, that is a matter of some debate.     ', ""AFC Offensive Player of the Week: Did Patrick Mahomes deserve to win the award for his Week 1 display?  The NFL has revealed the AFC Offensive Player of the Week, and to some shock, Patrick Mahomes was given the Week 1 honor for his offensive prowess. This comes as a surprise considering that Mahomes is currently sitting at #6 in total yardage for quarterbacks. In isolation, though, that stat line in isolation is a bit misleading.  The Kansas City Chiefs also had their hands full with the tenacity of the Cleveland Browns on Sunday. The Browns were ahead in the game through the first half until Mahomes and company decided to come alive in the third and fourth quarters.                   Why didn't Derek Carr win AFC Player of the Week? Once you break down the stat lines, Derek Carr's displays come to the fore. The Raiders QB played a great game as well in Week 1. He outgained Mahomes' total yardage by 98 yards. Carr is currently #1 in yardage for QBs, with 435 yards. Derek Carr had a stellar performance Monday night after the Las Vegas Raiders beat the Baltimore Ravens in OT. The back-and-forth contest ended in blown TD coverage to Zay Jones. betstamp@betstampThe Raiders complete the comeback and finally win in a crazy game in Las Vegas9:01 AM ¬∑ Sep 13, 2021197     Carr should have been in the running for AFC POTW honors considering he marched his team to an OT victory and the fact that he out-threw Mahomes by 98 yards. However, ending the game with a win doesn't necessarily mean the game was put on the shoulders of the quarterback. The Raiders defense showed up, especially with Maxx Crosby earning AFC Defensive Player of the Week. Crosby had six tackles, two sacks and two tackles for loss. Carr definitely got some help in stopping Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens. NFL@NFLOnly @PatrickMahomes and @Cheetah... WOW.üì∫: #CLEvsKC on CBSüì±: NFL app3:55 AM ¬∑ Sep 12, 20213325763     Mahomes simply makes the throws that most quarterbacks only dream of making. His on-the-run darts to Tyreek Hill, for instance, are a thing of beauty. This is how Mahomes can come back against any team, no matter how much of an uphill battle the Chiefs are facing. Diving deeper into the stats, Mahomes just played a better game than Carr and the rest of the AFC quarterbacks. Although Carr leads the AFC in yardage, Mahomes' passer rating is #1. Joe Burrow's 128.8 is second best. Carr didn't even come close to that number with his 89.5% rating. Mahomes also is tied at three TDs with Trevor Lawrence of the Jacksonville Jaguars. Mahomes and Baker Mayfield are tied for second place in completion rate. Only Teddy Bridgewater posted a better completion rate with 77.8%. Breakdown of Mahomes offensive rankings Yards - 337 (tied for 6th) TDs - 3 (tied for 1st) Completion % - 75.0 % (tied for 2nd) Passer rating - 131.4 (1st)     Mahomes outperformed most other AFC quarterbacks in the offensive categories that just might matter a little more. Touchdowns are what matter most, and the completion rate can be seen as an even bigger stat than most.Mahomes also helped register a comeback victory for the Chiefs. The Cleveland Browns defense is also formidable, so it would be safe to say that Patrick Mahomes definitely deserved to win AFC POTW honors for Week 1.     "", ""Derek Carr's cold weather stats: How effective is the Raiders QB in subzero temperatures?  In last week's 13-10 defeat to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Las Vegas Raiders veteran quarterback Derek Carr tossed three interceptions and only completed 53% of his throws. The nine-year quarterback is renowned for being flustered by the game's emphasis on the chilly weather factor.  The idea that Carr performs poorly in games played in freezing conditions has some genuine merit. All of his exploits support this, but the Raiders as a whole do have problems when playing in cold weather conditions.        Bleacher Report@BleacherReportDEREK CARR WITH HIS 3RD INT OF THE NIGHT (via @NFL)4031321           Luckily for Derek Carr and the Las Vegas Raiders, their game against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 17 will take place in their climate-controlled Allegiant Stadium. Since being selected in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft, Derek Carr has been the team's starting quarterback and has played in seven games in which the temperature was 36 degrees or lower. He has a 0-7 record in these games. He has never scored more than one touchdown or helped his team score more than 19 points in a single game. The Raiders have yet to score more than 17 points in any of those seven games.     It may occasionally be less challenging for players to play outside in the cold. Similar to how it is in the muck and the rain. But things change when you add cold weather‚Äîlike how frigid it was in Week 17‚Äîand gusting winds that reach almost 50 mph. David Willsey@willson8torAll the good Adams and Jacob's did this year only to get cold weather Derek Carr'd and those championship dreams are gone4 In his seven games played in temperatures below 37 degrees, Derek Carr has only ever tossed one touchdown in each on average, and he has passed for 222 yards only once.     The Raiders and Steelers attacks both labored in Week 16 due to the chilly weather, and this presented the makings of a genuine primetime ice bowl. Both teams' performances were obviously impacted by the cold conditions, which felt like -4 degrees Fahrenheit. Will Derek Carr start in Week 17? In nine years, Derek Carr has sat out just three games‚Äîall due to injuries. For the rest of the campaign, the Las Vegas Raiders will start Jarrett Stidham at quarterback instead of nine-year pro Derek Carr, head coach Josh McDaniels announced on Wednesday. Speak@SpeakOnFS1.@JoyTaylorTalks reacts to the Raiders benching Derek Carr‚ÄúGet up out of there...

In the final two matches, Jarrett Stidham will be backed up by Chase Garbers.In the last four games, Carr has not completed more than 55% of his throws, and during that time, the quarterback has tossed seven interceptions and six touchdown passes.     "", 'Is Zach Wilson the new Paxton Lynch? NFL Pro Day performance shows similarities  New York Jets quarterback Zach Wilson put on a show on his NFL Pro Day before the 2021 NFL Draft and it raised his draft stock quite significantly. It culminated in him being drafted with the second overall pick, but the former BYU quarterback has yet to live up to the hype.  Another player who looked extremely good on his Pro Day many years ago was former Denver Broncos first-round pick Paxton Lynch. He was the 26th overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft and while he looked great on his pro day, his football career has been a total disaster.                     Both Wilson and Lynch surprised many with incredible throws and athleticism in their Pro Days, which attracted NFL teams\' interest but they failed to play well when called upon. Lynch played just two seasons in the NFL for the Denver Broncos and hasn\'t been in the league since then. In those two seasons, Lynch played in five games, throwing for 792 yards with four touchdowns and four interceptions.

A few days ago, Paxton Lynch became the first quarterback in the history of football to be benched in the NFL, USFL, CFL, and the XFL after he got benched by the Orlando Guardians against the Houston Roughnecks. Wilson was also benched by Mike White last season and is unlikely to start next season as well. The Jets QB wouldn\'t want to have the same career as Lynch, but if he doesn\'t improve quickly, things might get ugly.  New York Jets are not losing hope in Zach Wilson Zach Wilson: Detroit Lions v New York Jets     Although Zach Wilson has been pretty disappointing for the New York Jets, the franchise is still not losing hope in him. They are expected to bring in a veteran quarterback for next season, but they want Wilson to develop under him. B/R Gridiron@brgridironJets have big hopes for Derek Carr, via @diannaESPN5606239 The Jets are likely to land either Aaron Rodgers or Derek Carr, both of whom will make the team a dark horse contender next season, and will help their former second-overall pick as well.Wilson has faced a lot of scrutiny in just two seasons in New York and while many have lost faith in him, the franchise has hope that he will eventually come good.

What better way to do that than win against a vulnerable 5-2 Browns team that hasn't been consistent lately? Carr should be able to light the secondary on fire, as the Browns' secondary allowed Bengals rookie QB Joe Burrow to throw for 406 yards and 3 touchdowns.     Assuming the Browns are completely healthy on Sunday, Baker will have his supporting cast (minus Beckham) offensively.

They throw the ball a lot different. Derek\'s gonna fire it in there, and you gonna know that thing\'s coming quick. Aaron\'s got the ability to tighten that core up and flick that ball to you. So, the release is a lot different, but being able to get the ball to you late, if they see you coming out of a break, not many quarterbacks can get it to you before you get to the sideline if you\'re outside the numbers already.‚Äù        Around The NFL@AroundTheNFLDavante Adams compares Derek Carr to Aaron Rodgers: ""As far as talent and ability, it\'s really similar, if I\'m keeping it real."" nfl.com/news/raiders-w‚Ä¶101784           Adams concluded his point by saying that both quarterbacks understand the game and obsess over it: ‚ÄúHaving two guys like that with really strong arms, and understand the game, the mental part of it, is another similarity that they have.

Steve Young, Alex Smith and Brett Favre  Steve Young was once traded, Brett Favre was once traded, and now Russell Wilson has been traded. It can happen to even the most prestigious of names in the NFL. The movement of franchise signal-callers is nothing new.  Yet, it doesn't always work out, with several teams who traded away their star quarterback living to regret it reasonably soon after.        The Seattle Seahawks will be hoping they don't feel the same when a future analysis is made of the Wilson trade, but it is fascinating to see just how many times NFL teams simply get it completely wrong.

Hopes were high for Young, who excelled with the Los Angeles Express of the USFL, but his time in Tampa was ridiculed as he won just three of his 19 starts. Tampa ran out of patience with Young, especially as the prospect of drafting Vinny Testaverde with the No.1 overall pick in 1987 came up. Young, thus, was dealt to the San Francisco 49ers where Bill Walsh had seen something in the signal-caller and wanted him to succeed Joe Montana. Everyone wins‚Ä¶ right? Wrong. Testaverde went on to have an awful time in Tampa, registering a lowly 47.6 pass completion rate in his second year with the franchise and winning just five of his first 14 NFL games. In his six years as a Buccaneer, Testaverde never won more than six games in a season, and it's worth noting that the Tampa franchise wouldn't register a winning season from the date of the young trade right through to 1997.     On the other hand, Young had a glorious career in San Francisco, becoming one of the true greats of the modern era in the NFL. San Francisco 49ers@49ersOTD Steve Young breaks Joe Montana's Super Bowl record by throwing for SIX(!!!) touchdown passes. (via @NFLThrowback)5:42 PM ¬∑ Jan 29, 20212783427 As a starting quarterback, he went 91-33, won a Super Bowl and two MVP awards, proving the Buccaneers made a massive mistake in letting him go. He was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame in 2005, by which time the Bucs had registered just five winning seasons in 18 years since the deal.     #2 - San Francisco 49ers (Alex Smith to Kansas City Chiefs, 2013) New York Giants v San Francisco 49ers San Francisco don't always get things so spectacularly right, though, as proven by their 2013 decision to move Alex Smith to Kansas City. Despite his excessive talent, Smith's injury saw his position usurped by Colin Kaepernick as the starter in San Francisco. With Kaepernick leading the Niners to a Super Bowl, Smith was sent away to work with Andy Reid and the Chiefs. This seemed like the right move on paper at the time, yet Kaepernick's career in the NFL would spiral right out of control, albeit not for reasons entirely linked to on-field performance.     Meanwhile, Smith rejuvenated his career and became a prodigious passer in Reid's offense, throwing for 17,608 yards and 102 touchdowns in five years at Arrowhead Stadium. Kaepernick would lose his job as a starter by 2015 and only had one winning season after the Smith trade. Smith would not register anything other than winning records in all the NFL seasons he played for the Chiefs.

Jerry Glanville, the Falcons coach at the time, simply didn't want Favre. He didn't recognize his skillset, arm strength, or potential. He rather publicly thought spending a second-round pick on the future Hall of Famer was a waste of a pick. Jeff Pearlman@jeffpearlmanCan't overstate how big of a jerk Jerry Glanville was to rookie Brett Favre in Atlanta ...06:05 AM ¬∑ Dec 25, 201610148 He barely played and threw just four professional passes in his rookie year, completing zero. There were concerns about his off-field activities in Atlanta, and the situation was troubling, although the franchise simply gave up too quickly.     He was traded to the Green Bay Packers after one NFL season, and he would become an elite performer virtually from his first start. In the 16 seasons, he spent in Wisconsin, Favre would miss just one regular-season game, have just one losing season, win three successive MVP awards between 1995 and 1997 and win a Super Bowl. The Falcons would fire Jerry Glanville after the 1993 season, and he would never work in the NFL again, and the Georgia franchise would have one winning season from 1992 to 1997, during which Favre thrived. #4 - Miami Dolphins (Joe Theismann to Washington, 1974) Joe Theismann was a massive success in Washington     Miami has a somewhat troubled relationship with starting quarterbacks, and they were burned by their decision to offload Joe Theismann before he ever played a game for them. Miami drafted Theismann in the fourth round of the 1971 NFL Draft, but negotiations over a contract failed, and he chose to head to Canada, signing for the Toronto Argonauts. As was the system at the time, Theismann could do what he pleased in his career, but if he should ever decide to return to the NFL, it would be the Dolphins who owned his rights. Theismann excelled in Canada, while the Dolphins continued to succeed, reaching three successive Super Bowls and winning two. In 1974 the Dolphins cut ties with Theismann, agreeing to trade his rights to Washington, with the quarterback signing immediately. It took Theismann four years in Washington to become the team's starter, but then he began to shine. In 1982 he was established as one of the best passers in football and helped steer the Washington team to a Super Bowl victory before winning the MVP award for the 1983 season.     He threw for 25,206 yards over a 12-year career and had the team's record for most career wins, most career passing yards, most career completions, and most passes attempted. Perhaps regret is not the most appropriate word regarding the Dolphins here. The team continued to achieve winning seasons and would eventually draft Dan Marino in 1983, but letting a player go who would on to define another franchise can rarely be viewed as anything other than a lapse in judgment. #5 - Miami Dolphins (Ryan Tannehill to Tennessee Titans, 2019) Ryan Tannehill during his Dolphins career     Players seem to improve after leaving the Miami Dolphins, and there has been no better example than Ryan Tannehill, who was traded to the Tennessee Titans in 2019. In the three years since Tannehill was forced out of Miami, the Dolphins have struggled to find a successor at the quarterback position, while Tannehill has shone with the Titans. In the three seasons since the trade, the Dolphins have had a reasonable roster, achieving winning records in two of Brian Flores' three seasons. However, the lack of competency at the quarterback position has hamstrung the team. Ironically, with Tannehill having won the Comeback Player of the Year in 2019, thrown for over 10,000 yards, and won two playoff games, he is exactly the player who could have tipped the Dolphins over the line. 2019 saw him record the highest ever passer rating in Titans franchise history and the highest completion rate in a single season. Tannehill is looking towards his fourth season in Tennessee and is a candidate to reach the AFC Championship game. The Dolphins wish they had him throwing passes to newly signed receiver Tyreek Hill.

The Chiefs just announced that Lil Jon will perform during halftime to entertain fans.  However, Lil Jon performing at Arrowhead Stadium could be a very bad thing for the Jaguars. The last time Jon performed during halftime of a Chiefs game was back in 2016.        Kansas City Chiefs@ChiefsSpoiler alert: this halftime show is going to be fun @LilJon | @SkamArtist2585223           The Kansas City Chiefs went on to win that game 30-0 on the road against a Houston Texans team that won the AFC South that season. Alex Smith was the quarterback for KC back then, and he had a great game. Since then, the Chiefs have become a juggernaut, with Patrick Mahomes taking over as starting quarterback. It is definitely going to be a very tough game for Trevor Lawrence and company. Moreover, Lil Jon performing at halftime of the NFL Divisional Round game will excite the fans further, and they will be in full flow during the second half to support the home team. Trevor Lawrence has already fueled the fire within the Chiefs fans with his comments about the loudness in the stadium, and it could turn out to be a very long night for him.         Trevor Lawrence could make a statement in this NFL Divisional round game Trevor Lawrence: AFC Wild Card Playoffs - Los Angeles Chargers v Jacksonville Jaguars     Trevor Lawrence faced a lot of criticism after a poor start to his NFL career, but he bounced back well in his sophomore season with Doug Pederson. The Jaguars won the AFC South and shocked the Los Angeles Chargers in the Wild Card game. If Lawrence and the Jaguars are able to cause an upset over the Chiefs in the NFL Divisional Round, it will send shockwaves around the league. John Ewing ü¶Å@johnewingTrevor Lawrence has never lost a game in NFL, college or high school on a Saturday per @EvanHAbrams.2-0 NFL32-0 CFB3-0 HS@Jaguars +8.5 at Chiefs. Streak ends this Saturday. Let's go Chiefs!26127 The Jaguars are a +8.5 point underdog in this game against the Chiefs, and a herculean effort will be required from the whole team to get a win. Although Lawrence is confident about his team's chances, playing at Arrowhead Stadium in the playoffs is always tough.     So far this season, Lawrence has thrown for 4,113 yards, 25 touchdowns, and eight interceptions in 17 games. In the Wild Card game against the Chargers, Lawrence started the game with four interceptions in the first half but ultimately led his team to a win.He finished his first playoff game in the NFL completing 28 passes in 47 attempts for 288 yards with four touchdowns and four interceptions. It will be fascinating to see how he will fare against the Chiefs in the NFL Divisional round.     "", ""Just how good was Patrick Mahomes in his rookie year? Could Chiefs‚Äô rivals have seen his greatness coming?  Patrick Mahomes is having a great season with the Kansas City Chiefs. He has led them to a 9-2 record that sees them atop the AFC standings. He has thrown for 3,585 yards, which sees him averaging 325.9 yards per game and has accumulated 29 touchdowns. He is in line to have his best season since 2018 when he won the MVP award in the first season as a starter.  Of course, he also won Super Bowl LIV in the 2019 season and was the Super Bowl MVP in that game as well. He reached the Super Bowl again in the 2020 season. At this point, there is no doubt that he has already established himself in his young career as one of the greatest quarterbacks to have played the game.        It points to a degree of sustained success and one that was visible right from the off. He was taken in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs and there were high hopes from him. He came into the NFL having won the Sammy Baugh Trophy in 2016.           Even then, in the rookie season he sat behind starter Alex Smith and learned from him. He only started one regular-season game in his debut campaign, after the Chiefs had already booked their place in the playoffs. He completed 22 of his 35 attempts for 284 yards. But it was marred by the one interception he threw and failing to throw a touchdown pass. It is tough for any backup to come into this situation and a better judgment of his caliber could be found in the preseason games that he played. His performances during those four preseason games predicted his exceptional potential.     Patrick Mahomes' rookie 2017 season: performances in preseason games The Kansas City Chiefs played four preseason games in the 2017 season. Patrick Mahomes features in all of them. In Week 1, they played the San Francisco 49ers and the fans and Chiefs' rivals got to see him for the first time. He was not prominent in that game but he made the best use of the time he had on the field. He completed seven of his nine passes and had a touchdown. In Week 2, the Chiefs played the Cincinnati Bengals. Patrick Mahomes again showed his mettle throwing for 88 passing yards. He completed 10 of his 14 throws and they were consequential in scoring two touchdowns. He also showed his ability in rushing with 29 rushing yards, proving to his leagues that he could always outscamper them, if needed. Week 3 against the Seattle Seahawks was a more sobering experience for him. Patrick Mahomes completed only eight of his 15 throws for just 70 passing yards. He had just two yards of rushing and did not throw or rush for a touchdown.     But Week 3 turned out to be an outlier as he was dialed in for Week 4 of the 2017 preseason against the Tennessee Titans. Patrick Mahomes completed nine of his 16 throws for 183 yards. He also had 13 yards rushing and led the team to one touchdown. The only negative was perhaps his fumble in the game. The game is also noted for a ridiculous pass he made while getting hit and off-balance that showed just how good he could be. Tone Digs@ToneDigzThe Patrick Mahomes 2017 preseason throw that put everyone on notice.2309     He was the best quarterback during the preseason of his rookie year. He was sacked on just eight percent of his dropbacks despite facing a 41 percent pressure rate. He had a completion percentage of 67.9 and his 109.2 passer rating was the best in the league. Warren Sharp@SharpFootballTHIS IS INSANE  These are Patrick Mahomes 2017 preseason highlights.After only a couple months of practice.He was only 21! 21 year olds aren‚Äôt supposed to do this in the NFL.He didn‚Äôt even start this season.Mahomes was a legend since DAY ONE1262145Patrick Mahomes had served notice to the rest of the league that he was here to stay. In the 2018 campaign, he got his chance as a starter. He has not looked back since.     "", ""NFL 2018: Ranking the new QB situations for 2018 season  The 2018 off-season began even before the Super Bowl 52 was played. The Washington Redskins agreed to trade for quarterback Alex Smith from the Kansas City Chiefs in late January thus resetting the QB market even before the season ended. Two teams already had two new quarterbacks before the Eagles could beat out the defending champions in February.  The trade freed the embattled ex-Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins to sign with the Minnesota Vikings in Free agency. The Vikings, who made it to the NFC Championship game, had three starting-caliber quarterbacks and let them all hit the free agency and signed Cousins to a first-ever full guaranteed contract.        Weeks prior to the start of free agency it was obvious that the Cousins-Vikings marriage is inevitable, which prompted the MVP of Vikings season Case Keenum to struck a deal with Denver Broncos even before the Cousins deal was finalized. This Keenum deal started the domino effect with many teams that are in the QB market started making deals.           Cleveland Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor from the Buffalo Bills, one of many trades they made this offseason. Arizona Cardinals signed Sam Bradford, New York Jets Signed Teddy Bridgewater and then traded him to the New Orleans Saints after an amazing preseason. AJ McCarron signed with the Bills and got beat out by rookie Josh Allen to become the starter which prompted the Bills to trade him to Oakland. Speaking of rookies, the 2018 draft had as many as Five QBs taken in round 1. By Week 4, four of the 5 are starting and the fifth QB is already seeing some game action in trick plays.     Including both the Veterans and Rookies, there are as many as Eight teams who had new Quarterbacks starting for them this year. Let's take a look at how these QBs fared so far with their new teams. Let's start with a Bonus player, the man who took the league by surprise and then crash landed in week 4:  BONUS: Ryan Fitzpatrick (2-2)  Oh, where to start. When I first started to think about this article after week 2, I had him competing for the number 1 spot with the current number 1 and then week 4 happened and the head coach Dirk Koetter has announced that Jameis Winston will be starting after the week 5 bye.     Since, FitzMagic is just a placeholder for Winston, who was serving his 3-game suspension, I decided not to include him in the rankings but thought he deserved a shout-out for his performance through the first three weeks. He went 2-2 in his starts when no one expected him to be anything better than 1-3. He faced three playoff teams from last year and went 2-1 in those games and came close to being 3-0 while trying to make an epic comeback against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 3. He posted 400 yards in each of his first three games, an NFL record. But week 4 proved why Fitzpatrick is who he is, a journeyman quarterback. The four-game stretch should help him get more money in the next offseason and will be a highly paid backup QB. #8 Josh Rosen/Sam Bradford, Arizona Cardinals (0-4)      Two teams have already started two quarterbacks who were not on their roster last season, one of them is Arizona Cardinals. Cardinals, who saw both their quarterback and head coach retire after last season had a complete overhaul in coaching and QB room. The added three quarterbacks including Mike Glennon. Sam Bradford, who is coming off injuries, signed a 1 year 20 million dollar contract and became a presumed starter. But, the Cardinals are off to a terrible start losing out in all the three starts prompting the change to go with the rookie Josh Rosen. Bradford in his three starts completed 62.5% of his passes for 400 yards and two touchdowns. But, he also had four INTs to his name. Bradford, couldn't move the ball well under Mike McCoy's game plan. He struggled in the first 2 games where the offense only scored 6 points in total. He started off well in the Week 3 matchup against the Chicago Bears where he tossed two TDs to start the game, but then couldn't find the momentum in the rest of the game which paved the way for the rookies Josh Rosen to come in the fourth quarter and try to win the game which was a very close contest.         Rosen was named starter for week 4 and quietly had an impressive debut. Rosen probably threw for only 180 yards but kept the Cardinals in the game without making any stupid mistakes. Cardinals eventually lost to the Russell Wilson's Seahawks, but had a glimpse of their bright future. The Cardinals running game needs to be picked up. The O-line has been one of the worst in the league, which handcuffed one of the elite tailbacks in David Johnson.     This Cardinals offense reminds me of 2016 Rams team which made Todd Gurley, Jared Goff and Case Keenum do nothing. This Cardinals offense is doing the same to David Johnson, Josh Rosen and Larry Fitzerald. Look for a coaching change to come this off season even though it is the first season as a head coach for Steve Wilks, at the very least the OC needs to be changed. With the correct play caller, this offense is capable of some high flying action ala Chiefs, Rams and the Texans. #7 Josh Allen/Nathan Peterman, Buffalo Bills (1-3)      Buffalo Bills had one of the strangest QB competition in NFL this offseason. They had three quarterbacks in the battle for the starting spot during the training camp. All thought that it would be AJ McCarron but instead as the preseason approached McCarron became third stringer and expendable, thus his trade to Raiders. The Bill surprisingly announced Nathan Peterman over the rookie Josh Allen as the starter for week 1, but Peterman repeated his first start performance from last year when he threw for 5 picks. He threw 2 picks and scored nothing, which led for the rookie Josh Allen to take the reigns. Allen in his three starts the next three weeks, completed only 53.4% of passes throwing just two touchdowns with four picks. His best game came in week 3 when the Buffalo Bills stunned the world by beating the Minnesota Vikings. Allen had three total TDs, 2 of them coming on the ground, showing off his athleticism in that game. But, he came back to earth in week 4, throwing 2 picks against an average Packers defense.     Allen, as expected, is raw and playing like a typical rookie. In an ideal scenario, he could use a redshirt season before taking over the reigns like Patrick Mahomes, but he did not have the luxury of learning under someone like Alex Smith, instead, the situation has thrust him into starting role early. He is going to have some growing pains but if week 3 is any indication he is going to be big in long term. #6 Baker Mayfield/Tyrod Taylor, Cleveland Browns (1-2-1)      This is the second team in the list that already had two starters who were not on the roster last season. The Browns traded for Tyrod Taylor during the offseason. A month later the Browns picked Baker Mayfield with the number 1 overall pick. Mayfield was supposed to be redshirted this season with Taylor holding the place for the year at least until the Browns are out of Playoff contention. But with Taylor's concussion in Week 3 Thursday Night matchup against the Jets, Mayfield came in late second quarter and helped Browns mount the comeback and give the franchise its first win in 17 games. Browns had a great start to the season, mostly thanks to the defense which stifled Ben Roethlisberger in Week 1. Drew Brees also had a tough time playing against this defense. Browns started 0-1-1 in the first two weeks and entered week 3 as favorites for the first time in almost two seasons.     Tyrod Taylor apart from a couple of plays had a tough start to his Browns tenure. That bad form continued in week 3. The first half of that game was unwatchable with Tyrod under center. But, when Mayfield came into the game, the dynamics changed. Browns offense is fun to watch after a very long time, He made the plays that Tyrod Taylor would hesitate to do.     Mayfield brought the life back into the Browns fans. The stadium was lit during the Second Half. That Second Half started a new era in Cleveland Football History. Mayfield was named a starter for Week 4 and beyond as expected. On his first start though Mayfield came back to earth against the Oakland Raiders.     Mayfield threw for two touchdowns but also had four turnovers which resulted in 21 Raiders points. Mayfield showed off his athletic skills, but also showed it was premature to make him a HOF player after that amazing second half in week 3. It is going to be interesting to see how the Browns and Mayfield will continue the rest of the way in all of a sudden new look AFC North that has Steelers tied at the bottom of the table instead of the top. #5 Sam Darnold, New York Jets (1-3)      Darnold was the only rookie quarterback who was named the starting quarterback prior to week 1. He had to earn the job in a battle with Teddy Bridgewater. Both Darnold and Bridgewater had a good preseason leading the Jets to trade Bridgewater to Saints and announce Darnold as a starter. Unlike other rookies, Darnold had an impressive start to his career. He completed 76% of his passes for 198 yards, 2 TDs and a pick with an impressive 116.8 rating. But after that, he came back crashing to earth. He had 4 more INTs to only 2 TDs in the remaining three games.         Darnold had his first career game without any interception in week 4 against a very good Jacksonville Jaguars defense. That should be considered a minor victory for a rookie QB who is struggling after a strong start. Unlike other quarterbacks, Darnold isn't surrounded by high flying talent. His receivers and the running backs are well below league average. In order to succeed long-term, the Jets need to provide weapons around him as the Bears did with Mitchell Trubisky this year, which helped him go off in week 4. Quincy Enunwa and the receivers need to step up and help the rookie QB to have any shot this year. Patriots, who had a slow start are getting back their groove right in time with Julian Edelman returning from his suspension. Jets will be facing a tough Denver defense in week 5. if Darnold could escape that game without a Turnover, they could have a very good chance to escape with a W. He could take some pointer from his veteran backup and mentor Josh McCown.     #4 Alex Smith, Washington Redskins (2-1)  Alex Smith has been his typical self to start the 2018 season with his new team the Washington Redskins. He has a completed nearly 70% of his passes and scored 4 Touchdowns with a pick and a 2-1 record. That is a typical Alex Smith stat line. Smith had a good start for his redskins tenure against the Cardinals, where he threw for 255 yards and a couple of TDs. But, in week 2 against a mediocre Colts defense Smith couldn't find the endzone even though completing nearly 72% of his passes. He and the Redskins bounced back in week 3 against the Packers where he outplayed Rodgers to upset the Packers.     Smith success correlates with the success of the running game. in the two wins, the Redskins new running back, Adrian Peterson rushed for nearly hundred yards and has scored a TD at least once, in the loss against the Colts he rushed 11 times for just 20 yards. Smith is one of those QBs who needs all the dominoes around him should work efficiently to find the success. He does not commit any back-breaking mistakes but he does not even get you out of the gate if fallen behind. NFC East is vulnerable right now and Redskins sit on top of the division even with their bye on week 4. The one difference between the Chiefs and the Redskins is that they lack that dynamic pass catcher that could help a QB out. Jordan Reed had some success in the wins but Jamison Crowder has yet to find the rhythm. It will be interesting to see if Smith can help out the Redskins to remain on top of a very close NFC East race as he did with the Chiefs the past few Seasons.     #3 Case Keenum, Denver Broncos (2-2)  Case Keenum, an undrafted free agent out of the University of Houston, had one of the most unprecedented journeys to become the starting quarterback of Denver Broncos. After his amazing career year in 2017 with the Vikings, Keenum signed a 2 year 36 million dollar contract with the Broncos. But, so far Keenum was not able to replicate the kind of success he had last season. Keenum had a total of 7 INTs in 2017 season has already thrown for 6 so far in four games and just tossing three touchdowns. Keenum's decision making at times seem erratic. He is trying to do more than what the defenses are giving him.     Even with his erratic play Keenum found some early success in the first two weeks by having two clutch game winning drives, which Broncos did not have last season. He almost had a third game winning drive on the MNF, week 4 against the Chiefs. He overthrew a wide open Demaryius Thomas which could have resulted in a game winning TD. In the next play he did connect to the rookie Courtland Sutton in an old-school hook and ladder play call.         Keenum, just like Smith is a game manager who needs to have a better player all around him. He has a solid running game with the two rookies, Royce Freeman and Phillip Lindsay sharing the work load, but the receivers apart from Emmanuel Sanders haven't really stepped up. The reason for having Keenum just a tick above the Last year with Vikings Keenum had Thielen and Diggs who had some amazing catches that helped out Keenum. Keenum knows that Demaryius Thomas is no longer in that elite group and need to be more careful forcing the ball into the tight coverage. The reason I have Keenum a tick above Alex Smith is that of his Clutch performance in weeks 1 and 2 and his NFC Championship game appearance just a few months back. I still think that Keenum is an upgrade to what Denver had last season and could help them have a fighting chance to at least grab the Wildcard spot in the playoffs.     There is no panic yet in Denver, there is a lot of season left and with no viable back up option left this will be Keenum's Season. If he can clean up the turnovers, this Denver team could be in hunt for a playoff spot in December. #2 Kirk Cousins, Minnesota Vikings (1-2-1)  Kirk Cousins, signed a monster contract with the Minnesota Vikings this offseason. After reaching the NFC Championship game a year ago with Keenum under center, the expectations very sky high for the Vikings fans. Some even considered this a Superbowl or bust move.     If indeed it is a Superbowl or bust move, the Vikings are off to a terrible start. They opened the season with a W against the 49ers but tied it up in week 2 with the Packers thanks to some head-scratching roughing the passer penalties. But the real stunner cam in Week 3 when Vikings and Cousins looked almost clueless against a bad Buffalo Bills team who scored a combined 23 points in the remaining three games. Cousins was shutout for three quarters, he had a couple of strip sacks an INT and it was late in the 4Q that he tossed a TD almost in garbage time. Apart from that one week, Cousins was his usual self he completed nearly 70% of his passes, tossing 10 Touchdowns and just 2 picks. He has 1,387 yards in just 4 games and yet the record is 1-2-1 record.         Cousins tenure so far remained same like his Redskins tenure where he played very well when was not pressured too much. But, when pressured his performance goes down. In 2018 so far his rating when the pocket is clean was 112.2, but when he is pressured it dramatically drops down to 89.8. Cousins even brought his fumbling issue from Redskins to Vikings, in which he is second most to fumble the ball since 2015. The Vikings O-line performance has been masked by Keenum's athleticism last season of avoiding the sacks, which Cousins clearly lacks. If Vikings need to find success with Cousins under center they need to provide a clean pocket and give him time to make the plays that Keenum couldn't have done last season. The NFC North looks very interesting with Chicago Bears on Top with Packer right next to them. If the Vikings need to be in the Playoffs in a very tough NFC they need to keep teh pocket clean for Cousins.     #1 Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs (4-0)  Patrick Mahomes is not a new player that was signed or added this offseason but he is the new starter for the Kansas City Chiefs after they traded Alex Smith to the Redskins. Mahomes did start in week 17 of last season but still, this is the first season as a full-fledged starter and thought he should be in this conversation. After the kind of start he had, he certainly should be.     Mahomes had one of the best starts since the Peyton Manning's record-breaking 2013 season. Mahomes even broke the Manning's record of 12 total touchdowns by tossing 13 through weeks 1-3. During the first three weeks, Mahomes was off to fast starts putting up 20+ points to start the game and make the opposing offenses play catchup to the Chiefs. The real test for Mahomes came in week 4 against a very good Broncos defense in a very rowdy Denver environment in Monday Night Prime-time slot. He had a slow start where Denver's defense had his number during the first three quarters. But he remained calm and made some timely passes in the fourth quarter resulting in one of the most thrilling matches in 2018 season so far.         The most amazing fact about Mahomes' performance so far in 2018 is that he has yet to throw an interception. In his four starts this season he has 15 touchdowns and zero picks. This INT-less streak should be attributed to his redshirt year in 2017 under Alex Smith. There is no better player to learn from how to remain interception-free. Mahomes performance so far is a reminiscence of Deshaun Watson's performance for Houston Texans last season. Mahomes is bound to be regressed in coming weeks, which could happen very well in week 5 against a very strong Jaguars defense, who allowed only a total of 4 touchdowns. The sky is the limit for Mahomes and this Kansas City offense. All they could ask for is the defense to play some average level play who currently are last in passing yards allowed. If the defense is not improved, a very good offensive season could very well be ruined come January. Mahomes, distanced himself from others atop of the MVP race, not a bad way to kickoff your first full season as a starting NFL QB.

Players like Robert Griffin III, Russell Wilson, and Justin Herbert all had outstanding seasons immediately after entering the league.  Unfortunately this isn‚Äôt the case for every quarterback entering NFL. Some players take longer to adapt to the increased competition once they reach the pros, before going on to have Hall of Fame careers. However, some quarterbacks have had terrible rookie campaigns and never truly recovered.        Here are five of the worst rookie quarterback seasons in NFL history.            #5 - Terry Bradshaw Terry Bradshaw with the Pittsburgh Steelers Terry Bradshaw was selected first overall by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 1970 NFL Draft out of Louisiana Tech. That was after the Steelers won a coin flip for the first pick against the Chicago Bears, as both teams had a 1-13 record the previous season. Bradshaw split time during his rookie season with the team\'s starter at the time, Terry Hanratty. Bradshaw featured in 13 games, starting right during his rookie campaign, but his stat line left a lot to be desired. He threw just six touchdowns against a massive 24 interceptions and went 3-5 as the starter.     Bradshaw would of course become one of the best quarterbacks of his generation. He won four Super Bowls for the Steelers, as well as making three Pro Bowls, and getting an NFL MVP award in 1978. He was also voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989, something that looked very unlikely after his shaky start in the league.  #4 - Alex Smith Alex Smith Alex Smith, like Bradshaw, was selected first overall, in his case, in the 2005 NFL Draft. This draft went down in league history as we saw Aaron Rodgers sit for hours in the green room before he was selected by the Green Bay Packers 24th overall.     Coming out of Utah, many fans and analysts alike had Smith down as a bust. In the seven games he started in 2005, he only threw one touchdown against 11 interceptions and only won two games. Smith also only amassed a passer rating of 40.8, averaging fewer than 100 passing yards per game. Despite the dismal rookie year, Smith recovered and played his best football for the Kansas City Chiefs, where he made three Pro Bowls, leading the league in passing in 2017. After mentoring Patrick Mahomes to take the starting role in Kansas City, Smith suffered a horrendous leg injury while with the Washington Redskins, which almost required amputation. Smith recovered, however, and even returned to the gridiron, as he was named NFL Comeback Player of the Year in 2020.  #3 - Eli Manning Eli Manning overcame his disappointing rookie season     One of the most controversial moments in draft history was when Eli Manning refused to play for the San Diego Chargers, instead opting for the New York Giants. The Giants might have been regretting that move following Manning‚Äôs rookie year. After spending time sitting behind starter Kurt Warner throughout the year, Manning was limited to just seven starts. He didn‚Äôt get a win until the final game of the year against the Dallas Cowboys. Manning only managed to throw for 1,043 yards total, as well as tossing just six touchdowns against nine interceptions. In addition, he only amassed a passer rating of 55.4, easily the lowest total of his career. Manning, of course, recovered from this rocky start, leading the Giants to two Super Bowl titles over Tom Brady and the New England Patriots, winning Super Bowl MVPs in both games. He was also voted to four Pro Bowls, and retired in 2020 holding virtually all passing records in New York Giants franchise history.     NFL UK@NFLUK""For me, it\'s only a Giant"".Eli Manning\'s retirement speech.You\'ll be missed on the field, Eli.@giants .1025  #2 - John Elway John Elway of the Denver Broncos     Like many of the other quarterbacks on this list, John Elway was the consensus number one overall pick when the Denver Broncos took him in the 1983 NFL Draft. However, like the other signal-callers on this list, he had a disastrous rookie season. Elway began as the starter for Denver in each of his first two games. But after struggling, he was relieved by veteran Steve DeBerg in both outings where the Broncos won both games. Elway‚Äôs rookie campaign was tarnished with inconsistency, both from his play and his availability, as he was in and out of the lineup due to poor play and injuries. He ended his debut season with just seven touchdowns to 14 interceptions and only won four of the 10 games started. Elway would bounce back, however, as the Pro Football Hall of Famer was voted to nine Pro Bowls, winning league MVP in 1987. He led Denver to back-to-back Super Bowl titles in 1997 and 1998 before immediately retiring from the NFL.      #1 - Ryan Leaf Ryan Leaf of the San Diego Chargers Undoubtedly, the worst rookie campaign for a quarterback in NFL history goes to former San Diego Chargers signal-caller Ryan Leaf. The team had selected him second overall in the 1998 NFL Draft, a pick after the Indianapolis Colts selected Peyton Manning. It was clear Leaf was a bust from his rookie year, as his debut campaign was blighted by poor play and behavior. He missed the final day of a mandatory symposium for all NFL draftees, which led to a $10,000 fine.      He was also seen to have a terrible work ethic, with former teammates Rodney Harrison and Junior Seau criticizing him, saying Leaf was working on his golf rather than studying tape. Leaf ended his rookie year with a terrible stat line - two touchdowns against 15 interceptions and a dismal passer rating of just 39.0. It is no wonder that with this terrible play and work ethic, Leaf would be out of the league by the age of 26. An NFL Top 10 episode ranked him as the biggest bust in league history.

Prior to his NFL career, Mahomes shone at Texas Tech University. The Chiefs were so impressed by Mahomes in college that they traded up for him in the 2017 NFL Draft.           In three seasons at Texas Tech, Mahomes threw for 11,252 yards, 93 touchdowns, and 29 interceptions. The most memorable game of Mahomes\' college career was against Baker Mayfield\'s Oklahoma Sooners on October 22, 2016. The two quarterbacks shone in a game that made NCAA history. The two combined for 12 touchdown passes and 1,279 passing yards. Mahomes accounted for 734 passing yards and five touchdowns. He also led Texas Tech in rushing yards with 85 and two rushing touchdowns.        Mahomes completed 52 out of 88 passing attempts, while Mayfield completed 27 out of 36 passes.

60,Patrick Mahomes,"['Is Patrick Mahomes fully healthy? An update on the quarterback\'s ankle and recovery progress  Is Patrick Mahomes\' high ankle sprain a problem, given that the Super Bowl is only a day away and that he is probably the most crucial player for the Kansas City Chiefs? Undoubtedly.  Mahomes injured his ankle during the Chiefs\' Divisional Round game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was still able to drag them to the Super Bowl and has been using the days off to recover, though he is still far from fully fit.        He has been actively participating in practices this week while focusing on his recovery.           NFL Films@NFLFilmsTrue competitor @PatrickMahomes wasn\'t getting pulled from the game without a fight.1736208 According to Albert Breer, coach Andy Reid has said that he can\'t claim Patrick Mahomes is 100%. A high ankle sprain can take up to a month to heal, but the good news for the Chiefs is that Mahoes should be in better shape than he was in his previous outing against the Cincinnati Bengals. NFL Network@nflnetwork""He can really do just about everything, at least everything in the game plan.""Andy Reid gives an update on Patrick Mahomes\' ankle.16413     High ankle sprains are painful and can impair performance, but given Mahomes\' physical conditioning and the level of treatment teams can offer to athletes in their recovery, he should be healthy enough to last the entire game against the Eagles. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback suffered a similar injury in the past. Mahomes sustained a high ankle sprain on his left ankle in 2019. He did not sit out any games due to the ankle issue, although he did miss a few games due to a dislocated kneecap later that season. ""I can move around better than I did two weeks ago. We\'ll see how much closer to 100 percent I can be on game day, but I can definitely walk around better,"" Mahomes said. Matt McMullen@KCChiefs_Matt‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely in a better spot. I can move around better than I did two weeks ago‚Ä¶I‚Äôll be able to move around better for sure, and we‚Äôll see on game day how close to 100% I can be.‚Äù- Patrick Mahomes on his ankle29117 The Chiefs will be thrilled as long as he moves more fluidly than he did against the Cincinnati Bengals. Even though he was limited during the Chiefs\' 23-20 victory, he still managed to complete 29 of his 43 throws for 326 yards and two scores. Against a formidable Philadelphia Eagles defense, he will need to produce better numbers if the Chiefs are to secure their second Super Bowl title in five years.     ', ""Is Patrick Mahomes already a future NFL Hall of Famer? Chiefs QB's Super Bowl performance one for the ages  Patrick Mahomes did it again. This time, it was arguably his most impressive performance ever. The Kansas City Chiefs signal-caller finished Super Bowl LVII with an efficient line of 21/27 for 182 yards and three touchdowns. He also ran for 44 yards on an aggravated sprained ankle.  His injury may have completely neutralized other quarterbacks in the league, but with Mahomes, he played through it and looked just as good as he ever has. The win gives him his second Super Bowl title and his second MVP in the big game. Is he already a Hall of Fame lock?

He has all of this just six years into his career. It is fair to point out that he is playing for one of the greatest offensive minds in NFL history in Andy Reid. The head coach was scheming his players the entire game against the Philadelphia Eagles defense to an extent that it looked almost comical. If Mahomes decides to retire today, he will likely reach the Hall of Fame. But, of course, that is not happening. FOX Sports: NFL@NFLonFOXMahomes joins some ELITE company 2355552     Assumptions aside, it is now a fun game to begin projecting just how far Mahomes will go. How many Super Bowls will he win? Just a year ago, it seemed that Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals were the team to beat in the AFC. Then there was talk of the AFC West being the toughest division in all of football. So naturally, the Chiefs dominated once again all the way to a Super Bowl title.The living Chiefs legend is only 27 years old and just led a Super Bowl run with a bum ankle. Assuming he maintains his health, and Reid sticks around to call the shots, it will be hard to count the Chiefs out at any point in the near future.     "", 'Patrick Mahomes proves he‚Äôs all about business, ramps up 2023 preparations mere days after Super Bowl parade  Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes could be forgiven for wanting some time to rest and relax after a long and arduous NFL season. However, after winning his second Super Bowl just weeks ago, the quarterback has chosen a different path.  At this stage of the year, players are on holiday, enjoying time with their families and not worrying about football, but not Mahomes. The two-time NFL MVP is back at work already. In a Twitter post from Arrowhead Live, Mahomes could be seen putting in the work with Bobby Stroupe, a well-known Health, Performance & Player development consultant.        Arrowhead Live@ArrowheadLiveNot even 10 days removed from winning a SB and @PatrickMahomes is already back in the lab with @bobbystroupe\u200d#Chiefs | #ChiefsKingdom1804126           Seeing this, particularly at this time of year, will make Chiefs fans extremely happy. After winning his second Super Bowl, the quarterback could easily have taken a few weeks off to refresh his mind and body and then attack the offseason. Instead, it seems like there are no rest days for the quarterback. If he wants to be the best (some argue he is already), then he has to put the work in. Going by Stoupe\'s post, that is exactly what the quarterback is doing.      Patrick Mahomes eyeing third Super Bowl Kansas City Chiefs Victory Parade When former NFL quarterback Tom Brady was asked which Super Bowl win was his favorite, he replied, ""The next one"". It appears that Mahomes has a similar thought.        Not happy with ""just"" two (some players don\'t even make it to the Super Bowl, let alone win it), the Chiefs star clearly wants more. After Tyreek Hill was sent to the Miami Dolphins in the offseason, many thought the Chiefs\' offense would struggle. Well, they didn\'t and they ended up being champions.    While the roster will go through various changes over the next few months, the one constant is the quarterback. If this year\'s shown us anything, it\'s that Mahomes will be at the top of his game for the foreseeable future and that is scary.What is even scarier is that he has only been in the league for six years and has plenty of time to add to his already impressive list of accolades. He clearly covets winning another Super Bowl and the work to get back to the NFL\'s penultimate game is already underway.

NFL\'s drug policy garners attention as fake tweet goes viral  Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was caught in a storm when a tweet claiming he used PEDs during Sunday\'s Super Bowl victory went viral, which, as expected turned out to be false. The Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38‚Äì35 in Super Bowl LVII at the State Farm Stadium in Arizona, with the 27-year-old Chiefs quarterback taking home the Super Bowl MVP award.  After the Chiefs\' victory against the Eagles, however, a report about Mahomes testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) started to circulate.        The report turned out to be false, though. The rumor was started by the Simon Charles Twitter account. Charles claims to be a ""respected sports writer"" and uses a stock photo of an elderly man.           Simon Charles@S_CharlesNFL#BREAKING: Chiefs Super Bowl legitimacy put on hold as NFL plans to launch an investigation on possible PED use by Patrick Mahomes during halftime. Sources confirm his rapid postgame drug test came back POSITIVE and if guilty the Chiefs could be stripped of the win.114942070 However, the account is a parody, and by publishing such material, it has amassed a following of almost 4,000 individuals. According to the post, Patrick Mahomes\' quick post-game drug test returned a positive result, and if found guilty, the Chiefs might be stripped of the title.     The post, which received two million views at the time of writing, sparked rumors that Mahomes used performance-enhancing drugs. However, it has since been made clear that this was wrong information and nothing mentioned in the tweet was true. Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the NFL, deemed the assertion to be ""completely incorrect."" The performance-enhancing substance policy of the NFL and the NFL Players Association requires a random selection of five players from each team to undergo drug testing. One of the Chiefs players chosen to undergo testing wasn\'t Mahomes.  What is the NFL‚Äôs PED policy? The NFL\'s Performance Enhancing Drug policy forbids players from using anabolic, steroid, or exogenous testosterone. If players use online-purchased stimulants, growth hormones, or steroids, they are banned. snopes.com@snopesA screenshot of a tweet is going around on social media that claims Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs following the team\'s Super Bowl victory. The tweet came from an apparent satire account. snopes.com/fact-check/pat‚Ä¶93     The NFL believes that using performance-enhancing drugs endangers the fairness and integrity of the game while benefiting the users. Sanctions for using PEDs -The first infraction carries a four-to-six-game suspension. -A two-game punishment results from a player using an agent to conceal the usage of performance-enhancing substances. -Use of stimulants, HGH, or steroids results in a four-game penalty. -A six-game punishment is incurred when a test is tampered with. -A 10-game ban results after a second infraction. -A third offense can result in a season-long suspension or more.In general, suspensions do not apply during the offseason. When a player tests positive for drugs during the offseason, the NFL requires them to complete a substance abuse program.The PED policy does not apply to alcohol or marijuana. According to the NFL\'s recreational drug policy, marijuana positives no longer result in fines.     ', ""Way too early Super Bowl MVP prediction: Can anyone stop Patrick Mahomes?  This Super Bowl will likely be a tale of two quarterbacks: Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts. With respect to Hurts, Mahomes is the best quarterback in football. He's going to win another MVP after losing arguably the best wide receiver in football this season.   He carried the Kansas City Chiefs, on a hobbled ankle, through the playoffs and into the Super Bowl. The Philadelphia Eagles are a well-rounded team with a strong defense, but the Chiefs go as Mahomes goes.                       In terms of winning Super Bowl MVP, Mahomes is the most likely. He's been the best player all year long and he's going to be the best player on that field.  Will he be able to win MVP? If the Chiefs win, there's no doubt he takes home his second such award. The way they're set up, if they win it will be because of an incredible performance from Mahomes.  With no wide receivers, a non-existent run game, a middling defense and the Eagles having much better of all that and more, Mahomes will have to put on an all-time performance to get the win. If he doesn't, then the door is certainly open for others.       If not Patrick Mahomes, who can win Super Bowl MVP? The Eagles have probably the strongest defense in the postseason and certainly the strongest the Chiefs will have seen this playoffs.  Patrick Mahomes is the best of the best, but facing Darius Slay and James Bradberry with a ragtag bunch of injured pass catchers is going to be difficult.     That opens the door. If the Eagles' run all over Kansas City, then it can be expected that Hurts will be right in the middle of it and he'll win the award.      Don't count out one of their two elite wide receivers, either. Not many people can guard AJ Brown, so he could have a Cooper Kupp-esque game. Devonta Smith is no slouch either and won't draw the best coverage the Chiefs have to offer.  Can AJ Brown win MVP over Patrick Mahomes? Haason Reddick wreaked havoc on the San Francisco 49ers, so he's certainly capable of putting up a Super Bowl MVP-like performance on the defensive side. Patrick Mahomes is the favorite for good reason, but the Super Bowl MVP is almost always on the winning side. That opens the door for Hurts, Brown or even Miles Sanders to potentially take home the award.      "", 'Jason Kelce‚Äôs statement about Jalen Hurts‚Äô performance in SB loss to Patrick Mahomes leaves fans trolling Eagles star  Last season\'s Super Bowl between Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs and Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles was one for the ages. The Chiefs would come out on top 38-35 as Mahomes won his second ring.  But the performance of Eagles quarterback Hurts was something to behold, as aside from his costly fumble, Hurts was faultless on the biggest stage.        His center, Jason Kelce, recently stated that Hurts still beats himself up over it and that he told the 24-year-old that he had the best-ever performance by a quarterback in a Super Bowl. Fans saw this and trolled Kelce over his comments, with one fan saying that it wasn\'t an all-time great effort from Hurts.

Jalen Hurts and Eagles looking to go one better in 2023 Super Bowl LVII - Kansas City Chiefs v Philadelphia Eagles     Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles had a superb 2022 season and came extremely close to winning the Super Bowl earlier this year. But after such a close loss, one of two things usually happens to teams.    They either use it as motivation and get back to the big game or it takes a mental toll, and the following season is poor. It will be interesting to see which way it goes for the Eagles. The road back isn\'t exactly going to be easy. After losing a host of defensive starters plus their two coordinators, the Eagles and Jalen Hurts will have a tougher time next season.        Add in that the Dallas Cowboys have improved, so have Seattle, and then there are the San Francisco 49ers. So the Eagles ""should"" be making it to the playoffs, and once there, they can use last season\'s loss to push them to greater heights.The long road back to the Super Bowl starts at training camp in a few weeks, and the Eagles, along with Jalen Hurts, have their eyes focused squarely on winning that Super Bowl.     ', 'Patrick Mahomes left stunned as Julio Rodriguez puts on a show at MLB Home Run Derby 2023 - ""That was wild!!!""  Patrick Mahomes was electrified by Seattle Mariners outfielder Julio Rodriguez‚Äôs performance during the 2023 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby.   The two-time Super Bowl champion tweeted:         ‚ÄúThat was wild!!! @JRODshow44‚Äù           Patrick Mahomes II@PatrickMahomesThat was wild!!! @JRODshow442683242 For context, here‚Äôs how the Dominican Republic native performed in front of his team‚Äôs fans. Rodriguez knocked down tons of home runs in a short amount of time during the event. Even the commentators could not believe his hot batting.  SportsGridRadio@SportsGridRadio@PatrickMahomes @JRODshow44231     Aside from recognizing his fellow athletes, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes enjoys baseball because he has some competitive baseball experience. His father, Pat Mahomes, was also an MLB pitcher for nine seasons, suiting up for six teams, including the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs.  Rodriguez knocked down 41 home runs in three minutes during the first round of the MLB 2023 Home Run Derby. It was enough to defeat the 21 dingers by New York Mets first baseman Pete Alonso.  Unfortunately, Rodriguez‚Äôs bat cooled down in the second round, losing to Toronto Blue Jays‚Äô baseman/designated hitter Vladimir Guerrero Jr., 21-20.  The timer for each round starts when the first pitch has been thrown. Competitors also receive an additional 30 seconds after regulation time expires. They can also get a minute of added time if they convert at least two home runs of at least 440 feet in distance from home plate.  Aside from Rodriguez, Alonso, Guerrero and Arozarena, Patrick Mahomes was thrilled to watch the likes of Luis Robert Jr., Adley Rutschman, Adolis Garcia and Mookie Betts compete.      Guerrero Jr. competed in the final round against Tampa Bay Rays left fielder Randy Arozarena. They have two minutes each to knock down as many home runs as possible.  Guerrero Jr. defeated Arozarena in the final round, 25-23, to win the 2023 MLB Home Run Derby. He will take home $1 million from the $2.5 million prize pool.  Patrick Mahomes played baseball in high school  The two-time NFL Most Valuable Player was a three-sport athlete at Whitehouse High School in Texas. Aside from football, he also competed in basketball and baseball.  He believes participating in the other two sports helped develop his throwing accuracy and mobility.  Patrick Mahomes‚Äô baseball skills were good enough for the Detroit Tigers to select him in the 37th round of the 2014 MLB Draft. However, he did not sign a contract with the squad.  His future was in football, and it undoubtedly was the right decision. After a solid collegiate football stint at Texas Tech, the Kansas City Chiefs selected him as the No. 10 pick in the 2017 NFL Draft.      Since then, Mahomes has been delivering his brand of home run throws to Travis Kelce and other Chiefs receivers. His command of the Chiefs‚Äô offense, especially in clutch situations, helped him earn victories in Super Bowls LIV and LVII. Furthermore, he is a two-time Super Bowl MVP and a three-time All-Pro member.      ']"
61,Aaron Rodgers,"['Aaron Rodgers\' ayahuasca confession irks Mike Florio  Aaron Rodgers is regarded by many as the most talented quarterback to grace the gridiron. His pinpoint passing accuracy and ability to take a game by the scruff of the neck has made him a treat to watch for NFL fans.  With a Super Bowl ring and four league MVP\'s to his name, one could argue that the quarterback has earned the right to voice his opinion. But his recent criticism of the Green Bay Packers\' young wide receivers hasn\'t gone down well with many.                     Rodgers voiced his concerns about their performance at training camp. He also downplayed the importance of him not being at OTAs. But NFL analyst Mike Florio iargued against this logic. Appearing on Pro Football Talk, Florio went off on Rodgers. He feels he could\'ve helped his young core of receivers settle in by not skipping practice. Especially since he went to South America to take psychedelics: ""I reject his argument. And obviously, he is biased. He\'s not going to come out and say, \'Yeah, maybe they wouldn\'t be having these struggles if I had chosen to be here during the offseason program instead of being on an ayahuasca high somewhere.\'""        Florio maintained that the Packers would definitely not have been worse off had their starting quarterback been around for reps: ""The bottom line is they would have been better off. They wouldn\'t be worse off. They would have been better off if he\'d have been there.""  Aaron Rodgers believes Ayahuasca trip helped him win back-to-back MVP titles     Green Bay Packers v San Francisco 49ers Reigning NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers appeared on the Aubrey Marcus podcast earlier this month to talk about all things mental health. This included his dabble with psychedelics. In an eye-opening exchange, the quarterback spoke at length about his experience with ayahuasca: ""To me, one of the core tenets of your mental health is self-love. That‚Äôs what ayahuasca did for me, was help me see how to unconditionally love myself. It‚Äôs only in that unconditional self love, that then I‚Äôm able to truly, unconditionally love others. And what better way to work on my mental health than to have an experience like that?""     The quarterback continued by saying that the experience likely paved the way for him to play some of the best football of his career: ""I don\'t think it\'s a coincidence. I really don\'t. I don\'t really believe in coincidences at this point. It\'s the universe bringing things to happen when they\'re supposed to happen."" Rodgers revealed that he has tried experimenting with psychedelic mushrooms as well. He once felt himself ""merge with the ocean"" under the influence of the drug.          The admission has been met with a mixed response by the NFL world. Which is consistent with everything Aaron Rodgers does. Whether it will help him win another league MVP and push for the Super Bowl, that remains to be seen.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Pro Football Talk, the Aubrey Marcus podcast and H/T Sportskeeda.

Ever since it was revealed that the New York Jets quarterback is a massive ""Swiftie"" as they\'re called, it\'s all anyone can talk about.  On The Pat McAfee Show, the team discussed Swift\'s recently-reported split from the 1975 frontman Matty Healy, who she allegedly dated in the wake of her breakup with actor Joe Alwyn.                     McAfee said: ""Matt Healy, who I saw kissing a security guard at his concert I believe just like two days ago. Public, very public kiss on a man\'s face. So now, Taylor, gonna write an album I assume about Mr. Healy and this tour is just going to go on to do $10 billion and just maybe never stop. Is she gonna be able to tour forever? What does Taylor Swift do next, AJ Hawk?""     Hawk, who played with Rodgers in Green Bay, suggested the two should meet up: ""What does she do? I don\'t know. She had a high profile quarterback go to at least two of her three shows."" This was met with a raucous response, and McAfee prodded further. Hawk continued: ""I\'m saying he should throw his name in the hat. Let her know he\'s interested.""        McAfee added: ""Bro, he\'s got too many favorite songs to just list of one or two from Taylor Swift as he was jogging off field the other day on Friday at the end of the OTAs. He said, \'Is there another Taylor Swift concert this weekend at MetLife?\' He does seem to be a little bit uh, tripping b*lls."" Hawk seems to want them to get together since they are both single.  Aaron Rodgers is a massive fan of Taylor Swift As is the unfortunate custom in today\'s society, odds have been placed on who Swift will date next.

When you set the screen, our guards attack downhill, attack Claxton or Morris and just put it on the rim.

Watch highlights of Anthony Davis\' big night below:        Anthony Davis finished with 37 points and 18 rebounds, 10 of which were offensive rebounds.  The LA Lakers beat the Brooklyn Nets to improve to 3-10 on the season. Meanwhile, Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers beat the Dallas Cowboys 31-28 to improve to 4-6.  Can Anthony Davis lead LA Lakers to postseason? Despite the win over the Brooklyn Nets, the LA Lakers have been one of the worst teams in the NBA thus far.  The Lakers are 3-10 following a slow start from LeBron James. The Lakers star has battled injuries and is averaging 24.9 points per game, but he\'s shooting just 45.7% from the field, 23.9% from the 3-point range, and 66.7% from the free-throw line. His points per game and field goal percentage are the lowest since his rookie season, while his 3-point percentage is the lowest of his career. While James deserves the benefit of the doubt that he will turn things around when fully healthy, the Lakers need Anthony Davis to continue his strong play.     Through 12 games, Davis is averaging 24.3 points per game while shooting a career-high 54.2%. Additionally, Davis is averaging 11.2 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 1.8 blocks and 1.3 steals per game. His 1.7 win shares are tied for tenth in the NBA, while his 26.3 player efficiency rating is ninth best.While the Lakers have dug an early hole, they are only a few games of a postseason spot. As the season progresses, Davis and James will continue to get healthier, as will the roster around them. If the two stars stay healthy, the Lakers should be able to claw their way back into playoff contention.

NFL analysts think Packers should sit Aaron Rodgers out, instead of pursuing number 1 seed Dominique Foxworth, an NFL analyst appearing on ESPN‚Äôs Get Up, offered his candid thoughts on the matter: ""A healthy Aaron Rodgers is more important than a first-round bye. I understand the first-round bye is important. They can still get the first-round bye if they drop another game, but no one believes that, if his toe at some point, he re-aggravates it, makes it worse."" ""No one believes they have any chance. My point is none of this (the first round bye) is a guarantee. What is guaranteed is a week off for him. It‚Äôs better for him. My only point is that the longer, the more you put them out there in this condition, that his injury could worsen. If you take them off the field at one point, you could still get the one seed.""

Over the years, he‚Äôs credited the superstar quarterback for giving him the inspiration to dominate the NBA. Rodgers‚Äô magic words certainly worked tonight as the Bucks, even with Antetokounmpo and Lopez around, were hardly able to contain Davis. AD shot 18-27 from the field, including numerous timely baskets that kept Milwaukee at bay throughout the game. Besides causing trouble for the Bucks on offense, Anthony Davis was also the Lakers‚Äô lynchpin on defense. Not many can make Giannis Antetokounmpo hesitate when he drives to the basket, but Davis certainly did that on a few occasions. Over the last three weeks, AD has reminded everyone in the NBA that he‚Äôs arguably the best player in the league when healthy and engaged. Davis, if he can sustain this performance, should unquestionably be a hot name in the MVP race.      Anthony Davis took what the Milwaukee Bucks gave him The Milwaukee Bucks threw everything at Anthony Davis and the Lakers superstar still dominated. The biggest criticism during Anthony Davis‚Äô rampaging run has been the lack of interior presence to keep him from dominating. Against the Bucks, Davis faced arguably the NBA‚Äôs premiere inside stoppers in Giannis Antetokounmpo and Brook Lopez. ‚ÄúThe Greek Freak‚Äù is a former Defensive Player of the Year winner and is probably the game‚Äôs most versatile defender. Milwaukee also has Lopez, who is making a strong case for being the best defender in the NBA this season.     Here‚Äôs what Anthony Davis had to say about how he attacked the Milwaukee Bucks‚Äô defense: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always confident in every shot that I take. Just knowing how they play, Brook [Lopez] being down on the floor, Giannis [Antetokounmpo] being down on the floor, it wasn‚Äôt probably going to be a get-to-the-rim game, so just trying to shoot over the top. And then after you make a couple, they start to close out.‚Äù         Davis‚Äô jumper has deservedly been maligned over the past two years. He was so bad that opponents weren‚Äôt even going to contest him around the perimeter. At the start of the season, AD mentioned having a little problem with his wrist and that he was thinking too much about his shot.Anthony Davis has figured it out and is looking unstoppable even with the best defenders arrayed against him.

', ""3 worst games of Aaron Rodgers' career with the Packers  Aaron Rodgers has been one of the best quarterbacks for the Green Bay Packers for the majority of his long-standing career. On top of being the glue that has held the Packers together for his 15-plus years on the team, he boasts a 3x MVP record on top of a 3x passer rating record.  Both those records included the 2020 season when it seemed like the Packers could not be stopped. Being the best at something doesn't necessarily mean that doesn't come with bad days, though. Has Aaron Rodgers had worse outings in a Green Bay shirt than the Week 1 performance against the Saints? After last Sunday's atrocious performance, here's a look at Aaron Rodgers' worst performances with the Packers.        Down but not out: The best of Rodgers' most non-Rodgers-esque performances in a Green Bay shirt            #1 Green Bay Packers vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Sept 28, 2008 Aaron Rodgers could not seem to get anything going during the game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers back in 2008. Rodgers has only thrown three picks in a game three times in his career. This was one of those games. The Bucs defense was relentless. On top of Rodgers throwing three interceptions, he barely completed half of his attempts. A 14-27 completion day is not an Aaron Rodgers day. The star quarterback was sacked three times in that game as well. Rodgers' passer rating that day was 55.9 and his QBR was 13.4. The Bucs defense included notable names like Aqib Talib and Ronde Barber. The defense amounted to three sacks and two defensive TDs.     #2 Green Bay Packers vs Buffalo Bills, Dec 14, 2014 Rodgers had an even worse game when the Packers took on the Buffalo Bills in December 2014. Usually, that is when the Packers are in full-blown playoff mode, but Rodgers couldn't escape the pressure from the Bills. Rodgers had only thrown three interceptions the entire season before the game. The Bills' resolute defense led Rodgers to add two more interceptions to his season total. Rodgers also only completed 17-42 pass attempts that night. His embarrassing passer rating was 34.3 and his QBR was an all-time low of 12.4. The Bills defense amounted to one sack, two tackles for loss, 10 QB hits and one defensive touchdown. Notable names Stephon Gilmore, Mario Williams and Baccari Rambo made sure Rodgers felt their presence that day. #3 Green Bay Packers vs New Orleans Saints, Sep 12, 2021 This takes the list to Rodgers' worst game to date. The New Orleans Saints embarrassed the Packers worse than anyone ever has with Rodgers at the helm.     Rodgers did not seem to look like his usual self in Week 1 this year. In fact, all of the rookie QBs that played Sunday were leaps and bounds better than Rodgers. NFL Research@NFLResearchThe Saints defense held 2020 NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers to a 36.8 passer rating todayThat is the lowest passer rating in history by a reigning NFL MVP in his first game of the subsequent season #GBvsNO6:25 AM ¬∑ Sep 12, 20211221232 Rodgers posted his worst passer rating ever at 36.8, coupled with a QBR of 13.4. The Saints embarrassed the Packers on every level. The Packers QB ended the day with 15-28 pass attempts and two INTs. He was sacked two times. The Saints defense, which includes notables like Marshon Lattimore and Marcus Davenport, made sure Rodgers did not get comfortable the entire day.     Matthew Berry@MatthewBerryTMRAaron Rodgers ends Week 1 as QB 35 in fantasy points. Only 32 teams played.6:30 AM ¬∑ Sep 14, 20215788348 The final score of 38-3 made everyone take a double-take. If this is to be Rodgers' final season for the Green Bay Packers, then there should be a wonderful send-off, not a tanking of epic proportions.Rodgers needs to find his footing, or the Packers' season is doomed before it begins, and the memes will take center stage, and that's not a fun time to be a Packer.      "", 'Aaron Rodgers is loving life since using psychedelic drug  Aaron Rodgers made headlines during the 2022 offseason with a shocking admission. He admitted that he took the psychedelic drug ayahuasca prior to the start of the 2020 season and that it helped him improve his game.  Rodgers recently appeared on an episode of the Pat McAfee Show and discussed how he believes taking ayahuasca has benefited his career. McAfee asked him if he\'s been enjoying football more lately, and here\'s how Rodgers responded:        ""I\'ve been enjoying football since I did ayahuasca. So the last few years have been great.""           McAfee jumped back in: ""Then we\'ll talk ayahuasca, because I\'ve got a lot of questions. Your love of football though, since ayahuasca, why? New mindset, new vision on things, new look at things? Well, how come?"" Rodgers responded: ""Yeah. Mental health, bro. It starts with self-love and when you increase that, then you\'re able to pass that on more easily. And listen, the locker room is where the chemistry takes place. There\'s a lot of great things that happen on the practice field, and obviously in the game, and outside the facility is fun, and dinners and different things. But the locker room, that\'s the core of that connection.""     Pat McAfee@PatMcAfeeShow""I\'ve been really enjoying football since I did ayahuasca.. the locker room is where the chemistry takes place"" ~@AaronRodgers12#PMSLive45842 Rodgers basically said that taking ayahuasca has helped his overall mindset. He also believes the chemistry he has gained through these relationships has had a direct impact on his performance in the NFL.         Aaron Rodgers has elevated his game since taking ayahuasca Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers Aaron Rodgers admitted to taking ayahuasca on a vacation in South America this offseason as well. He has appeared in two seasons with the Green Bay Packers since first taking the psychedelic drug, winning the NFL MVP in each of them. The Recount@therecountGreen Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers credits his back-to-back MVPs to the psychoactive brew ayahuasca:""I had a magical experience with the sensation of feeling 100 different hands on my body imparting a blessing of love and forgiveness for myself and gratitude for this life ...""38383     While it\'s unclear if ayahuasca had any direct impact on his performance, there\'s no denying he\'s played incredibly since taking it. Over the last two regular seasons, he has combined to throw 85 touchdowns against just nine interceptions. He\'s completed 70 percent of his passes, and has exceeded 4,000 passing yards each season. He has been one of the best overall players in the league.Rodgers looks set for a huge season with the Packers. They are looking for a run at the Super Bowl and need their star to play at his best in the upcoming campaign.

', 'NFL fans demand Packers bench Aaron Rodgers for Jordan Love for rest of the season  Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has had a season from hell in 2022.   After losing Davante Adams in the offseason to the Las Vegas Raiders, Rodgers and the Packers have simply not been the same. Their defeat against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday Night Football saw them drop to a disappointing 4-8 on the season.         The loss essentially ruled them out of a playoff spot, although they are mathematically not eliminated just yet.           Back-up Jordan Love stepped in for the injured Rodgers against the Eagles and looked decent as he threw a 63-yard touchdown to Christian Watson. Love\'s performance was solid enough for NFL fans to suggest that he should start over Rodgers. One fan tweeted: ""The future is now old man.""

Because we\'re 4-8, the season is over, there\'s nothing else to play for so you might as well see what the kids got.8 Josh@LUISGARCIASZN@packers Love is the future6 Aaron Rodgers has not looked like his usual MVP level best in 2022 and many have called a switch at quarterback. With Green Bay\'s season basically done and dusted, the loud cries for Jordan Love to start over Rodgers have now become deafening.      Will it happen?  Aaron Rodgers and Packers\' season down the drain with Eagles loss Green Bay Packers v Philadelphia Eagles Green Bay simply had to beat Philadelphia on Sunday Night Football to keep their slim hopes of a playoff berth alive. However, with their eighth defeat of the season, those hopes seem to be over. As mentioned above, Jordan Love came in for the injured Aaron Rodgers, who said post-game that he suffered a rib injury and that he found it tough to breathe. Love, who has been much-maligned since arriving in Wisconsin, looked far better than he previously had.     NFL@NFLJordan Love. Christian Watson. One-possession game in Philly : #GBvsPHI on NBC: Stream on NFL+ bit.ly/3V712dU2524326 He completed six of his nine passes for 113 yards and that touchdown to Watson on a slant route. Reigning MVP Rodgers himself wasn\'t too bad despite his two interceptions as he completed 11 of his 16 passes for 140 yards and two touchdowns. The 40-33 loss, for most, is the green light that will give Love the keys to the team for the rest of the season. There will clearly be pushback from Rodgers, but the majority of Packers fans seem to feel it is time to pass the torch.     Matt Schneidman@mattschneidmanAaron Rodgers said he suffered a ribs injury. He was worried about a punctured lung.

62,DeShone Kizer,"['Ranking the 10 Worst NFL QBs of the 2010s  Quarterback is the most important position in the NFL and that won‚Äôt change for as long as the sport is played.  Over the past decade, we‚Äôve seen some simply stupendous players throw the ball in the NFL, keeping fans astounded on a weekly basis. They impressed one and all with their feats of magic with the ball in their hands.        Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson have all but revolutionised their positions since being drafted, yet not every player can have such a positive impact. As is impossible to avoid, for every success story in the NFL, there is an equally negative outcome for another individual.           The 2010s saw some quite awful quarterback play from a number of guilty parties. Some were so bad that an infamous play is now named after them, whilst others failed to live up to expectations due to an out-of-control off-field life.  Who were the 10 worst NFL quarterbacks of the 2010s? #10 Geno Smith Baltimore Ravens v New York Jets     Geno Smith had talent at the quarterback position, but describing his career in the NFL as a negative snowball would be an understatement. However, it\'s not entirely his fault that he arrived at a poor New York Jets team that was bereft of leadership and veteran presence who were used to winning. After being drafted in the second round of the 2013 NFL Draft, Smith would hugely struggle with interceptions in his first two years, throwing a grand total of 34. He didn‚Äôt inspire any confidence within the locker room either. This ultimately culminated in an unfortunate incident. His own teammate, IK Enemkpali, broke his jaw with a right hook that left Smith out injured for most of the 2015 season. He never regained his place, and has since gone onto become a backup option with the Giants, Chargers and Seahawks. But in terms of quarterback production, Smith stands as one of the worst of the 2010s.      #9 Blaine Gabbert Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Jacksonville Jaguars Thrown into the dumpster fire that has been Jacksonville football for the best part of a decade, Blaine Gabbert has had a forgetful NFL career. It is worth nothing, however, that he is classed as a Super Bowl winner. Gabbert rode Tom Brady‚Äôs coattails to a championship in Tampa Bay, throwing a grand total of 27 passes in three years. But he remains one of the most disappointing picks of the previous decade. Picked 10th overall in the 2011 NFL Draft, Gabbert had a below average rookie year where he threw just 12 touchdown passes, as well as 11 interceptions. He was also sacked 40 times and fumbled the ball on 14 occasions.     It was a setback that he never recovered from, with the Jacksonville Jaguars never really having patience with him as a long-term starter again.  #8 Mark Sanchez New England Patriots v New York Jets Picked up by the New York Jets with the fifth overall pick in 2009, Mark Sanchez was supposed to save NFL football in the Big Apple. Instead, he is somehow remembered the most for his ""butt-fumble."" Ironically, the four years he had as a starter in New York were four of the better years the Jets have had for a long time. They had a strong roster that just needed a better quarterback. Sanchez made too many mistakes, some at the costliest moments, and that became his legacy.     He never finished a season with the Jets without at least nine fumbles. The butt-fumble was the worst of the lot. Not only did Sanchez misread what the play was supposed to be, but he didn‚Äôt have the awareness to know where his own O-Line were positioned. While attempting to slide to safety to avoid Vince Wilfork, he slid into the backside of one of the O-Line members, fumbling the ball in the process. Tobey MaCrier@shaneysmalls@BarstoolPhilly The Sanchez Butt Fumble New York soon lost patience and Sanchez was out, with a specific QB training session called ""The Sanchez Program"" to eliminate QB fumbles being created.      #7 Jake Locker Tennessee Titans v Houston Texans The 2011 NFL Draft saw another QB taken earlier, with Jake Locker going to the Tennessee Titans at #8. When an NFL career lasts four seasons, with a player being a nailed-on starter in just one of them, that tells you everything you need to know. Locker was a backup in his rookie year and was then chosen to lead the Titans in his second year. In 11 starts, he threw for more interceptions than touchdowns and fumbled the ball four times.     Injuries followed, but Locker couldn‚Äôt escape the poor performances when he was on the field. He retired in 2015 citing a loss of passion for the sport, cementing his place as one of the biggest busts of the 2010s.  #6 Brandon Weeden Cleveland Browns v Denver Broncos Another name on the lengthy list of Cleveland Browns QB failures, Brandon Weeden arrived in 2012 as the 22nd pick at 28 years of age. His professional MLB career began with the New York Yankees in 2002, yet just a decade later he was in the NFL.     You have to commend the work ethic, but his career in professional football went exactly as you‚Äôd expect. He started 15 games as a rookie, throwing 14 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. These stats are alarming, but nowhere near as bad as some on this list. However, he just lacked the pop needed to survive in the NFL. His passes were simply not accurate enough and he was never going to take the team to the next level. Weeden\'s poor displays saw him constantly benched throughout his second year in Cleveland, and he was released at the end of the 2012 season.  #5 Christian Ponder Minnesota Vikings v Green Bay Packers     The sample size of Christian Ponder as an NFL quarterback is admittedly much larger than that of others on this list. But that just purely gives us more evidence to understand how bad he was. Given the starting job in Minnesota for three seasons after being drafted 12th overall in 2011, Ponder‚Äôs returns were woeful. His entire career with the Vikings ended with 38 touchdowns and 36 interceptions, as well as 20 fumbles. Ponder struggled to read defenses, even three years into life in the NFL, and he panicked as soon as any defender got near the pocket. He was one of those players who simply didn‚Äôt have the makeup to be an NFL quarterback.  #4 Josh Rosen Arizona Cardinals v Seattle Seahawks     Josh Rosen arrived into the NFL with a lot of hype as part of one of the most stacked QB draft classes in years. He was selected 10th overall by the Arizona Cardinals in 2018, but doubts were raised about his abilities and fit immediately. He would start just 13 games in his one and only year in Arizona, throwing 14 interceptions to 11 touchdowns. Rosen was sacked 45 times and fumbled the ball on 10 occasions to boot. It was a historically bad year for the Cardinals QB, and ironically one which helped the franchise out immensely. They were able to pick first overall in 2019 and got Kyler Murray, the replacement for Rosen. The latter was traded immediately to Miami, where he would start just three games, losing all of them whilst throwing just one touchdown and five interceptions. Rosen didn‚Äôt play at all in 2020 with the San Francisco 49ers, whilst in 2021, he threw just 11 passes all season, two of which were interceptions.     It‚Äôs hard to fathom the 10th overall pick being bounced between four teams in as many years. As a free agent in 2022, his NFL career is essentially over, and it is one of the most forgettable in living memory.  #3 DeShone Kizer Green Bay Packers v Baltimore Ravens Cleveland features heavily on this list, unsurprisingly, and DeShone Kizer was another name they drafted and spat out after years of disappointing performances. Hue Jackson wanted Colin Kaepernick signed, but received Kizer and oversaw the latter play his part in the 0-16 season.     Kizer started a full 15 games in the 2017 NFL season, but his performances were appalling. He completed just 53.6% of his passes, threw double the number of interceptions to touchdowns with 22 and 11 respectively, and fumbled the ball nine times. The fact that he led an NFL team to only the second ever 0-16 season is telling, and he never got to be a starter again. Kizer was traded to Green Bay after his rookie year, where he would throw 42 passes, no touchdowns and two interceptions. He has not played an NFL snap since and is unlikely to ever do so again.  #2 Johnny Manziel Cleveland Browns v Buffalo Bills     The only thing stopping Manziel from reaching the top spot on this list is that he had some natural talent as a quarterback. It‚Äôs almost entirely his own fault that he had such an abysmal career in the NFL. Selected by the Browns, every quarterback‚Äôs favourite franchise, Johnny Football entered the NFL as a celebrity before he had achieved anything at the pro-level. A rookie QB being fined for a hand-gesture made towards opposing fans in a pre-season loss is almost unheard of. Yet Manziel made it a reality. He would be judged accurately by the Browns‚Äô coaching staff, who started Manziel in just two NFL games in 2014. He threw two interceptions and no touchdowns. Many expected 2015 to be the comeback year for Johnny Football. He was settled in Cleveland, but that proved to be his undoing as he appeared to party constantly. That year, he started six games and threw seven touchdowns to five interceptions, but his play was nothing more than below average by quite some distance.     A domestic violence incident was the last straw for the Browns. They were so desperate to get rid of Manziel, theyeven released a statement suggesting his future would be addressed ""as soon as permitted by league rules."" He never played in the NFL again.  #1 Paxton Lynch Atlanta Falcons v Denver Broncos Paxton Lynch was never a first-round calibre quarterback. He was then thrown into an awful situation created by the Denver Broncos and their mismanagement of Peyton Manning‚Äôs retirement. Once in the NFL, Lynch was just awful.     He would never do enough to convince the Broncos that he was starting QB material. Lynch played for the defending Super Bowl champions and threw just two touchdowns in his rookie season. His second season was no better, as he struggled to even get time on the field. The Broncos knew he was a bust and the rest of the watching world did too. Josh Kellem@JoshuaKellem#Broncos traded up for Paxton Lynch during 2016 #NFLDraft he\'s now getting outplayed by Case Cookus(?) in the #USFL if patient, team could\'ve drafted Dak Prescott on Day 2. crazy Lbroncoswire.usatoday.com/2022/06/07/usf‚Ä¶1 He threw 128 passes in the NFL with four being touchdowns and four being interceptions. For a first-round selection, that is a dreadful return on investment.     Lynch then had spells on the practice squads of Seattle and Pittsburgh, never doing enough to earn a deal. His NFL career was as short as it was dismal as a result.He was most recently picked in the 12th round of the United States Football League draft after playing as a third-string QB in the Canadian Football League.

The former Atlanta Falcons and Indianapolis Colts quarterback said that he was excited to work with the network and that he was really looking forward to talking about the game. He then added a message at the end of his Twitter caption that made it clear that this wasn\'t his way of retiring. ""Excited to join the @NFLonCBS family!

Looking forward to breaking down the game this season. P.S. - this is not a retirement post 148101261 The quarterback was released by the Indianapolis Colts earlier this offseason. The Colts traded for the quarterback last summer after he played 14 seasons with the Atlanta Falcons. While he hasn\'t signed with another NFL team this offseason, many NFL fans believe that this was the next part of his career. But, it appears that he hasn\'t fully given up on his ability to play in the National Football League as of yet. And, it appears that if the doors open with an opportunity in the NFL, he may just jump at the chance to suit up once again.This may indicate that he has a clause in his contract with CBS Sports that he could leave for the NFL if need be.     ', '""Got no time to waste, every opportunity could be the last one"" - LA Lakers\' new recruit speaks out after making big statement against Golden State Warriors in preseason win  LA Lakers\' most recent acquisition, Matt Ryan, put on a solid shooting display in the fourth quarter against the Golden State Warriors. Ryan only played during the fourth quarter and wasted no time sinking in consecutive 3-point shots.   After the game concluded, Lakers reporter Mike Trudell initiated a post-game interview with Matt Ryan. As a new player on the roster, Trudell curiously asked what Ryan\'s mindset was after finally securing an opportunity.        ""For a player of my position, it\'s just staying ready for an opportunity and try to make the most of it whenever it comes,"" Ryan said. ""Got no time to waste, every opportunity could be the last one.""      Trudell also wanted to talk about Ryan\'s shooting and how he felt playing in front of LeBron James and Stephen Curry. ""I love it! I knew I was shooting well, and I just needed to keep shooting,"" Ryan said. ""I\'m very fortunate and thankful to get another opportunity tonight after having a couple of off-games."" In the first two preseason games with the LA Lakers, Matt Ryan wasn\'t exactly performing well. He finally got his shot at redemption last night, proving he can sink in shots. Ryan scored 20 points, dropping in 6 out of 9 shots from deep. If he can deliver performances like this one in the regular season, the Lakers may often have a deadly sharpshooter to utilize.     Spectrum SportsNet@SpectrumSN""I got no time to waste."" - Matt Ryan speaks with @LakersReporter after making a big statement (20 points, 6/9 3-pointers, 20 minutes) against the Warriors.1081140  LA Lakers defeats the Golden State Warriors; achieving their first victory of the 2022 preseason Sacramento Kings v Los Angeles Lakers     It appears the LA Lakers are finally on the right track this preseason. Anthony Davis led the team to victory, defeating the Golden State Warriors 124-121. Neither team was in full force. The only All-Stars playing was AD and Steph Curry. Nevertheless, it was still an impressive victory for LA as they showed what they could do even without LeBron James and Russell Westbrook playing. Anthony Davis proved last night that he\'s still capable of carrying his team. He dominated every quarter he played, sinking in some 3-point shots, mid-range jumpers, and finishing lob passes. Davis scored 28 points and had three rebounds and three assists in 21 minutes of play.  Although it was a close matchup, the Warriors had more star power in their lineup compared to the Lakers. Aside from Steph Curry, Golden State also had Andrew Wiggins and Jordan Poole in the mix. It was an impressive showing by the Lakers\' role players. They stepped up to the occasion of dethroning the defending champs.     Kendrick Nunn has been an asset for the LA Lakers since returning from an 11-month injury. Last night, he put up 21 points, seven assists and four rebounds. Nunn effectively created his own shots and stunned the Warriors with his stop-and-pop shooting. It might be too early, but if the LA Lakers can keep up performances like this, we might see the team accomplish a comeback season.       ', 'Skip Bayless rails LeBron James for a sluggish performance against Pelicans: ‚ÄúYou could have that Jordan flu game against the wounded Pelicans‚Äù  LeBron James and the LA Lakers are starting to find their groove. They are on a two-game win streak after opening the season with five straight losses.  The Lakers beat the New Orleans Pelicans 120-117 in overtime. One of the stories of the game was LeBron James\' health. James was reportedly feeling the effects of an illness that had him bedridden for three days.        James overcame the illness to finish with 20 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists in 40 minutes of action. But don\'t let the statline fool you. James struggled with his shot all game long. He shot just 9-for-23 from the field and 0-for-7 from 3-point range.      On a recent episode of ""Skip and Shannon: Undisputed,"" co-host Skip Bayless analyzed LeBron James\' performance against the Pelicans. He wasn\'t impressed with the 18-time All-Star. He thought James\' teammates bailed him out. ""I never thought I would see the night that somebody named Matt Ryan would take LeBron off the hook for choking his guts out."" ""He was choking his guts out. Once again, right on cue. I keep telling you, LeBron does not have the closer gene.""

I never thought somebody named Matt Ryan would take LeBron off the hook for choking his guts out."" ‚Äî @RealSkipBayless17416      LeBron James and LA Lakers look to keep momentum going Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James After a nightmarish start to the season, the LA Lakers are building some confidence. But there\'s still plenty of work to be done. The team is still three games under .500. Their upcoming schedule will present some challenges. The Lakers will take on the red-hot Utah Jazz on Friday, following which they will face the Cleveland Cavaliers, who have one of the best records in the NBA. The Lakers will take it one game at a time. The way they\'ve performed lately is promising.     The most encouraging sign for the Lakers is their ability to win games when LeBron James is struggling. James has shot 42.2% from the field and 16.7% from 3-point range in the last two games. Dave McMenamin@mctenLeBron James said there was ‚Äúsomething going around‚Äù that hit him pretty bad and he was bed-ridden from the Nuggets game until today with the illness. He said he plans to go straight to bed tonight for more rest. It even caused him to miss the team Halloween party.4183288 The Lakers continue to get production off the bench from All-Star guard Russell Westbrook. Westbrook has averaged 15.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 8.5 assists in the Lakers\' two wins. He also shot 54.5% from the field. It looked like their season was spiraling out of control. But the Lakers have found life. They will have to play more consistently to keep up with the tough competition in the Western Conference.The hope is that James can return to form after an extra day of rest. Despite his recent stretch of performances, James has been sensational this season. He\'s averaged 25.0 points, 9.0 rebounds and 7.4 assists through seven games.     ', ""Who is Matt Ryan? Tracing the former G League player's path to NBA and LA Lakers  When the Los Angeles Lakers played the defending champions Golden State Warriors in their pre-season clash yesterday, Matt Ryan stole the limelight. Everyone expected LeBron James, Stephen Curry or youngster Jordan Poole to be in focus, but Matt Ryan became the talk of the game instead.  As the opening night draws closer, NBA teams are starting to round out their roster. Throughout the summer, the media has focused on the Los Angeles Lakers' attempt to re-construct their roster after a disappointing season. The Lakers General Manager and President of Basketball Operations, Rob Pelinka, has surrounded LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook with small athletic guards and bigs.        However, outside shooting is a glaring problem with the Lakers' roster. With the need for outside shooting at an all-time high, the Lakers might look towards G League sharpshooter Matt Ryan.       Ryan had a great shooting night against the Warriors, and his performance even led to appreciation from LeBron James. Ryan launched all of his shots from beyond the three-point arc, connecting on 6-9 shooting from deep. That said, he didn't impact the game in any other way. Matt Ryan's journey so far Matt Ryan entered the NBA draft in 2020, but the 6-foot-7 wing went undrafted. He played for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Summer League.  Ryan then had a couple of stints with the Denver Nuggets and Boston Celtics, but barely made the teams. He spent most of this time playing for their G-League affiliates, the Grand Rapids Gold and Maine Celtics. Matt Ryan is known for his shooting prowess. And with the Lakers desperate to add shooting to their roster, he might have a chance of making an NBA roster. However, like most undrafted players, Ryan has many weak spots in his game.     One advantage in Ryan's favor is the lack of big wings on the Lakers' roster. The Lakers will constantly need bodies to guard Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo. If the former Notre Dame player can shore up his defense, he will have a real chance to get some quality minutes on the Lakers roster. With LeBron James entering his 20th season and Anthony Davis not durable enough to grind it out every game, Matt Ryan could make a case to be a rotation wing in coach Ham's new system.Current Lakers' player development coach Phil Handy is among the best in the business at what he does. Matt Ryan may well end up being his next great developmental gem.     "", ""NFL: 3 Reasons Why Matt Ryan should be a Hall of Famer  With the Indianapolis Colts releasing long-time NFL signal-caller Matt Ryan after just one disappointing season, Ryan's career could be coming to a close. The question that most fans, analysts, and insiders alike have when a good player retires is whether that player is a future Hall of Famer or not.  With Matt Ryan, it is a very curious case. The former MVP put up prolific numbers, especially during his 14 seasons in Atlanta. However, he doesn't have a Super Bowl ring to show for it. Are his great numbers good enough to get him into Canton? Let's take a closer look.        Ryan's Historic Arm           To say Matt Ryan made a career with his right arm is a bit of an understatement. According to Pro Football Reference, the 4-time Pro-Bowler ranks 7th all-time in career passing yards (62,792). He sits at No. 5 all-time in passes completed with 5,551. Additionally, he is 9th all-time in passing touchdowns with a career mark of 381. The former Boston College star threw for over 4,000 passing yards in 10 of his 14 career seasons in Atlanta. He has an NFL record for the most consecutive 200-yard performances in NFL history (64). He is one of the most accomplished throwers in football in the long history of the National Football League.        Matt Ryan's All-Time Awards Ryan's career portfolio, aside from the numbers, is incredibly impressive. Again, he is a 4-time Pro-Bowler and former league MVP (2016-17). On separate occasions, he has also led the NFL in passer rating (2016) and completion percentage (2012). Ryan is also a former Rookie of the Year (2008) and former Offensive Player of the Year (2016). Despite a forgetful 2022 season with the Colts, Matt Ryan has had a historic career. He is the Falcons' all-time leading passer in attempts, completions, yards, touchdowns, passer rating, and 300-yard games. If you are arguably the best player in the history of the franchise, Canton should be within your grasp. That is exactly the case for Matt Ryan. No Super Bowl Doesn't Mean No Hall of Fame Despite not having a Super Bowl ring on his shelf, Ryan still has a good shot at the Hall of Fame. Aside from his Hall of Fame numbers, the Pro Football Hall of Fame has a history of welcoming in quarterbacks who lack a Super Bowl ring.     The likes of Fran Tarkenton, Dan Marino, Jim Kelly, and Warren Moon are all notable quarterbacks who have bronze busts in Canton, OH. Matt Ryan has more passing yards and a better passer rating than all three of them.Ryan has great all-time numbers on his side. There is no question about that. Additionally, he has history on his side when it comes to similar quarterbacks making the Hall of Fame without a Super Bowl ring. Is Ryan deserving of the Hall of Fame? Yes, he undoubtedly is.     "", 'LeBron James trolled by Skip Bayless after Matt Ryan\'s clutch play: ""I never thought... somebody named Matt Ryan... would take LeBron off the hook for choking his guts out.""  LeBron James and the LA Lakers kept their win streak going Wednesday night thanks to the play of an unlikely hero. Down three in the final seconds, a play was run for Matt Ryan, who nailed a corner 3 as time expired to send the game into overtime.  From there, the Lakers went on to win by a final score of 120-117. Along with his big shot down the stretch, Ryan posted 11 points and converted on three of his nine attempts from beyond the arc.        The morning after this OT thriller, Skip Bayless went on FS1\'s ""Skip and Shannon: Undisputed"" to give his thoughts on the matchup. He proceeded to take a shot at LeBron James, saying he was bailed out by a role player following a poor performance:      ""I never thought I would see the night that somebody named Matt Ryan, and not that Matt Ryan, but the NBA\'s Matt Ryan, that that Matt Ryan would take LeBron off the hook for choking his guts out."" Bayless added: ""He was choking his guts out. Once again, right on cue. I keep telling you, LeBron does not have the closer gene."" In the 10 minutes he played in the fourth quarter of Wednesday\'s game against the Pelicans, James scored only four points and shot only 1 of 5 from the floor.     UNDISPUTED@undisputedMatt Ryan‚Äôs game-tying three led the Lakers to an OT win against the Pelicans: ""I fell out my chair. I never thought somebody named Matt Ryan would take LeBron off the hook for choking his guts out."" ‚Äî @RealSkipBayless14614 LeBron James and the LA Lakers are finally getting the help they need New Orleans Pelicans vs. LA Lakers.     Heading into this season, all the talk around the Lakers was that they put a cast of players around LeBron James who don\'t complement him. The All-Star forward is known for his high IQ and ability to find open shooters. Meanwhile, LA opened the year on track to become the worst 3-point shooting team in league history. Star players aren\'t going to have it every night. Which is why Skip Bayless shouldn\'t be judging LeBron\'s ability to close a game on a Wednesday night just three weeks into the season. Looking through history, there are plenty of examples of role players coming up big for stars. Most notably, when Michael Jordan found Steve Kerr for an open 3-pointer in the playoffs during their time with the Chicago Bulls. LeBron was having an off night, and his teammates managed to help bail out the team and steal the win. What stands out from this game is that the Lakers are finally getting help in a key area of need.For LeBron James to be at his best, he needs proper shooting around him. If Matt Ryan can continue to be a reliable shooter from deep, it will help the future Hall of Famer maximize his game.     ', '2022 NFL MVP award: 5 surprise candidates\xa0  Aaron Rodgers has been the standout performer in the NFL for the past two years, and the Green Bay Packers quarterback was selected as the league‚Äôs MVP for both seasons.  The expectation is that Rodgers will once again be in the conversation for the award for the upcoming season, irrespective of Davante Adams‚Äô departure to Las Vegas. However, there are a number of players who are going under the radar as possible outside candidates to be MVP in 2022.        Tom Brady‚Äôs return from his very brief retirement has opened up the MVP conversation even further, especially if he can convince Rob Gronkowski to return to Tampa Bay.           From a veteran in a new environment to a dominant defensive disrupter, there are some surprise contenders this year. Here is a look at five such surprise candidates to become MVP after the upcoming season.   #1. Matt Ryan The Indianapolis Colts expect Ryan to lead them to the playoffs Matt Ryan was named the NFL MVP for his performances in the 2016 season, when he carried the Atlanta Falcons to the Super Bowl.     Since that dramatic defeat to the New England Patriots, Matty Ice has seen his form with Atlanta dip as the quality of receivers around him dwindled. Taking inspiration from the Los Angeles Rams‚Äô success after pursuing a trade for Matthew Stafford, the Indianapolis Colts made an offseason move to bring Ryan in to be the actual replacement for Andrew Luck. Ryan is a veteran player who can throw the ball as well as anyone in the league. He has thrown for a minimum of 20 touchdowns in each of his NFL seasons, excluding his rookie year, and has thrown for over 4,500 yards in seven of his 14 professional seasons. Being in a new environment with an exciting offense could rejuvenate Ryan. If he quickly builds a connection with Michael Pittman JR, the former Falcon could string together another MVP-calibre year.  2. Matthew Stafford Matthew Stafford will be playing without pressure in 2022     Matthew Stafford was under pressure to deliver a Super Bowl championship to Los Angeles, with the Rams having traded for him as the final piece on what was an expensively assembled roster. In winning the title in the 2021 season, Stafford took a huge monkey off his back, and he can now simply focus on his individual performances. He produced magnificent throws in his first year with the Rams. But as the pressure to win in the playoffs mounted, the number of small mistakes he made increased. There will be no such pressure this season, with the Rams having a strong roster and a championship win under their belt. As such, Stafford will be able to play with freedom and utilise the offensive mind of Sean McVay.  The presence of receivers Cooper Kupp and Allen Robinson gives Stafford serious options. If he avoids injuries, it‚Äôs not unreasonable to expect him to put up MVP numbers in 2022.     Rams HQ üèà@RAMSHQNFLMatthew Stafford was the missing piece for a championship offense You do not win championships by doing 3-yard flats31824 3. Josh Allen Josh Allen has developed consistently since being drafted by Buffalo     Josh Allen‚Äôs NFL career with the Buffalo Bills has been an exciting story of consistent progression. In a city where NFL success has been so scarce, Allen has emerged as the saviour for Buffalo, taking the mantle of the great Jim Kelly on his shoulders. Allen‚Äôs best years came in 2020 and 2021, with him throwing near-identical 4,544 and 4,407 yards, with 37 and 36 touchdowns, respectively. With the Bills being the team with the most continuity coming out of the offseason, Allen knows his receiving corps should continue to get better. His performance against Kansas City in the playoffs was MVP-worthy on its own. If he can chain yet another consistent year, he can seriously elevate himself into a position where he is contending for the MVP award again.  4. Myles Garrett Myles Garrett would need a 20+ sack season to secure end of year honours     Only Alan Page and Lawrence Taylor have won the NFL MVP award as defensive players, and Taylor was the last to do so, as far back as 1986. It is incredibly difficult for a defensive player to win the award, simply because the league is now geared to quite incredible offensive numbers. JJ Watt made a case to win the award during his Houston Texans career. Aaron Donald has been sensational in the last two seasons but has fallen short of Aaron Rodgers. Now, it would take a superhuman effort for a defensive player to win the award, but in Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns, there is a generational pass rusher who could do just that. Garrett is heading into 2022 with his fitness issues resolved, and his 2021 season was his best in the NFL. He recorded 16 sacks and 33 solo tackles. If Garrett is going to be able to win the trophy, he is going to have to turn that 16 into 20+ sacks in 2022. But that isn‚Äôt at all unrealistic, given his incredible power and first-step.     Garrett has looked strong and sharp in the earliest pre-season workouts with the Browns, and that bodes well for his outside hopes of the MVP award.  5. Jonathan Taylor Jonathan Taylor is arguably the best running back in football Historically, if a quarterback doesn‚Äôt take home the NFL MVP award, then it is handed to a running back who has had a career year. Adrian Peterson was the last non-QB to take the MVP award back in 2012. But with Jonathan Taylor, the Colts have a player who is ready to breakout.     In 2021, he rushed for 1,811 yards in his second season in the league. His rookie year in 2020 saw him rush for 1,169 yards and he is still developing. PFF Fantasy Football@PFF_FantasyOnly players with 1,000+ rushing yards after contact last season Joe Mixon Jonathan Taylor(üì∏ @Bengals)3333242 Being behind a stronger offensive line and a better quarterback will help Taylor, although he may have to add some receiving options to his arsenal with Ryan in place. The belief that Taylor is due for a 2,000-yard season is shared within the Colts facility and amongst fans. Once you do that as a running back, you‚Äôre always going to be in the MVP discussion.

According to Dr. Tom House, there are ways to defy age.  Take Nolan Ryan as an example. The eight-time All-Star maintained his peak performance levels all the way until his retirement at the age of 46.        What about Tom Brady? American Football\'s Benjamin Button is still going strong at 45. It\'s no coincidence either that both Brady and Ryan were guided by the same guru.      Tom House, a former major league pitcher himself, turned into a sports science maverick after his playing days. He has earned several degrees since retiring, including a PhD in sports psychology. He has also contributed to several academic journals. House served as a pitching coach for several major league clubs, including the Astros, Padres and Rangers. He joined the Rangers in 1985, where he crossed paths with Nolan. Back in the day, an age of 35 or more was considered retirement territory for pitchers. When House joined the Rangers, Nolan was already 39 at the time. He went on to play at the very top level for seven more years, thanks to House‚Äôs unorthodox yet super-efficient methods. House went on to work with several quarterbacks in the NFL. His clientele includes the likes of Drew Brees, Dak Prescott, Matt Ryan and of course, the GOAT Brady himself. House recently discussed the parallels between the sensational, long-lasting careers of Ryan and Brady on ‚ÄúThe Rich Eisen Show.""     Rich Eisen Show@RichEisenShow‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason an athlete can‚Äôt do at age 45 what he did at age 25.‚ÄùFamed throwing coach @tomhouse told us how he started with Nolan Ryan and evolved to @TomBrady in helping athletes maintain peak performance into their 40s:#NFL #MLB7815 ""If you follow four basic principles -- biomechanics, functional strength, mental/emotional management and nutrition and sleep for recovery -- there\'s no reason an athlete can\'t do at age 45 what he did at age 25. We proved it."" - Tom House House recalled a conversation between him and New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. Apparently, Belichick strongly considered trading Brady after he had turned 36 before House talked sense into him. The rest is history.     ""By the time I got around to Tom Brady -- walking by Belichick\'s office one time when we had been out on the field throwing the football -- Belichick called us and said, \'Tell me why I shouldn\'t trade Tom Brady.\' At this time, I think Brady was 36, 37. I just said, \'Bill, the research shows that if Tom does what he\'s supposed to do‚Ä¶which he does to the tee, there\'s no reason he shouldn\'t play until he\'s 45.\' And here we are."" - Tom House Tom House was right on the mark with his Brady assessment Just as House had predicted, Brady defied time and helped the Patriots win three more Super Bowl titles before eventually leaving the franchise at age 42.     He went on to sign for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at 43-years-old, leading them to a Super Bowl triumph in his very first season.

', ""Jonathan Taylor injury update: Colts RB's return status and fantasy outlook for Sunday's NFL Week 11 game  Jonathan Taylor participated fully in practice on Thursday and Friday last week. He didn't carry an injury designation for the game last week against the Las Vegas Raiders. Taylor had missed three of the Indianapolis Colts' previous five games due to a sprained ankle that had subsequently gotten worse. Still, he was able to participate completely in training on consecutive days to finish Week 10 preparation, which seemed to put him in good health enough to start.  Jonathan Taylor's snap rate last week reached a season-high thanks to Nyheim Hines' absence. He put on his second-best performance of the year. It was the first time since the opening round of games that he finished among the top 20 running backs, earning him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.        Ari Meirov@MySportsUpdate2021 Jonathan Taylor is back. 3833269           Although the Philadelphia Eagles have been outstanding, Jonathan Taylor can still compete with them. Taylor should be able to return to the RB1 position. Managers should get him started. Jonathan Taylor's stats and fantasy prediction In the victory over the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday, Jonathan Taylor received both of his targets for 16 yards and also ran the ball on 22 occasions for 147 yards with a touchdown. Before the game, Jonathan Taylor was able to fully heal from the injuries that caused him to sit out three games over the previous five weeks. Taylor exceeded 100 running yards and into the end zone for the first time since Week 1, as he appeared to be in perfect health.     Brian Y@byysportsJonathan Taylor fantasy owners:36463 Matt Ryan, who started as a quarterback instead of Sam Ehlinger, probably helped prevent the Las Vegas defensive unit from filling the box against the run. Still, this week's opposition will be more difficult. In the past two games against the Houston Texans and the Washington Commanders, the Eagles have surrendered 320 yards and two scores on the ground. Last week, Taylor received 85.7% of the touches at running back for the Colts, rewarding his persistent fantasy owners. That was his second-best percentage of the year. Now that Jeff Saturday is the new head coach, Taylor looks much like the player you selected with the first overall choice at the start of the season.     Following the league's announcement, Taylor was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week on Wednesday morning. Tony Dungy@TonyDungyWhat did the Colts hope to get from when they named Jeff Saturday interim coach? Energy, unity and better O Line play. They got all 3 today. They battled back 3 times in the 2nd half. Ran for over 200 yds, only gave up one sack. Having Matt Ryan & Jonathan Taylor back helped3853283 In season 3, Taylor has had a difficult time. He has struggled with a bothersome ankle issue for the first time in his career, and the team's offense has been in disarray for most of the season.With Jeff Saturday as interim head coach, the Colts are looking to get back into playoff contention. If they want to achieve that, they'll need more performances like the last time from Taylor in the remaining games.     ""]"

He was the 26th overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft and while he looked great on his pro day, his football career has been a total disaster.                     Both Wilson and Lynch surprised many with incredible throws and athleticism in their Pro Days, which attracted NFL teams\' interest but they failed to play well when called upon. Lynch played just two seasons in the NFL for the Denver Broncos and hasn\'t been in the league since then. In those two seasons, Lynch played in five games, throwing for 792 yards with four touchdowns and four interceptions.

A few days ago, Paxton Lynch became the first quarterback in the history of football to be benched in the NFL, USFL, CFL, and the XFL after he got benched by the Orlando Guardians against the Houston Roughnecks.

Jones was rather efficient in the win, completing 23 of his 27 passes for 246 yards. The running game was solid enough with Damien Harris (8 carries, 65 yards) as the standout on the day.

Analysts have serious doubts about Will Levis' physique Will Levis: NFL Combine Will Levis played well during his time with Kentucky, but many have serious doubts about his chiseled physique. Both Colin Cowherd and Chris Simms have pointed out that not many muscular quarterbacks have performed well in the NFL, which is why Levis could have some difficulties in the future.     Although Levis plays similarly to Josh Allen, it will be difficult to anticipate whether he will perform similarly against superior athletes in the NFL. During his college career, he played 34 games for Penn State and Kentucky in which he threw for 5,876 yards for 46 touchdowns and 25 interceptions.As of now, Levis is projected to be a top-10 pick in the NFL Draft, and the Las Vegas Raiders seem like the best destination for him. Getting drafted by the Raiders will provide him time to develop under Jimmy Garoppolo, but it won't be a surprise if any other team also decides to pursue him.

He led the team to five wins, including a Week 9, 20-17 win against the Buffalo Bills. Under his leadership, the Jets lost two games, both of which were against the New England Patriots.  Wilson had a poor performance in the Week 11 defeat to their AFC East rival, and followed it up with a disastrous press conference. As a result, head coach Robert Saleh announced he was benching Wilson in favor of Mike White.        Wilson was roundly criticized for his refusal to take accountability for a poor offensive display, while the Jets defense limited the Patriots to three points all game. New England won the game 10-3 in the final seconds on a punt return touchdown.           In the postgame interview, a reporter asked Wilson if he felt he had let the defense down. His response was simple: ""No."" Watch the video below, as it was as much his body language as what he said:         So was it entirely that comment that led to his benching, or was there more to the story?

Although they were winning games, they were looking stagnant on offense and some of the issues had to be shouldered by Zach Wilson. It\'s important to note that a season-ending injury to Breece Hall was a major factor in their offensive downturn, but Wilson really didn\'t help himself either.     The Jets entered the regular season with Joe Flacco under center as Wilson suffered a knee injury in the preseason matchup with the Philadelphia Eagles. Flacco went 1-2 before Wilson was ready to play against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 4. Wilson brought the Jets into the limelight as they won their next four games. However, in Week 8, the Patriots defeated the Jets 22-17. Zach Wilson completed only 20 of the 41 passes he attempted. He threw for 355 yards and had two touchdown passes and three interceptions. Those turnovers proved too much for the Jets to overcome.        Following a narrow win over the Buffalo Bills and a bye week, the Jets fell to a disappointing 3-10 loss against the Patriots in Week 11. Wilson completed 9 of 22 passes for 77 yards and the offense gained just two yards after halftime.

It\'s been Justin Herbert, Josh Allen, and right now it\'s Joe Burrow. There\'s one constant in this debate: it\'s always someone vs. Mahomes.  Since Mahomes came into the league and became a starter, he\'s been the best quarterback. He won MVP that year and has only gotten better. It\'s a hot take to say anyone is better, but that didn\'t stop Carson Palmer.        On his brother\'s podcast, he dropped one of the hottest takes in recent memory:           ""I think Joe is the best quarterback in the league. I know Patrick [Mahomes] is phenomenal, but I just think Joe‚Äôs more consistent. He‚Äôs more consistent. He‚Äôs more accountable to run the system and the play that‚Äôs called and not feel like, \'Well, he didn‚Äôt win last time and get open for me, so I‚Äôm gonna do it with my feet,\' and then before you know it, you‚Äôre sacked for a four-yard loss because you tried to make two or three guys miss.""        He finished by saying: ""Joe is just... talk about not having a weakness. Mentally strong, physically tough, accurate, can throw it far enough, fast enough, gets the ball out quick, and then he can actually do a lot with his legs."" For a lot of reasons, this take is just wrong. Palmer is a former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback, so he is probably a little partial to the current Bengals quarterback, but if he\'s portending to be an analyst, some objectivity needs to be present.  There\'s no debate between Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes With all due respect to Joe Burrow, who is an elite quarterback, there is no comparison between the two. The accolades, numbers and performances all give the edge (sometimes a major edge) to Patrick Mahomes. The only thing Burrow has over Mahomes is a 3-1 record in their matchups, but the idea that a win belongs to the quarterback alone is absurd and should be dying out.     Patrick Mahomes winning Super Bowl MVP Even beyond that, Palmer\'s take has no substance. He tried to make it a deeper argument than the numbers by saying that Joe Burrow is consistent and has no flaws. He also added that he runs the plays in the system more often. If Burrow is a flawless quarterback, then there isn\'t a word to describe Mahomes. If Burrow is consistent, then so is Patrick Mahomes and he\'s consistently great. Burrow has gotten better each season in the league, but that doesn\'t make him consistently better than Mahomes, who started out winning MVP.        Furthermore, ""he\'s more accountable to run the system and the play that\'s called"" is just a poor take. The best quarterbacks are able to adjust, audible and make plays out of rhythm and out of design. Is Palmer saying Burrow doesn\'t do that? Yes, Mahomes does audible and make plays that weren\'t called. That\'s the mark of a good quarterback. The play call isn\'t the be all end all, which is the very reason audibles exist in the first place.     In Palmer\'s mind, Joe Burrow is going to get the play call in the huddle and go to the line and run it well. Mahomes, on the other hand, might do something else. Over his five seasons as a starter, he\'s earned the right to do that and has displayed the skill and IQ to do it well.    Palmer mentions that Burrow throws it far enough and is fast enough. He doesn\'t throw it as far as Patrick Mahomes, though. He\'s also a touch slower than Mahomes, who ran the 40 0.1 seconds faster and has a proven scrambling ability.Palmer\'s hot take is just that - hot. It appears to use substance and provide alternative ways of looking at the debate, but even those don\'t really hold water. By Palmer\'s own metrics, Patrick Mahomes is still a better quarterback. That\'s nothing against Burrow, though.

Dak Prescott struggles in Cowboys\' season opener Dak Prescott (under helmet) during the Cowboys\' season-opening game It was hard on the eyes and even harder for Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night. The Tampa Bay defense, led by Todd Bowles, made life very difficult for the Cowboys offense.        The game started brightly for Dallas as they drove down the field and scored what would be their only points of the game. After that, it was tough sledding for Dallas as their receivers simply could not get open. Prescott often forced the ball into tight coverage and was lucky not to be picked off more than once. The Buccaneers held Dallas to 3/15 on third down as the offense could not move the ball at all and kept the home side to 2/5 on fourth down. They also kept the Cowboys offense to just 3.8 yards per play.

Being the quarterback of America‚Äôs Team adds to any further fuss that the position already comes with. But no one had questioned the two-time Pro Bowler‚Äôs manhood or the way he played before. That changed when ESPN NFL analyst Dan Orlovsky discussed Prescott\'s performance against the Washington Football Team on the ESPN radio show Keyshawn, JWill and Max:  ""I\'m not saying that I\'m challenging his manhood, but he just looks like he\'s playing scared.‚Äù        The former NFL quarterback went on to say:           ‚ÄúAnd it\'s weird because that has always been a calling card of Dak.

After back-up Cooper Rush managed to secure a crucial win over the Vikings last week in Prescott\'s absence, the Cowboys\' No. 4 was back under center.  Dallas was a double-digit favorite as they welcomed the 4-4 Denver Broncos and many expected them to rack up points, as they have done all season.        From the get-go, it was evident that Dak Prescott and the Cowboys just were not at the races. Missed passes from Prescott, dropped passes from receivers and the defense\'s inability to stop anything the Broncos did on offense was hard to watch.           While the Broncos only mustered two sacks (both to Jonathon Cooper), Prescott was under duress for the majority of the game and his quarterback play mirrored a player who was under constant pressure. Bayless not pleased with Prescott\'s for poor showing Dak\'s poor play did not escape the eye of Fox Sports\' Undisputed co-host Skip Bayless. With Prescott scheduled to make an eye-watering $75 million this season, Bayless was so unimpressed with his quarterback\'s play that he took to Twitter to vent his frustration.

While the score describes a close game with just two scores between the sides (30-16), delving into the stats tells a story. The Broncos had more total yards (407 to 290), had more rushing yards (190 to 78), went at over 50 percent on third down and had total clock command, amassing 41 minutes and 12 seconds of possession time to the Cowboys just 18:48.

Retweeting it, Jimmy Johnson summed up Prescott\'s performance in two words:         ""A shame...,"" Johnson wrote.           Prescott wasn\'t bad, but he wasn\'t great either.

Like Romo, Prescott has only one playoff win in his first six seasons. By contrast, Troy Aikman had already won two Super Bowls by the time he entered the seventh year in the league.     When Jimmy Johnson was coach of the Dallas Cowboys in the 1990s, they won back-to-back Super Bowl titles and many considered his teams as the team of the 90s. Johnson\'s quarterback during that run was Fox NFL analyst and NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman. The Aikman and Jimmy Johnson combination was fierce. Ironically, the only team that ever challenged the Cowboys and kept them from winning three straight titles were the San Fransicio 49ers who were led by Steve Young. Jimmy Johnson and Aikman\'s relationship worked well because they both wanted the same thing and went about getting what they wanted the same way. Johnson was tough on his players and many wondered after the Cowboys\' loss on Sunday what his response would have been after this loss. Johnson would cut players for making those kinds of mistakes in football games. But his wasn\'t the only voice that was critical of the Cowboys on Sunday.     Jimmy Johnson not alone in his criticism Los Angeles Rams v New Orleans Saints Troy Aikman was also critical of the Cowboys\' play, calling on the offense in their loss to the 49ers saying this according to Sports Illustrated.

Joshua Dobbs was playing his first game for the Tennessee Titans after signing from the Detroit Lions\' practice squad. Sam Howell is the third-choice quarterback for the Commanders behind Carson Wentz and Taylor Heinicke.     Each of these should have been blowout wins. Instead, they now go into the postseason severely bloodied and winded. They are looking to win their first Super Bowl of the millennium and Prescott\'s performance today does not give much hope. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are a 8-9 team with a losing record and the Cowboys should be favorites. But they still have Tom Brady and the Dallas Cowboys are as weak as they could be in the quarterback position.It was the worst possible outcome to their final regular season game. They will hope that it will not have any bearing on the playoffs. They have flattered to deceive in the postseason previously, and they will now be hoping their luck flips.

', 'EXCLUSIVE: Dak Prescott\'s awful form could hand Buccaneers win vs. Cowboys, claims NFL insider  The Dallas Cowboys and Dak Prescott will play this week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers hoping to progress to the next round of the NFL playoffs. In theory, the Cowboys should be overwhelming favorites.  The Cowboys finished with a 12-5 season, whereas the only reason the Buccaneers are in the playoffs is because of a weak NFC South. With a 8-9 losing record, they would not have made it to the playoffs if they were playing in any other division.        However, it is the playoffs and anything can happen in a one-off game. The problem is compounded when one looks at the quarterback situation. Dallas has Dak Prescott, who was the league leader in interceptions this season. Tampa Bay has Tom Brady, whose ability to navigate the playoffs is legendary.           Speaking exclusively to Sportskeeda\'s ""The BallFather podcast"", NFL insider T.J. Rives also confirmed that it feels the same way in Tampa. ""You go back to that Washington game again a week ago where they were awful in the first half of that game, he was rattled for whatever reason by the Washington pass rush throwing bad passes. Can the Bucs front seven rattle Dak Prescott maybe even into an early turnover or two? Prescott ended up tied for the NFL in interceptions. And by the way, he became the first quarterback negative stat here.""     He highlighted Dak Prescott\'s awful performance in their last game against the Washington Commanders specifically and continued how badly he has played late in the season, in general. That he leads the interception stats despite missing five games this season could be a serious problem. ""... Prescott became the first quarterback in the history of the NFL\'s since the schedule expanded to 16 or 17 games to have 17 or more interceptions in a season where you missed at least five games. He missed five games, he threw 17 picks and a lot of them late in the year. So does Dak Prescott turn the ball over? That is enormous. And I think the bigger thing for the Buccaneers is play a clean game. If they are not turning the ball over, if they are not committing penalties to help the Cowboys out, they have a great chance to win, a great chance to win this game and move on.""

Here's a look at the injury suffered by the quarterback.  According to Pro Football Talk and The Athletic, team owner Jerry Jones said the quarterback had hyperextended his knee. After the injury, the owner quickly checked in with the sideline about his status. Of course, viewers know that he was good enough to finish the game.

67,Colin Kaepernick,"[""Colin Kaepernick's 5 greatest performances in the NFL  News has once again hit the NFL world that Colin Kaepernick is looking to make his way back into the league. He was recently seen working out for the Las Vegas Raiders. Kaepernick is one of the most controversial figures in the NFL due to his protests during the national anthem regarding racial inequality. What often gets lost in the discussion is his performance on the field as a quarterback.  Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterColin Kaepernick, who last played football in 2016, the same year he started kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice, is scheduled to work out this week for the Las Vegas Raiders, league sources told ESPN.More on NFL Live now.386835594        Drafted in the second round (36th overall) by the San Francisco 49ers, the quarterback had back-to-back 3000 yard passing seasons in 2013 and 2014 and led the 49ers to a Superbowl appearance in 2013. He was a dual threat quarterback who in many ways helped pave the way for the modern quarterback today.           Here are Colin Kaepernick's 5 best performances as an NFL quarterback.  #5 - NFC Divisional Playoffs, 2012, vs. Green Bay Packers Green Bay Packers v San Francisco 49ers Kaepernick always seemed to have Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers number. In this NFL playoff game, Kaepernick went 26-39 for 263 yards passing and two touchdowns as well as 181 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. The Packers had no answer for him on this day and it wouldn't be the last time the quarterback would break the hearts of Packers fans.      #4 - Week 1, 2013, vs. Green Bay Packers Green Bay Packers v San Francisco 49ers Starting off the season on the right foot is a bonus for every NFL team. For the two powerhouses contending in the NFC this week, one matchup was even more important. Last season's playoff defeat was still raw and revenge was on the cards for the Packers. Unfortunately for them, the 49ers quarterback kicked off his season in a dynamic way, throwing for 412 yards, the only 400 yard passing game of his career, throwing for three touchdowns in another victory over Green Bay.      #3 - 2013 NFC Wild Card Game, vs Green Bay Packers Green Bay Packers v San Francisco 49ers We swear this isn't a Kaepernick vs. Green Bay Packers list. Sometimes some players just rise up when the occasion calls, and Kaepernick always seems to raise his game against some of the NFL's best quarterbacks. The performance wasn't overwhelming stats-wise (227 yards passing, 98 rushing), but the result was one San Francisco fans will remember. Leading his team to victory, the quarterback drove down the field, resulting in a game-winning field goal with no time left on the clock.      #2 - NFC Championship Game, 2012 vs. Atlanta Falcons San Francisco 49ers v Atlanta Falcons The quarterback led the 49ers back to the Superbowl for the first time since the Steve Young era, winning 28-24 against the favored Atlanta Falcons. Down 17-0 early in the 2nd quarter, Kaepernick would not give up, throwing for 237 yards and a touchdown. Again, it wasn't a statistically noteworthy game for him, but his never-give-up attitude and leadership capabilties were on display for all of the NFL to see, particularly in such an important game.      #1 - Week 15, 2012 vs. New England Patriots New England Patriots v San Francisco 49ers Any time you get the chance to play against the best NFL quarterback of all time and beat him, it's a memorable game. Kaepernick threw four touchdown passes, going head-to-head with Tom Brady in a late-season game that set the tone for both the playoffs and the 49ers' eventual run to the Superbowl. Ian Rapoport@RapSheetFrom @NFLTotalAccess: Colin Kaepernick worked out for the #Raiders today. We take a look at various angles and what it means‚Ä¶54778After looking at these performances, it's hard to argue that the polarizing quarterback doesn't have what it takes. He may have been away too long to be a starter, but he could likely offer much to a franchise as a backup.

But what is rather interesting now that the news has been made public is Rihanna's interview with Vogue magazine back in 2019. In the interview, the singer was asked if she turned down the chance to perform at the 2019 Super Bowl because of her support for Colin Kaepernick, who previously took a knee to protest racial injustice and police brutality.

It was rumored that Taylor Swift could potentially be the headliner for the event, but the Saint Michael, Barbados native was chosen instead. At the time of writing, it is not known exactly who will be supporting the singer. Bad Bunny, J Balvin, Emme Mu√±iz, Travis Scott, Big Boi and Bruno Mars have complemented the headline act in recent years.

"", ""Who is most to blame for Colin Kaepernick never making an NFL return?  The NFL preseason is in full gear, and as has been the case since 2017, Colin Kaepernick is not on a roster. That fact would blow the mind of anyone watching the player a decade ago.  Yet, in the present, there are so many factors in play that make his absence an expected one. The problem is that there are multiple sides to the discussion. Fans may fall on different sides of the aisle when it comes to why he is not playing right now.        So who is truly to blame for Kaepernick, once again, not making an NFL return?           Colin Kaepernick is not in the NFL for one clear reason San Francisco 49ers v Los Angeles Rams NFL owners are why the quarterback has been kept off a roster since the 2017 season. By now, that should be a widely accepted viewpoint given just how long it has been. That, and the fact he and the league settled a collusion case way back in 2019.        Yet there are detractors who will point to the quarterback himself as to why he has been out of the NFL for so long. First, those with such a viewpoint could say his kneeling in 2016 is why he is in his current predicament. That, however, can be seen as too harsh. Those individuals could then shift and say his play on the field led to his ouster. He went 1-11 as a starter in 2016, but did have 16 touchdowns compared to four interceptions. The San Francisco 49ers were a mess that year, leading to a regime change featuring Kyle Shanahan in charge, who decided for a fresh start at quarterback. That openness led Kaepernick to opt out of his deal and become a free agent.     The only problem with the performance argument is that Kaepernick played fine given the circumstances. Also, we see so many quarterbacks perform poorly and still have a job the next season. Even if that job is as a backup. It is fair to note that he would likely have had a job if he was playing at an MVP level in 2016. A player like Lamar Jackson or Patrick Mahomes likely could have protested in the same way, still dealt with controversy, but kept a job moving forward. Talent usually wins out in the NFL. That is no secret.        There was just a perfect storm in place that allowed NFL owners to keep Kaepernick out of the league, and it's clear no coach or front office had a strong enough argument to bring him aboard.If there was no kneeling, this would not even be a story. Yet political tension was high in 2016. The quarterback, unfortunately, became a scapegoat for a movement that was peaceful in nature, yet it brought negative attention upon the NFL. When a player does that, it never ends well for them.     "", '""No reason why Cowboys shouldn\'t kick the tires on Colin Kaepernick"" - NFL fans urge Jerry Jones to sign QB after Dak Prescott\'s injury  Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys couldn\'t have gotten off to a worse start for the 2022 NFL season. They were defeated in Week 1 by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers by an embarrassing 19-3 score. They failed to put any points on the board, following their field goal on the opening drive of the game.  Prescott really struggled to get anything going against the Buccaneers defense, as the Cowboys offense was basically shut down completely. Dak Prescott completed less than 50 percent of his passes and threw an interception in a forgettable performance.        While the disastrous game alone would have been bad news for the Cowboys, things got much worse for them during the fourth quarter of the game. Dak Prescott injured his thumb and will reportedly require surgery to repair the damage to his throwing hand. He is projected to be out for, at least, the next six to eight weeks while he recovers from the unfortunate injury.               The Cowboys\' season and potential playoff hopes are now in serious jeopardy as Cooper Rush is currently lined up to be the starting quarterback for the Cowboys while Dak Prescott recovers from his thumb injury. Many rumors are circling that the Cowboys could now be in the market to acquire a temporary replacement quarterback, though their options appear to be relatively limited.     Many fans around the NFL have jumped on their social media accounts to offer possible solutions to the Cowboys quarterback situation. One of the names floating around is Colin Kaepernick, who has been attempting to make a comeback in the NFL for years now. Here are some of the top comments on Twitter about the possibility of the Cowboys signing Kaepernick as a short-term replacement. Cujoüí¨@cujoknowsThere\'s no reason why the Dallas Cowboys shouldn\'t kick the tires on Colin Kaepernick.245 M.G.@King1Nine@espn Last I heard, Kaepernick\'s hands are just fine.

They believe that he may give them a better chance of winning than the situation they are currently facing. They also pointed out that, if nothing else, it would be an interesting storyline to follow this year.         Who is Dak Prescott\'s backup QB for the Cowboys? Dallas Cowboys QB Cooper Rush Cooper Rush is currently slated to take over as the Cowboys\' starting quarterback while Dak Prescott recovers from his thumb injury. Rush has started one game in his career so far, when he helped the Dallas Cowboys defeat the Minnesota Vikings in a game during the 2021 NFL season. He completed 60 percent of his passes for 325 yards with two touchdowns and an interception in a solid effort.     ', '‚ÄúNFL analyst ranks Deshaun Watson controversy over Colin Kaepernick  Deshaun Watson and Colin Kaepernick are currently at the heart of one of the hottest disputes in the NFL today. The two quarterbacks currently find themselves in very different situations, which many people find outrageous.  While Kaepernick remains a polarizing figure for many fans following his protests on racial brutality and equality, Watson has found his way back to prominence in the NFL. The Cleveland Browns decided that his talent on the field outweighed the 22 pending civil lawsuits against him for sexual misconduct and offered him the largest guaranteed contract extension in NFL history.                     League officials recently met with the player as they near the conclusion of their internal investigation into the matter. Most analysts are more preoccupied with the question of how long the suspension will be for, rather than if there is one coming. The saga has been ongoing for more than a year and at least one NFL analyst believes it is the biggest issue in the league. The Issues at Heart: Colin Kaepernick and Deshaun Watson        Chris Simms appeared on NBC and gave his opinion on the matter. Here\'s what he said: ‚ÄúI\'m truly interested in this one just because, of course, it\'s Deshaun Watson... A troubling few years, whether it\'s true or not, there\'s definitely some shadyness. So why are you talking to so many masseuses? Anyways, there\'s some of that there, even if not guilty."" There has been a change in America after the #MeToo movement and the optics of this deal are bad for the league. Though he does not face a criminal conviction, the civil lawsuit is still pending and the volumes are staggering.     In relation to this, Simms went on to say: ""Then, of course, the huge contract that we\'ve discussed. It looks weird. The optics, as we discussed, when he first signed with the Cleveland Browns, hey, you\'re the biggest issue in the league right now. It really is. He\'s the biggest issue in the league. Hey, here\'s the greatest contract in the history of the NFL.‚Äù While Watson has the biggest guaranteed contract in NFL history, Kaepernick remains without a contract of any kind. Sharon Hummingbird (she/her/hers) üíôüíôüíôüíõüíõ@HummingBird57Deshaun Watson ‚Äúsigning him to a new five-year contract worth $230 million guaranteed, the most guaranteed money on a single contract in NFL history by $80 million‚Äù and Colin Kaepernick remains unsigned tells me all I need to know about @NFL2064473     While the NFL has stressed it supports racial solidarity in the wake of George Floyd\'s murder, Kaepernick is still without a team. While the NFL claims to support women, Watson gets a guaranteed $230,000,000. It is important to note that these statements do not necessarily correlate, but nethertheless, the contradiction is jarring. Many argue that Kaepernick\'s performance in his final few seasons for the San Francisco 49ers is what is keeping him out of the league. Others suggest that such a polarizing figure represents too great a fiscal risk to be signed by a franchise. Whether it is one or the other or a combination of both, Watson is surely now with him in the category of polarizing quarterbacks.In a nation where you are innocent until proven guilty, perhaps the Browns should have waited until the courts and the NFL reached their verdicts. Conjecture is all well and good, but the reality is this: one of these quarterbacks is without a job and the other is getting $230,000,000.     ', 'Shannon Sharpe doesn\'t believe Colin Kaepernick can perform at a high level in the NFL anymore  Colin Kaepernick will find it hard to pick up where he left off should an NFL team come calling, according to NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe. Kaepernick has not been sighted in the league since 2016 after taking a knee during the national anthem in protest against racial injustice and police brutality.  The free agent did have a workout with the Raiders and was said to have impressed them, but so far, no deal has come the 34-year-old\'s way.        Shannon Kelly@shannonkelly_tv""I\'ve loved my time with him, I think he\'s a great guy. He\'s been great to be around... competing against him"" Raiders QB Derek Carr gives his thoughts on the Raiders hosting Colin Kaepernick for a workout almost two weeks ago236           Shannon Sharpe believes that, even if Kaepernick does get a chance, it is going to be hard to play at the level required for the NFL simply because he has been out of the game for so long. Sharpe said: ""And so for me, it\'s just hard. I mean, people, you need to understand. Professional athletes normally do not get to sit around, do absolutely nothing in that profession, and just come back and pick back where they left off. Hell, even Michael Phelps, when he took that time off, he wasn\'t the same swimmer. And he only took off 16-18 months.""        Sharpe added: ""Imagine Michael Phelps taking off an entire Olympic calendar and Olympics and then coming back and saying, \'Okay, yeah, I\'m back in the pool. I\'m gonna pick right back where I left off. It doesn\'t work like that. Even the most skilled physician askew and professional, Skip, there are limitations."" Will Colin Kaepernick get another NFL chance?     Seattle Seahawks v San Francisco 49ers The workout with the Raiders was a step in the right direction, but as many pointed out, Las Vegas simply offered him the chance to workout. They didn\'t guarantee him a roster spot. After years of nothing from all 32 NFL teams, the Raiders have, at least, shown interest in the 34-year-old. Perhaps, that will have a flow-on effect and another team might invite him for a workout.        Derek Carr stated that he would welcome the franchise adding the former 49ers star and it would help the team as well. Kaepernick has been to a Super Bowl and NFC Championship games, so he knows what it takes to get to the penultimate game of the season. Tashan Reed@tashanreedDerek Carr said he knows Colin Kaepernick from their time playing in the same conference in college and endorsed the #Raiders giving him a workout.39934 However, as Sharpe stated, after being out of the game for so long, it will take time for the 34-year-old to get up to speed and teams simply might not want to wait.The Raiders took the first step, and although nothing came of it, could other teams follow suit and Kaepernick be back in the NFL? It doesn\'t seem as farfetched now.     ', 'Why did Colin Kaepernick kneel? Understanding the NFL player\'s protest against racial injustice  On September 1, 2016, Colin Kaepernick knelt before an NFL game in protest against racial injustice in the United States of America. That day will be enshrined in black history, as it heralded a much-needed change in a previously radio-silent NFL.  Kaepernick\'s protest was not the first of its kind in the US, but never before had a player taken such a risk in the extra-censored league that is the NFL. So, almost seven years later, the question remains, why did Colin Kaepernick kneel?        James Tate@JamesTate121This Super Bowl Sunday, lets remember why Colin Kaepernick took a knee. No matter how much Republicans want to erase it. #BlackHistoryMonth810232           Why did Colin Kaepernick kneel? Colin Kaepernick knelt so the modern civil rights movement could run, and the $126 million San Francisco 49ers QB decided to risk it all for a worthy cause. In 2016, USA was ravaged by numerous cases of racial injustice. The player did not mince words regarding his protests, and stated: ""It is to protest the injustices that are happening here, the oppression that is happening in America‚Äù.     Before Colin Kaepernick kneeled, there was no true form of protest in the National Football League. Of course, a couple of players made symbolic gestures that signified their dissatisfaction with the state of the country, but none on Kaepernick\'s magnitude. We should remember that he was a Super Bowl starting QB and the likely future cornerstone of the 49ers before he began protesting. ACLU@ACLUSome say football is no place for politics. They‚Äôre wrong.Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest unrelenting police violence against Black communities and was blacklisted because of it. Protesting athletes deserve better.To the players kneeling this season ‚Äî we‚Äôre with you.576112 What impact did Colin Kaepernick\'s kneel have against racial injustice?     In the immediate aftermath of Colin Kaepernick\'s Kneel, other National Football League players began kneeling and/or raising a fist as a sign of protest. As such, this caused a ripple effect throughout the NFL, American sports, and the entire nation. It finally became clear to the stakeholders that this wasn\'t an issue that could be trivialized and that the fight against racial injustice was finally national. As we know, the NFL is one of the most watched leagues in North America, so before long, regular citizens joined the protests. These protests weren\'t pleasing to the then-president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, as he never minced words on his displeasure. Kaepernick\'s kneeling helped the fight against racial injustice move forward, even though it likely cost him a spot in the NFL. Since January 1, 2017, the player has not played a single snap in the league, even though he has remained in great shape during his enforced layoff.     Yahoo Sports@YahooSportsThe only QBs to rush for 150 yards in a game in the Super Bowl era, you ask?Michael VickColin KaepernickLAMAR JACKSON4110 Was Colin Kaepernick a good NFL player? Yes, Colin Kaepernick was a solid NFL player, and was once one of the best dual-threat QBs in the entire league. He was known for being an amazing athlete and a more than competent enough passer. The San Francisco 49ers drafted him in the 2011 NFL Draft, and he took his spot behind Alex Smith on the depth chart. However, all he needed was a season on the bench to usurp starter Alex Smith from the San Francisco QB1 role.     He performed admirably as a starter for the 49ers, with the highlight of his NFL career being a Super Bowl XLVII appearance in a loss to the Baltimore Ravens. The 49ers might have lost, but Kaepernick gave a stellar account of himself with 302 yards passing performance. The rest of his NFL career was filled with ups and downs as he struggled to stay healthy for his last few seasons. Furthermore, his protests against racial injustice allegedly contributed to him being ousted from the NFL in 2016.Overall, Kaepernick was a solid NFL quarterback who could have had a longer and more iconic footballing career had it not been for some factors beyond his control.He finished his NFL career with 12,271 passing yards, 72 passing touchdowns, and 30 interceptions in 69 games. He also added 2,300 rushing yards and 13 rushing touchdowns on the ground.     ', 'Did Rihanna know about her pregnancy before accepting the Super Bowl halftime show?

', 'Colin Kaepernick may finally want to consider a stint in the XFL  Colin Kaepernick has spent months openly training for an NFL return. He has posted workout videos and even showed off his skills at Michigan, thanks to former San Francisco 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh. A workout with the Las Vegas Raiders was also conducted, but he remains a man without a team.  It is widely accepted that NFL owners colluded against the quarterback to keep him out of the league because of his kneeling protest in 2016. The 49ers released him after the season, and his simple act was enough to enrage the league enough to the point where no one signed him, not even as a backup.                     Kaepernick is 34 years old and had months to find a new team. Yet rosters have been filled, and it looks like he will not be given another chance. That means he can look elsewhere to continue his professional football career. The XFL remains his top option if the league can meet a few parameters. Colin Kaepernick was linked to the XFL before SPORTS ILLUSTRATED 2017 Sportsperson of the Year Show     The quarterback was in the same boat a few years ago, in 2020, when the XFL made its initial return. However, the league had a small salary structure that did not match what he wanted. It was nowhere close. That made sense for a new league, which folded anyway due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The league is set to return in 2023 with a new, high-profile ownership group led by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. The third iteration of the XFL can correct previous mistakes and even look towards someone like Kaepernick to be a big name on the field from the start. Most startup leagues are filled with NFL castoffs, so this would be a nice change. So how can they get him? That may require a salary commitment of nearly $10 million for the initial season. The question remains if that is even possible, considering most leagues of this kind have a uniform structure for all players because of the day-to-day financial constraints of a startup operation.     But let\'s say the league can give the player what he wants. Would he take the opportunity? It seems clear that Kaepernick does indeed want to play football again, and not just to make a political statement. He may, in fact, miss and love the game.    The new XFL, led by Johnson, has had time to study the new USFL and formulate a better plan than its predecessor. Its goal is to become a permanent spring league, and it is already set in terms of television partners. Getting Kaepernick would boost ratings from the start and make him an instant star.     A solid performance could convince NFL teams to give him another chance, or he may settle upon the idea of being the star of the XFL before getting a proper finale to his football career. If the price is right, the choice is his to make. And if he loves football, it seems like an easy decision. Why return to a league that did not want you and made it such a point to keep you out?

Hundley completed 16 of 23 passes for 236 yards, as well as passing for four touchdowns in the 38-10 victory. However, Hundley would never get close to a starting role in Green Bay, and has bounced around the league since.

However, this didn‚Äôt stop the Washington Commanders from giving Mack Brown 19 carries in a 2016 preseason outing against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

69,Drew Lock,"['Report reveals Browns player was unhappy with Baker Mayfield\'s poor performance in training  Baker Mayfield is currently facing a battle for his NFL future, which lies in limbo. He remains on the Cleveland Browns\' roster despite the franchise making it abundantly clear they will be moving forward with Deshaun Watson as their starting quarterback.  A recent report has questioned Mayfield\'s ability and that he was regularly poor in practice, according to an unnamed Browns player. The information contained a quote from a Browns player. The statement addresses a video Odell Beckham Jr.\'s father released on social media in November last year, showing the quarterback not throwing the ball to his son, who was open on several occasions.                View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post           According to the report, when asked if he had seen the video posted by Beckham Jr.\'s father, the unnamed Browns player gave a scathing response. He said: ""Why would I watch the video? I see it every day in practice."" Offseason Chopz@Pchopz_Oh boy.3417478     This is another negative view that could hinder Mayfield\'s search for a new team. With the NFL Draft ending, the chance for the Browns to move him on to pastures new and focus on the future with a different quarterback have also diminished. The Carolina Panthers were interested in Mayfield, but recent reports have shown that they were never close to a deal with the Browns. The Panthers went on to draft Matt Corral, who will challenge Sam Darnold for the starting job in Charlotte.        Other potential teams that needed a quarterback have made moves to find the piece to the puzzle, with the Pittsburgh Steelers drafting Kenny Pickett and the Seattle Seahawks set to move forward with Drew Lock behind center. Seattle head coach Pete Carroll recently stated that the Seahawks weren\'t looking to add another quarterback \'at all\' to their roster, which puts an end to Seattle being a possible destination for Mayfield.  Why are teams reluctant to make a trade for Baker Mayfield? One of the main hurdles is the quarterback\'s $19 million salary due in 2022. Teams seem reluctant to take on that amount, which reportedly led to the Panthers\' and Browns\' inability to agree on trade terms.   It also seems highly unlikely that Mayfield will stay and offer back-up for Watson as he sees himself as the starting quarterback. Based on the NFL Index quarterback rankings, he ranked 25th out of 62 quarterbacks, with his inconsistency proving to be a significant shortcoming.     ', ""Seattle Seahawks Free Agency news and signings  The Seattle Seahawks have been busy in free agency, securing key players for the upcoming season. They recently signed Pro Bowl quarterback Geno Smith to a three-year, $105 million contract and re-signed backup quarterback Drew Lock. The team also focused on improving its defense with several new additions.  Here's a breakdown of the Seahawks' key signings and their impact for the 2023 NFL season.                   Seahawks' free-agency signings so far  Geno Smith, quarterback The Seahawks secured their starting quarterback, Geno Smith, with a three-year contract worth up to $105 million. Smith's impressive 2022 season made him a priority. The Seahawks' commitment to Smith suggests they will focus on improving other areas, but drafting a quarterback in the future is not out of the question. OFFSZN Hawks üíôüíö@Geno4MVPI still don‚Äôt know how Geno Smith was able to throw this ball so perfectly142 Drew Lock, quarterback Seattle re-signed Drew Lock as Geno Smith's backup, appreciating his arm strength, mobility and potential. Lock's one-season deal, with a base value of $4 million, is reasonable for a backup with starting experience. The Seahawks may still draft a quarterback later, but Lock's signing suggests it's not their top priority.     Dre'Mont Jones, defensive dnd The Seahawks made a significant move by signing former Denver Broncos defensive end Dre'Mont Jones to a three-year deal. Jones has been a disruptive interior defender, and his addition addresses a pressing need. Although the deal is expensive, Jones' youth, skillset and production make it a worthwhile investment. 21-3@HackettSZN@MahomeSZN Dremont jones is his daddy3 Julian Love, safety Former New York Giants safety Julian Love joined the Seahawks on a two-year, $12 million deal. Love's signing raises questions about the future of Jamal Adams, who is recovering from surgery. However, Love's contract is more likely an insurance policy for Adams than a replacement.     Jarran Reed, defensive tackle Seattle brought back Jarran Reed on a two-year deal, adding a proven run-stuffer and interior pass-rusher to their defensive line. Reed's signing is a low-risk investment, given his consistent health and productivity throughout his career. Devin Bush, linebacker The Seahawks signed former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Devin Bush to a one-year deal, addressing their need for depth at the position. Although Bush's recent seasons have been inconsistent, his age and potential make this signing a low-risk proposition. Evan Brown, center Seattle signed center Evan Brown to a one-year, $2.25 million deal to address the need for a younger and bigger player in the position. Brown's signing provides a veteran option at center while leaving room for potential draft additions. Phil Haynes, guard The Seahawks re-signed Phil Haynes on a one-year deal worth up to $4 million. Haynes is expected to become a full-time starter, replacing veteran Gabe Jackson. This decision is a sensible move considering Haynes' age, health and recent performance.     Jason Myers, kicker Seattle re-signed Pro Bowl kicker Jason Myers to a four-year deal worth up to $22.6 million with incentives. Myers' new contract makes him the second-highest paid kicker in the NFL, reflecting his importance to the team. Seahawks' notable losses The Seattle Seahawks have experienced notable losses, including key players like Shelby Harris, Rashaad Penny, Gabe Jackson, L.J. Collier and Travis Homer. These departures leave a void the team must address to maintain its competitive edge.Shelby Harris was a versatile defensive lineman, and Rashaad Penny, a talented running back, both had a significant impact on the team. Gabe Jackson provided stability to the offensive line, while L.J. Collier and Travis Homer contributed to the team's defensive and offensive depth, respectively. The Seahawks will need to find suitable replacements to ensure continued success.     "", ""3 observations from Denver Broncos vs Seattle Seahawks  The Denver Broncos once again had a strong offensive showing in the preseason, winning 30-3 against the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday.  Perhaps the most important thing to happen over the course of the game was the fact that it became clear who should be the starting quarterback for the Broncos. If everything was pointing to the battle being very tight, Saturday's game made it clear that the competition has a winner.        On that note, here are three key observations after the Broncos-Seahawks game:           #1 It's Teddy's team If the quarterback battle was tight, Bridgewater's performance on Saturday all but helped him lock his spot as the Broncos' starter for week 1. With so much talent along the offense, Bridgewater doesn't really need to elevate the group so much but execute it well, and that's exactly what he's doing to show Vic Fangio that he should be the starter. Teddy Bridgewater‚Äôs preseason line to date:16-of-19 (84.2 pct.)179 yards9.42 YPA2 TD passes0 INTRating: 141.0Drive results:FGTDTDTDPoints per possession: 6.0 (!)‚Äî Andrew Mason (@MaseDenver) August 22, 2021     Bridgewater completed nine passes out of 11 attempts, threw a touchdown and seemed much more comfortable than Lock, his opponent for the starting job. He's also more experienced, and has at least proven himself capable of taking a team to the playoffs. When week 1 arrives, Bridgewater will be QB1.  #2 Seahawks' revamped pass rush makes this team a threat Denver Broncos vs Seattle Seahawks Seattle did a good job fixing one of the team's main weaknesses this past offseason, as the pass rush now can actually pressure opposing quarterbacks and not rely on Jamal Adams to do so.     Two sacks isn't a huge number by any means, but the pressure was there all night long, and both Teddy Bridgewater and Drew Lock had problems dealing with the Seahawks' defense. Yes, Denver's offensive line is not an amazing group, but they still would have won this matchup fairly easily last year. But not in 2021.  #3 Seahawks got what they paid for in the secondary Shaquil Griffin is not a superstar, but he's still a solid corner to play in the league, and he was the best cornerback in the Seahawks' roster over the last couple of years.

He suffered in coverage against Jerry Jeudy, and after four uninspiring years with the San Francisco 49ers, there's not much to be excited about with the prospect of him being the main cornerback for the Seattle Seahawks.     "", '5 strengths and weaknesses for the Denver Broncos heading into the 2021-2022 season\xa0  The Denver Broncos were the weakest team in the AFC West in 2020 and finished last with a 5-11 record. For as much promise as quarterback Drew Lock has shown over the years, he and the team fell short last season. There was also a game in late November 2020, when, due to COVID-19, the Broncos were left without a starting quarterback.  The Broncos now have a lingering quarterback competition in training camp. They also have other decisions to make before the 2021 NFL season officially begins. But what makes the Broncos good, and what is keeping them from showing their full potential?        5 Weaknesses for the Denver Broncos           #1 - Quarterback Situation The Broncos traded for Teddy Bridgewater from the Carolina Panthers this offseason. The Denver Broncos even seemed interested in trading for Aaron Rodgers from the Green Bay Packers but have made no progress on that front. The Broncos now have Bridgewater and Drew Lock. While Bridgewater brings experience and talent to the quarterback room, the Broncos could still acquire a quarterback before the season starts. But by trading for Bridgewater, the Broncos have shown that they lack confidence in Lock. But if Lock is named the starting quarterback after training camp, it will show that the team doesn\'t have much faith in Bridgewater. Either way, it will cause a distraction in training camp that may hinder the entire team. ICYMI: There‚Äôs one way Denver Broncos can be become the ‚Äúsleeping giant‚Äù immediately and it rests on the shoulders of the performance of QB Drew Lock. Here‚Äôs my story. https://t.co/MIceIkQEAz‚Äî Cameron Parker (@CamParkerPO) June 28, 2021     #2 - Offensive Line Garett Bolles had a shaky start to his NFL career due to injuries. The Broncos even declined the fifth-year option on Bolles\' contract before the 2020 season. But last season, he proved why the Broncos drafted him in the first round of the 2017 NFL draft and was an integral part of the offensive line. The team re-signed him to a four-year, $68 million contract extension this offseason.  The Broncos lost Ja\'wuan James to an offseason injury, and he was subsequently cut from the team. The Broncos did re-sign tackle Calvin Anderson, who played in two games last season. Regardless of which quarterback is under center, they are likely to have difficulty behind the Broncos\' offensive line.  #3 - Not Utilizing K.J. Hamler K.J. Hamler was a standout kick and punt returner as well as wide receiver at Penn State. Although he may have made the jump to the NFL a season too early, he was still highly rated in pre-draft projections and the Broncos drafted him in the second round.     Hamler was known as the ""human joystick"" for his ability to maneuver around opposing defenses and special teams. But the Broncos haven\'t used Hamler as well as they should have.  Diontae Spencer is the primary returner for the Broncos and is quite effective. But adding Hamler to the mix, with his speed and talent and on the offense, would add another dimension to it. #4 - Losing RB Phillip Lindsay Running back Phillip Lindsay made a splash in the NFL as an undrafted free agent in 2018, rushing for over 1,000 yards and nine touchdowns. In 2019, Lindsay rushed for over 1,000 yards again and seven touchdowns. In 2020, his production went down due to injury and he ran for just over 500 yards. The Broncos placed a restricted, right-of-first-refusal tender on Lindsay, but the two sides never agreed upon a contract extension, making him a free agent. He later signed with the Texans. Losing Lindsay and not adding another running back will hinder the Broncos\' offensive unit.     #5 - The inability to beat the Kansas City Chiefs The Broncos have lost 11-straight games against division rival Kansas City Chiefs. They haven\'t scored a victory over the Chiefs since 2015, although they were competitive and came close in 2020. To be competitive and be a contender in the AFC West, the Broncos need to find a way to get at least one win in their two games against the Chiefs. 5 Strengths for the Denver Broncos #1 - Secondary The Denver Broncos\' secondary is one of the best in the National Football League.  The team is stacked at the corner position. Last season Bryce Callahan, A.J. Bouye and Michael Ojemudia were three of the top outside corners in the league. Callahan will now move inside after the Broncos picked Patrick Surtain II in the first round of the 2021 NFL draft. The team also has Kareem Jackson and Justin Simmons, who are among the top two safeties in the NFL.     The Denver Broncos secondary sports 2 of the biggest ballhawks in the NFL pic.twitter.com/v4E6gMqCcJ‚Äî PFF (@PFF) June 9, 2020 #2 - The return of Von Miller Outside linebacker and one of the Broncos\' best pass rushers, Von Miller, missed the entire 2020 season with an ankle injury that he suffered in practice just before Week 1. Now that Miller is healthy once again, the Broncos will have that force off the edge they were missing in 2020. #3 - Drafting Patrick Surtain II Many Broncos fans were disappointed after the team drafted Patrick Surtain II in the first round with the ninth overall pick.     While some fans are still upset that the team passed on drafting a quarterback, the addition of Surtain to the roster gives the secondary another elite cornerback on the outside and makes the defense even more potent. Surtain could quickly become a fan favorite if he can perform at the same level that he did in college. #4 - WR Tim Patrick The 2020 season was a breakout season for wide receiver Tim Patrick. He surpassed all of his and the team\'s expectations.  In 15 games, he had 742 receiving yards and six touchdowns. Playing on a second-round tender for the 2021 season should motivate Patrick even more this upcoming season. #5 - Kicker Brandon McManus Like most NFL players, Brandon McManus had a few challenging stretches in 2020. In one game, he missed two of his four extra-point attempts. But since signing with the Denver Broncos in 2012, he has made 82.4% of field goals and 88.9% of his extra points attempts.In 2020, McManus made a career-long 58-yard field goal. He signed a four-year, $17.2 million contract extension last season.     ', ""NFL: 5 best replacements for Ben Roethlisberger at the Pittsburgh Steelers\xa0  Earlier during the offseason, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger restructured his contract to help with his team's cap situation.  In doing so, Roethlisberger also ensured he'll be returning to the fold in the Steel City come September 9th as the starting quarterback. But after 16 fantastic years in the NFL, it's hard to imagine that Roethlisberger has too many more championship-caliber years left in him.        Currently, Mason Rudolph is the Steelers' backup quarterback. If you happened to catch his 2019 performances when filling in for the injured Roethlisberger, then you'll already know they fell beneath the high standards expected in Pittsburgh.           The experience may have aided his progression. But, personally, I don't think Rudolph is the solution in the long term. This of course begs the question of who Roethlisberger's successor will eventually be? Let's take a look. Five potential replacements for Ben Roethlisberger The Steelers have signed Ben Roethlisberger to a new contract, per @RapSheet 24th highest-graded QB in 2020 (69.0) pic.twitter.com/DQMUUJ4mEK‚Äî PFF (@PFF) March 4, 2021     #1 - Marcus Mariota (Las Vegas Raiders) Marcus Mariota 2014 Heisman Award-winning QB Marcus Mariota has struggled to live up to expectations in his NFL career. In Tennessee, his abilities seemed to wane year on year and it was no surprise to see him moved on to the Las Vegas Raiders during the 2020 offseason. Mariota has been back up to Derek Carr ever since. That being said, there are two reasons why this signing could work for the Steelers. First, Mariota is out of contract at the end of the 2021 season and has enough experience under his belt to come in and do a job and second, in the one-game viewers really got to see off Mariota last season, he performed quite well.         This performance does suggest that coach Gruden's influence on one of the best college players of all time has been paying off. Besides which, if all else fails, Mariota can simply keep the passing game simple and hand the ball off to Najee Harris, who looks destined to have a tremendous career in the NFL. #2 - Carson Strong (Nevada)        Of all the quarterbacks I've seen this week in preparation for next year's 2022 NFL draft, the Nevada Wolf Pack's signal-caller Carson Strong is certainly the closest to Roethlisberger's style of play. He is potentially a college talent that the Steelers will keep an eye on. Like Roethlisberger, Strong is a traditional pocket-passer blessed with a gun of an arm, accurate delivery, and, at 6-foot-4, a real presence behind the line. Of course, the Steelers could vouch for a host of other quarterbacks in next year's draft. But with 5,193 yards, 38 TDs and just 11 picks in his first two campaigns as a starter in Nevada, Mike Tomlin and co. could do a lot worse than Carson Strong in their quest to replace Roethlisberger. #3 - Drew Lock or Teddy Bridgewater (Denver Broncos) Denver Broncos v Atlanta Falcons     With Drew Lock now vying with the former-Panther, Teddy Bridgewater, for quarterback supremacy in Denver. One of the two signal-callers will likely be deemed surplus to requirements come the 2022 offseason. Teddy Bridgewater threw for 3,733 passing yards, 15 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for Carolina in 2020. Drew Lock managed 2,933 passing yards, 16 touchdowns and 15 picks for the Broncos. With those stats, neither player is likely to pacify a Steelers fanbase used to watching such talents as Terry Bradshaw and Ben Roethlisberger at Heinz Field. But both would be decent stop-gap options if coach Tomlin and GM Kevin Colbert feel there isn't value for them in the 2022 NFL draft. #4 - Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers) Aaron Rodgers is reportedly not happy with the Packers and he has told the organization he does not want to return to the team, per @AdamSchefter Rodgers: PFF's highest-graded player in 2020 (95.1) pic.twitter.com/xTHVEAlZBF‚Äî PFF (@PFF) April 29, 2021     Aaron Rodgers wants out of Green Bay. The Pittsburgh Steelers franchise is one of the most renowned and storied in sports. If the quarterback is granted his wish, I'd expect to see the Steelers sniffing around for the 2020 NFL MVP and the quarterback reciprocating the interest. It probably won't happen, but the Steelers have as good a chance as any other team of persuading Rodgers to join their ranks and, of course, he'd be an excellent replacement for Roethlisberger. #5 - Mitchell Trubisky (Buffalo Bills) Mitchell Trubisky: 63.5 PFF Grade in 2020T-32nd among QBs pic.twitter.com/6eOYBFqsJ6‚Äî PFF (@PFF) March 18, 2021     Bear with me here. For all the hate he receives for not being Patrick Mahomes, Mitchell Trubisky has still thrown almost twice as many touchdowns as he has interceptions in his short career. He's been to the playoffs twice and he's young enough to improve further whilst learning a more dynamic style of offense under Sean McDermott and Brian Daboll at the Bills training center. And who knows what kind of tricks he'll pick up from Josh Allen over in Buffalo, too. Like my first pick Marcus Mariota, I just don't think Trubisky is over and done with in the NFL just yet. Someone will give him another opportunity, so why not the Steelers next year if Roethlisberger retires?Trubisky lining up alongside RB Najee Harris, WRs JuJu Smith-Schuster, Chase Claypool and Diontae Johnson doesn't sound all that bad to me.Plus, it's not like Roethlisberger didn't have a nightmare season back in 2006 (18 touchdowns, 23 interceptions). Players can improve, and Trubisky deserves another shot.     Also Read: Who is Ben Roethlisberger's Wife, Ashley Harlan?

The New York Jets went into the off-season with many question marks about their head coaching job and quarterback. New York hired the former San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh. With one of the two questions answered, the Jets then traded Sam Darnold to the Carolina Panthers.        The Jets then selected former BYU quarterback Zach Wilson with the second overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft.

Week 10: vs. Buffalo Bills Prediction: L 45-21 They say, ""when it rains, it pours,"" which will fit the Jets perfectly this season.

', 'Top 10 traded NFL players to watch in training camp in 2021  Nearly two dozen NFL players were traded this off-season, and several have been finalized as we enter training camp.   Some big names like Julio Jones, Orlando Brown Jr, Jared Goff and Matthew Stafford were shipped off to new cities. Just because a player is traded doesn\'t guarantee a starting position or even a roster spot, though.         Here are the top ten players that were traded ahead of NFL training camp who deserve some attention, whether it is for a position battle or how they adapt to a new team.            #1 - WR Julio Jones Trade - Falcons trades Julio Jones and 2023 sixth-round pick to Titans for 2022 second-round and 2023 fourth round. A.J. Brown and Julio Jones will be a special duo pic.twitter.com/bNBF9V6BYS‚Äî PFF Fantasy Football (@PFF_Fantasy) July 7, 2021 It wasn\'t much of a surprise when Julio Jones was traded. The Tennessee Titans got a major upgrade at WR even though they weren\'t huge favorites to get him.      Jones is already making an impression with his new team, helping coach up younger receivers like AJ Brown at training camp. Everyone feels Julio Jones could make an immediate impact on the Titans, but there is still the lingering question of how his hamstring would hold up in the training camp and beyond.  There haven\'t been any complications yet, but there haven\'t been any live practices or games yet with training camps fast approaching. Watch out for his overall health and how he performs in the upcoming training camp for his team.  #2 QB Teddy Bridgewater Trade - Panthers traded Teddy Bridgewater to Broncos for a 2021 sixth-round pick.

Despite having the best year of his career, the Panthers traded for Sam Darnold, and they weren\'t going to have a backup QB making $21 million a year.  The Denver Broncos took on Bridgewater and re-signed him on a one-year, $11.5 million contract. Denver wanted Bridgewater to either push Drew Lock or to outright win the starting role.  Instead, there is a heated QB training camp battle between the two, and it seems to be anyone\'s to win. Watch the Denver QB battle and see if Teddy Bridgewater\'s experience gives him the edge in training camp.  #3 QB Sam Darnold Trade - Jets traded Sam Darnold and a 2021 sixth-round pick to the Panthers for a second and fourth-round pick in 2022. The reports are looking up for Darnold in Carolina.https://t.co/45CgEUHdyV‚Äî Carolina Panthers (@Panthers) July 6, 2021     The New York Jets held the second overall pick in the draft, and Sam Darnold clearly had no future left in New York. He went to Carolina and kicked out Teddy Bridgewater.  The Panthers already love what they see from Darnold in training camp and feel their roster could help turn the young QB\'s career around. There\'s an actual backfield with true talent and a decent group of receivers. Watch out for Sam Darnold to build connections with his playmakers and protectors during training camp, and watch his on-field confidence come pre-season.  #4 QB Matthew Stafford Trade - Lions traded Matthew Stafford to Rams for 2022 and 2023 first-round picks, 2021 third-round pick and Jared Goff.

Everyone in the NFL, whether a Lions fan or not, was happy to see Matthew Stafford get out of Detroit, where his career was stalling.  The Rams became an instant favorite to make the playoffs after the trade, and Stafford is a contender for the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award. Watch out for how Matthew Stafford handles big-market media and what the offense looks like with a fresh QB during training camp.  #5 OG Gabe Jackson Trade - Raiders traded Gabe Jackson to Seahawks for a 2021 fifth-round pick. San Francisco 49ers vs Oakland Raiders     We all know how unhappy QB Russell Wilson was last year with his offensive line\'s poor pass blocking.  Jackson was rated the 16th-best guard by the PFF last season and will come in to help open up the run game further and keep Wilson on his feet. Watch out for improvements on the OL with Jackson and if he can teach the other linemen some tricks in training camp.  #6 - TE Josh Oliver Trade - Jaguars traded Josh Oliver to Ravens for a conditional 2022 seventh-round pick. Jacksonville Jaguars vs Indianapolis Colts     Surprisingly, Josh Oliver is becoming one of the hottest names on this list. Oliver hasn\'t played much in the last two seasons due to injury but is possibly going to bump some players off the roster.  His coaches are raving about his untapped potential as a pass-catcher, and he could even usurp Nick Boyle as TE2 during training camp. Watch out for Oliver\'s continuing growth in Baltimore in training camp and how he is used in their multi-TE sets.   #7 - OT Trent Brown Trade - Raiders traded Trent Brown and 2022 seventh-round pick to Patriots for 2022 fifth-round pick.

He was part of a soft rebuild that helped the team win Super Bowl LIII.  Brown was the highest-paid OL back in 2019, with a four-year, $66 million deal. His performance dipped after he went to the Raiders and got a new deal as he also dealt with lingering health issues. Watch out for Trent Brown to act like he never left in training camp and help turn around the Patriots once more.   #8 - QB Carson Wentz Trade - Eagles traded Carson Wentz to Colts for a 2021 third-round pick and 2022 conditional second-round pick. #Colts QB Carson Wentz has brought all the offensive skill players to Houston, Texas for pre-training camp workouts üëÄüëÄ (via @Mike_Playmaker‚Äôs Instagram): pic.twitter.com/5ObHmarFp1‚Äî Locked On Colts Podcast (@LockedOnColts) July 6, 2021     The Colts have been running with veteran QB rentals rather than taking a young rookie in the draft.  Carson Wentz was benched last year by the Eagles due to his turnovers and poor pocket vision. Phillip Rivers had a nice final run with the Colts, but Carson Wentz is just 28.  Don\'t assume Wentz will be a long-term solution in Indianapolis or be able to fix his turnover issues in just a year. He could have a rough training camp this year. Watch out for how he commands himself in the pocket in training camp and if a change of scenery turns out to be good for him or not.  #9 - C Rodney Hudson Trade - Raiders traded Rodney Hudson and a 2021 seventh-round pick to the Cardinals for a 2021 third-round pick.

That changes at center, as they have the No. 1 overall player. https://t.co/durT4Oz0B2‚Äî TheCardsWire (@Cards_Wire) June 30, 2021     In 2019, Hudson became the highest-paid center in the NFL. He ended 2020 as the seventh-highest graded center on PFF and goes into this year as the best center in the league.  Kyler Murray was only sacked 27 times last year but is still a mobile QB, and his OL needs to help protect him so he can get a pass to their amazing playmakers. Watch out for Hudson, as he could be a huge improvement from Mason Cole last year and help the OL have a strong training camp.  #10 - DE Michael Brockers Trade - Rams traded Michael Brockers to Lions for the 2023 seventh-round pick.

The disastrous first NFL start of Jake Fromm (17) is another embarrassing wrinkle to the Giants\' lost season (Photo: Getty)     #31 - New York Giants (4-11) Last Week: 34-10 L @ Philadelphia Top Performer: CB Logan Ryan (6 tackles, 2 pass breakups) This Week: Sunday @ Chicago (1 p.m. ET, CBS) Not only have the Giants looked progressively worse, there\'s apparently no plan to deviate from this horrifying new normal: all signs point to the team retaining head coach Joe Judge and franchise quarterback Daniel Jones.

The draft order has been set with the Jacksonville Jaguars owning the first overall pick for the second straight year. One major storyline from the 2022 NFL Draft is the lack of star quarterbacks in the draft class.  Many believe we won't see a quarterback taken within the first ten picks, something that hasn't occurred since 2013 (one of the weakest QB draft classes in the last decade). Kenny Pickett, Malik Willis, and Matt Corral all have the potential to be the first quarterback off the board, but Corral has been consistently climbing the rankings over the last few months.        Matt Corral: Potential 1st QB taken in 2022 NFL Draft           Chick-fil-A Kickoff - Louisville v Ole Miss The bulk of Corral's career at Ole Miss didn't start until 2020, his second season as a starter for the Rebels. After facing mental health difficulties and his troubled past, he was able to get in the right mindset and thrive under his new head coach, Lane Kiffin. In 2019 Corral posted a 59% completion rate of 1,362 passing yards, throwing for six touchdowns and three interceptions. Corral upped the ante in 2020 with a career-high 70.9% completion rate, 3,337 yards, 29 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. In his final year in college, he threw for 3,343 yards on 20 touchdowns and rushed for an additional 11 scores.     Mark Tyler(Hogs Haven)@Tiller56Matt Corral - toughest QB in college football.12:36 PM ¬∑ Feb 12, 2022171Matt Corral - toughest QB in college football. https://t.co/Oi0A3XfI12 A quick scouting report on the 23-year-old signal caller would suggest that his upside comes in the form of his arm strength and pocket mobility. Whereas Corral's points of concern have primarily been around his small frame and the slow pace at which he goes through his progressions. Nevertheless, Corral is still an NFL-ready quarterback but one who is best suited to sit as a rookie and take some time to adjust to the pros. With a bounty of quarterback-needy franchises in the draft, here are five teams that should put Matt Corral high on their draft board.     #1 - Washington Commanders have a new NFL brand and need a new NFL quarterback to match Washington Football Team QB Taylor Heinicke Nothing against Taylor Heinicke, but he has seemingly reached his limit in the league as a starter. He's good enough to pull off sneaky comeback victories and take his team to the playoffs in a weak division. But Heinicke is not the guy to take Washington deep into the postseason or lead the franchise longterm.     Damien Bartonek üá®üáø@DABartonekTaylor Heinicke (& Washington, for that matter) ran the 3rd most Play-Action concepts last year among qualified starters. 34% of Heinicke‚Äôs drop-backs involved PA, via PFF. Last season, over 60% of Matt Corral‚Äôs drop-backs involved PA.4:33 AM ¬∑ Feb 20, 202232Taylor Heinicke (& Washington, for that matter) ran the 3rd most Play-Action concepts last year among qualified starters. 34% of Heinicke‚Äôs drop-backs involved PA, via PFF. Last season, over 60% of Matt Corral‚Äôs drop-backs involved PA. On the other hand, Washington's scheme aligns well with Corral's playing style, he has the potential to thrive running a rather simple offense with a strong emphasis on RPOs. Offensive coordinator Scott Turner can help guide Corral as he acclimatizes to the league, while also working on sharpening the tools of the young quarterback. The newly-rebranded Commanders have a strong run game that would aid a rookie quarterback, as well as a star receiver in Terry McLaurin, to make the passing game easier. Adding some more offensive skill players in free agency could certainly turn this team around.     #2 - Denver Broncos have a top NFL roster without a top quarterback Denver Broncos v Los Angeles Chargers - QB Drew Lock The Denver Broncos are filled with talent on both sides of the ball, but their talent is being wasted without a quality quarterback under center. Neither Teddy Bridgewater nor Drew Lock is the future of this NFL franchise. New head coach Nathaniel Hackett has worked closely with reigning NFL MVP quarterback Aaron Rodgers and could work his magic on Corral next.

Appealing for any QB that might be looking for a new home. twitter.com/RapSheet/statu‚Ä¶ Denver has a much better roster compared to Washington but would likely have to trade up to land Corral, as they are slated to pick ninth in this year's draft. If the Broncos do indeed draft him, the offense around Corrall would be just as young and as hungry as he is. Which could see the team making a statement in 2022 or 2023 as the Cincinnati Bengals did in 2021. #3 - New Orleans Saints need to start one quarterback in 2022 instead of four different ones     New Orleans Saints QBs - #15 Trevor Siemian and #7 Taysom Hill The New Orleans Saints started four different quarterbacks in 2021 and still couldn't find a long-term answer at the position. Jameis Winston started the season as the #1 quarterback but suffered a torn ACL as well as an injured MCL. Trevor Siemian had a decent run as a starter but showed once again that he is better suited to being an NFL backup. Taysom Hill remains an all-purpose athlete with no sole purpose on the roster and Ian Book floundered in his sole start as a rookie. Matt Corral could be the answer to solving the quarterback issues in New Orleans.     PFF Bet@PFF_BetMatt Corral is (+900) to be the next quarterback of the New Orleans Saints (@bookies)2:30 AM ¬∑ Feb 19, 202292386Matt Corral is (+900) to be the next quarterback of the New Orleans Saints üëÄ(@bookies) https://t.co/rpThSVTptF Despite not having Sean Payton as the head coach anymore, the Saints offer a great defense and a solid offensive line when they are on the field. The franchise has suffered a lot of turmoil as of late and needs to start building around one quarterback, not two or three. Jameis Winston could be brought back on a cheap one-year deal to start in 2022 as Corral learns the ropes behind him. #4 - Philadelphia Eagles have too much draft capital to not take Matt Corral     NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Philadelphia Eagles v Tampa Bay Buccaneers - QB Jalen Hurts The Philadelphia Eagles have three picks in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft: #15, #16, and #19. Quarterback Jalen Hurts played admirably across 15 games, passing for 3,144 yards on 16 touchdowns and nine interceptions. This was in addition to 784 rushing yards for a further 10 touchdowns. Hurts simply doesn't look like he's on his way to becoming a dominant passer in the league and was barely able to get his team above .500 (they finished 9-8) Miles Banders@ThatboylightMatt Corral your future Philadelphia Eagles quarterback ü§ù8:02 AM ¬∑ Oct 24, 2021177Matt Corral your future Philadelphia Eagles quarterback ü§ù https://t.co/67tFFpez1b     Philadelphia has major needs such as an edge-rusher, safety, and receiver and could use their first two picks to attempt to address those issues. But passing on several of the best quarterbacks in the draft class twice isn't ideal when you don't have a promising future with your current quarterback. Corral is also a dual-threat quarterback but possesses a slightly better arm than Hurts. The NFC East is in the midst of a power shift and the Eagles could capitalize in a big way with an upgrade at quarterback. #5 - New York Giants take Corral in a heart beat if he falls to Round 2 in NFL Draft Philadelphia Eagles v New York Giants - #8 QB Daniel Jones     There is no guarantee that Matt Corral will get drafted in the first round. Following the NFL Combine, Pro Days and interviews, there's a chance he could go unpicked throughout the first round. His limited leadership experience and ball security issues could easily see him slide down into the second round. If he is still on the board, then the New York Giants should pull the trigger at pick No.36. Owen Kidd@OKiddVTWhat I‚Äôve read about Matt Corral: He has the tools to be a Lamar Jackson/Trey Lance/Josh Allen-type quarterback but he's still incredibly raw and will likely need some time to grow into the starting role at the next level. Would you still want to draft him high 1st round?6:31 AM ¬∑ Oct 25, 202131What I‚Äôve read about Matt Corral: He has the tools to be a Lamar Jackson/Trey Lance/Josh Allen-type quarterback but he's still incredibly raw and will likely need some time to grow into the starting role at the next level. Would you still want to draft him high 1st round? New head coach Brian Daboll did wonders with Josh Allen in Buffalo and Corral has been compared to Allen in terms of his mobility and arm strength. Daboll hasn't committed to Daniel Jones and may want to bring in some strong competition to test the limits of his current starter. The scheme fits and Corral is too good to pass on should he fall to the second round, despite his flaws.

While the Broncos have played a few competitive games against some of the league‚Äôs best teams this season, they were crushed by the Buffalo Bills last Saturday by a final score of 48-19. Not much went right for them in that game, but prized free agent RB acquisition Melvin Gordon reached the end zone twice in that contest to make the score a little bit more respectable.

Even without a banner performance from WR Keenan Allen, who was nursing a hamstring injury, QB Justin Herbert was able to make it work with other complementary offensive players.  TE Hunter Henry scored his 4th touchdown of the season against the Raiders, and may be relied on heavily if Allen is not able to suit up for the Broncos tilt.

Broncos QB Drew Lock has shown signs of promise, and has a deep receiving corps that is developing along with the second-year passer.  WR‚Äôs Tim Patrick, Jerry Jeudy and K.J. Hamler all have the potential to explode any given week, and considering their familiarity with the Chargers, it‚Äôs a good bet that one or two of those players score this week. Herbert played well enough to win the game in Week 8, and given his steady play over most of the season, figures to excel against Denver in round two. His game-winning quarterback sneak against the Raiders was a building block for his confidence, which should extend into this game, and give Los Angeles a slight edge in this contest.Prediction: Chargers 28, Broncos 27     ']"

NFL Free Agency: Signing Ryan Fitzpatrick keeps Washington Football Team as contenders in the NFC East There\'s no question that Washington fans should doubt Ryan Fitzpatrick\'s age and performance deterioration since entering the NFL in 2005, but he was likely the best free-agent QB left on the market and did not require the team to give up so much in a trade. Known as ""Fitzmagic"" around the league by fans, he has spent his time with eight different teams in the league after being drafted by the then St. Louis Rams in 2005. The 38-year-old QB has played for the Cincinnati Bengals, Buffalo Bills, Tennessee Titans, Houston Texans, New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Miami Dolphins.     In the 2020 NFL regular season, Fitzpatrick played in 9 games and started in 7 games, before rookie QB Tua Tagoviloa was named the starting QB in Week 8. In those 9 games, Fitzpatrick completed 183 of 267 passes for 2,091 yards with 13 touchdowns and 8 interceptions.

Washington Football Team fans should not worry as Ryan Fitzpatrick could be a great option as a bridge QB to a much younger player that the team potentially may draft. GM Martin Mayhew and OC Scott Turner attended Trey Lance\'s pro day and he could be one of few QB\'s that may fall to the 19th position in the upcoming NFL draft.Either way Ryan Fitzpatrick is not the long-term solution and the organization is looking at each season one by one, considering they can keep that stellar defense for only so long. Washington Football Team will still be an NFC playoff contender this coming season and fans should be excited.     ', 'Tom Brady vs Ryan Fitzpatrick beef: Retracing infamous feud between ex-NFL QBs  The feud between quarterbacks Tom Brady and Ryan Fitzpatrick is bizarre.  It‚Äôs easier to comprehend the bad blood between Brady and Peyton Manning because they were equal rivals during their prime. However, their rivalry was purely performance-based, and they had the utmost respect for each other.        Apparently, Brady did not go along with Fitzpatrick, a quarterback who played for nine NFL teams in 17 seasons. Likewise, Fitzpatrick defeated Brady only three times in 14 meetings. No wonder some football fans claim the tension between them was a publicity stunt.           But before jumping to a conclusion, it‚Äôs best to reminisce about the incidents that provoked a rift between the two play-callers with lengthy careers. When did the Tom Brady-Ryan Fitzpatrick beef start? Brady reminisced about his 2020 free agency journey in a 2021 episode of HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Shop: Uninterrupted.‚Äù Teams reached out to him because he was already a six-time Super Bowl winner, with the most recent one happening in 2018. When the conversation went to the teams who were not interested at the very end, Brady revealed his thoughts by saying: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sticking with that m*th*rf*cker. Are you serious?‚Äù        Fitzpatrick felt he was being referred to because the Miami Dolphins (his team back then) reached out to the Michigan alumnus. The Harvard graduate was penciled in as the Dolphins‚Äô starting quarterback unless Brady joined them. Eventually, Tom Brady joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and won his seventh Super Bowl title. Meanwhile, the Dolphins drafted Tua Tagovailoa with the fifth overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft. Despite Tagovailoa‚Äôs arrival, Fitzpatrick started seven games that year and unleashed his ‚ÄúFitzmagic‚Äù to save some games in the fourth quarter.     Further investigation revealed that Dolphins vice chairman Bruce Beal had contacted Brady as early as August 2019. It violated the league‚Äôs anti-tampering policy, as Brady was still under contract with New England. That case and the Dolphins‚Äô communication with coach Sean Payton led to the forfeiture of their 2023 first-round pick. Ryan Fitzpatrick says one thing, Tom Brady says another A year later, Fitzpatrick still couldn‚Äôt ignore Tom Brady‚Äôs alleged comment about him. That‚Äôs why he was still irked about the three-time NFL MVP during his September 2022 guesting in Barstool Sports‚Äô ""Pardon My Take"" podcast. When PFT Commenter suggested that Brady was referring to Derek Carr in the infamous quote, Fitzpatrick reacted: ‚ÄúNo, it had to be me.‚Äù But when Dan ‚ÄúBig Cat‚Äù Katz suggested that Tom Brady had the utmost respect for him, Fitzpatrick answered: ‚ÄúNo, zero respect. He never shaked my hand. I‚Äôve told this story before, but it just p*sses me off because you‚Äôre in Buffalo, you‚Äôre playing them in there, and they‚Äôre kicking our a*s every single year. They‚Äôre beating us.     ‚ÄúAnd then, in 2011, we finally knocked them off. It was right at the beginning of the season, we had like this great start, and he threw five interceptions in the game, which was just wonderful to see, every single one of them. ""And he ran straight off with no handshake, you know quarterback, middle of the field, for the cameras, ‚ÄòStay healthy, buddy‚Äô, you know. Pat me on the head and let me go. ‚ÄúBut he just ran straight off. So, it bothered me so much because there was no respect there. So it was like, every time I played him after that, I was like, ‚ÄòAll right, let‚Äôs at least make this dude respect me.‚Äô‚Äù        Not long after, Tom Brady responded to Fitzpatrick‚Äôs statements on the ""Let‚Äôs Go! Podcast"" hosted by himself, Larry Fitzgerald, and Jim Gray. Brady said: ‚ÄúI like to keep them guessing. Unfortunately, with this coming out, I‚Äôd have to tell him it wasn‚Äôt him. I love Ryan, but somehow, he‚Äôs got it out for me. ""I actually talked to Ryan Griffin, who‚Äôs one of our quarterbacks (on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers), and he said, ‚ÄòRyan‚Äôs always all over you. I don‚Äôt know why.‚Äô So, I don‚Äôt know why Ryan is. Maybe Ryan and I need to have a talk.     ‚ÄúRyan‚Äôs a hell of a guy too, and I‚Äôve competed against him.

Unless you\'re a Patriots fan.     From the first kick-off to the final kneel-down in victory formation, the Bills were in total control. They became the first team in NFL history to score on their first seven possessions and did not punt, kick a field goal or turn the ball over. Bills quarterback Josh Allen dismantled the Patriots defense in the air, throwing for five touchdowns and 308 yards.

The ""Fitz-magic"" era is now in the past, with the league losing one of its most charismatic players, who illustrated that increasing age didn‚Äôt have to equate to a downturn in performances.        The journeyman quarterback was loved wherever he went, even if he never quite had the ability to be an elite signal caller in the NFL. This is shown by the fact that he represented 9 teams throughout his time in the league.           His reliability and strength of character attracted teams to him as a backup option, yet invariably he would win-out and emerge as the starter at multiple teams. Field Yates@FieldYatesRyan Fitzpatrick served as the starting QB for 9 different teams in his career, the most of any player in NFL history.BengalsBillsBuccaneers CommandersDolphinsJetsRamsTexansTitans1143111 Fitzpatrick ended his career with a lengthy text message to teammates, with the Washington Commanders being his final destination before riding off into the sunset.     In appreciation of the popular quarterback, we have ranked his time in the NFL by his performances with each of the franchises he represented. #9 ‚Äì Washington Commanders (0W 1L) Los Angeles Chargers v Washington Football Team It is somewhat upsetting that the worst period of Fitzpatrick‚Äôs career will be the last memory we have of him. He signed a one-year deal with Washington to be the team\'s starter and he held that role until his first game with the team. He was injured during the second quarter and didn\'t return. Unfortunately, the injury would result in him missing the entire season. Unless he changes his mind on retirement, it is the last we will see of the veteran quarterback on the field.     Not only did his Washington career stand at a single defeat, Fitzpatrick completed just three of six attempted passes, was sacked once and fumbled the ball once. #8 ‚Äì St. Louis Rams (0W 3L)  St. Louis Rams 2005 Headshots The St. Louis Rams (now Los Angeles) drafted Fitzpatrick all the way back in 2005, yet he wasn‚Äôt the answer for the team at quarterback. In two seasons with the struggling team, he was able to start just three games, all of which came in his rookie year.     He threw for 777 yards and four touchdowns and couldn‚Äôt find a rhythm and was an immediate target for defenses. His ball retention skills were poor, he was sacked nine times and he fumbled the ball on three occasions. He had eight interceptions during his time with the Rams. NFL Throwback@nflthrowback The original Fitzmagic Playing in the first game of his @NFL career, Ryan Fitzpatrick guided the @RamsNFL back from a 21-point halftime deficit by tossing 3 TDs, including a 56-yard game-winner in overtime.

He won three, lost six and threw for 2,454 yards. Interceptions were still an issue as he racked up 12 on the year, but he did at least throw 14 touchdown passes. In one season with the Tennesee Titans, he was sacked 21 times and he fumbled the ball 9 times. Whilst he had rebuilt his reputation with the Buffalo Bills before signing with Tennessee, his spell with the Titans showcased some of his worst football. #6 ‚Äì Cincinnati Bengals (4W 7L 1T) Detroit Lions v Cincinnati Bengals     As a seventh-round draft selection, it is unusual for a team to trade for you after you fail to succeed initially. However, Ryan Fitzpatrick was given a shot by the Cincinnati Bengals after the Rams decided to trade him, and it was a mixed experience. He didn‚Äôt play a single game in 2007 due to being a backup to Carson Palmer, but when injury struck the starter in the 2008 season, Fitzpatrick had his chance. He ranked third in rushing for quarterbacks in the 2008 season with 304 yards, although this was way before the emergence of modern, mobile playmakers.

He had become the archetypal backup quarterback in the NFL and was being paid as such. In his debut season with the Dolphins, Fitzpatrick started 13 games. He had a record of 5-8 that year and threw for 3,529 yards, 20 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. These aren‚Äôt elite numbers, but he was able to keep the Dolphins team competitive whilst producing moments of extreme excitement in games.

After the disappointments in St. Louis and Cincinnati, he would spend four seasons in Buffalo, including the final two where he was the guaranteed starter and played every game. In three of his four years in Buffalo, he threw for at least 23 touchdowns and 3,000 yards. Fumbles and sacks were still a problem, but on a poor team it was Fitzpatrick who stood out. His 98-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens in 2009 is a franchise record and it‚Äôs fair to say this period built Fitzpatrick\'s reputation.

He had an even record of six wins and six losses, throwing for 2,483 yards and 17 touchdowns. He made history for the Texans in a 2014 game against the Titans, throwing a franchise-record six touchdown passes in a single game, a record that still stands to this day.

Once again, fate would shine on the player who seemed born to be a backup. A pre-season punch from a defensive lineman to Geno Smith left the starter with a broken jaw and all of a sudden the former seventh-round pick was the Jets‚Äô biggest hope. His 2015 season was historic as he gained his first winning record, leading the Jets to a 10-6 season.     He threw for 3,905 yards, the closest he would ever get to the 4,000-yard mark, but his 31 touchdown passes that season remain a franchise record, something the great Joe Namath never managed. Just two days after thumb surgery, Fitzpatrick would still play in a game against the Jaguars, throwing two touchdown passes. The overtime game-winning drive against the New England Patriots was a particular highlight. Fitzpatrick elevated himself to a bona-fide NFL starter, but his second year in New York fell flat, despite signing a guaranteed $12 million contract. Irrespective of that, his first year with the Jets was a player at his absolute best, who had extracted the absolute most out of the talent he had been given, and it‚Äôs the season that we will all remember the most when thinking of Ryan Fitzpatrick. brandon@JetsHateMeThe last Jets quarterback to beat the Patriots is now retired‚Ä¶.

Jimmy Garoppolo has been under plenty of scrutiny throughout his career. Many wonder if he is, in fact, the long-term answer for the San Francisco 49ers.  Those thoughts were exaggerated even more when the 49ers drafted Trey Lance in the 2020 NFL Draft. Lance went on to turn heads throughout the preseason and is often being showcased as a much better prospect than other rookie quarterbacks.        After the 49ers played an intense game, losing to the Green Bay Packers in the final seconds of Sunday night's game, the question remains: is Jimmy Garoppolo the answer at quarterback?           Is Trey Lance a better option than Jimmy Garoppolo? Jimmy Garoppolo hasn't exactly played badly in the first three weeks of NFL action, but the idea now is should he remain the starter? The 49ers could very well go the route that the Miami Dolphins took in 2020 when Ryan Fitzpatrick was benched in favor of rookie Tua Tagovailoa. Tua went on to have a 6-3 record last season under center. Trey Lance may have more upside than Tua. The only way to truly find out would be to bench Garoppolo. The standing rumors are that the 49ers may make that change somewhere in Week 6 or 7 of this season. The 49ers are currently 2-1 and in third place in the NFC West. Should they lose another game, they may be trailing far behind the undefeated Arizona Cardinals and Los Angeles Rams.     NFL on CBS üèà@NFLonCBSHighest on-target throw % in NFL:1. Mac Jones 90.9%2.

Garoppolo currently has 257 yards with 2 TDs and 1 INT. His 64 attempts on 95 attempts give a 67.4% completion percentage. He also has a 101.2 passer rating with these numbers. Garoppolo's numbers in completion percentage, total yards, and passer rating have him hovering around the middle mark for all active quarterbacks. That could be the reasoning behind the rumors surrounding Trey Lance starting at some point this season.     The issue with Garoppolo is his need or want to throw the ball downfield more than he currently has. Garoppolo's longest pass is for 79 yards, which is quite good. However, his 8 yards per attempt is his total average. It's a stat that most quarterbacks will want to improve upon. Garoppolo needs to have more confidence in throwing the long ball, or he might not be able to. His mobility could still be in question after a lackluster 2020 campaign due to lingering injuries.

Miami Dolphins rookie quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was benched mid-game for the second time this season during an unsteady performance against the Las Vegas Raiders.  The first time Dolphins coach Brian Flores benched Tagovailoa for performance reasons was during a Week 11 loss to the Denver Broncos. Tua was 11 for 20 for 83 yards and a touchdown before getting replaced with Ryan Fitzpatrick.         With 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter against the Raiders, the Dolphins were trailing 16-13. Flores was not satisfied with his rookie QB's play, benching Tagovailoa and replacing him with veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Miami's opening day starter -- under center.            Up to that point, Tagovailoa was 17 of 22 for 94 yards with a touchdown and no interceptions. He'd been sacked three times and rushed for 11 yards.

Former New England Patriots quarterback Ryan Mallett was a talented backup in the National Football League (NFL). The alumnus of Michigan and Arkansas University served as a valuable asset for the Patriots, Houston Texans, and Baltimore Ravens during his seven-year NFL career.  Mallett accumulated a decent amount as a backup quarterback in the NFL. We will delve into his career earnings he achieved throughout his time in the league. So, without further ado, let's explore the impressive earnings of the late stellar QB.        New England Patriots@PatriotsThe New England Patriots are deeply saddened to learn of the sudden and unexpected passing of former quarterback Ryan Mallett.Our thoughts are with the Mallett family, his former teammates and all who are mourning his loss.168252328           How much did Ryan Mallett in the NFL? Ryan Mallett made $9,516,798 in his seven-year spell as a quarterback in the National Football League. The talented shot caller started his career with New England Patriots after being drafted to play backup to the GOAT, Tom Brady. Mallett was paid $2,170,852 for his time in New England. Mallett left New England in 2014 to take up a new challenge in Houston with the Texans. He was equally decent as a second-string QB on a decent Texans team. Mallett earned $3,714,476 in his two-year stint with the Texans.     He left the Texans in 2015 when he joined the Baltimore Ravens. It was Ryan Mallett's last NFL assignment, and he earned $3,631,470 for his efforts. Mallett left the league 2017 with $9,516,798 in his bank account. Suitable for a career backup QB. Pat McAfee@PatMcAfeeShowThe NFL community lost a legend..Rest Easy Ryan Mallett  #PMSLive2703248 Ryan Mallett's NFL Career Timeline Ryan Mallett had a stellar college career with the Michigan Wolverines and the Arkansas Razorbacks. He was a two-time Second-team All-SEC honoree. His college football performances got him selected in the third round of the 2011 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots.     Mallett started and ended his Patriots' career as the primary backup to Tom Brady. He was inactive for 15 out of 16 regular season games and every post-season game for the Patriots' Super Bowl run. The rest of his time with the Patriots went by similarly. Tom Brady was never injured, so Mallett could only take snaps in garbage time. The New England Patriots traded Mallett to the Houston Texans in 2014 for a conditional sixth-round pick. He spent his time in Houston backing up the likes of Ryan Fitzpatrick and Brian Hoyer. The Texans released him in the middle of the 2015 season due to off-the-field reasons. Later in the 2015 season, the Baltimore Ravens elected to take a chance with Mallett and signed him to a contract. He had the best spell with the Ravens, throwing for career-highs numerous times. He stayed with the Ravens till the end of the 2017 NFL season and eventually exited the league. His overall NFL stat line was 1,835 passing yards, nine passing touchdowns, ten interceptions, and one rushing touchdown in twenty-one games.     "", ""Which team would be the perfect fit for Cam Newton?  Cam Newton's stint with the New England Patriots came to a surprising end as the quarterback was released to reach the 53-man roster limit.  Newton was the Patriots' starting quarterback for the 2020 season and entered a battle with rookie Mac Jones for the job in the pre-season, which Jones definitely won today with the veteran's release. The 2015 NFL MVP made some good appearances in the pre-season, but New England decided to focus on the future and give Jones the most snaps he can take as a rookie.        It's also worth noting that even though Newton seems to be healthier than 2020, Jones gives the Patriots the best chance to win in 2021.           There wasn't just one reason that Cam Newton is gone. It was a combination of at least three, I'm told: Mac Jones' emergence, Newton's vaccination stance (which caused a bit of a stir behind the scenes) and Cam's uninspiring performance this summer.‚Äî Adam Beasley (@AdamHBeasley) August 31, 2021 However, a question arises with Newton's release: which team would be the best fit for the veteran in 2021? Washington Football Team the most logic spot for Newton With the regular season only nine days away, there aren't a lot of spots that make sense for Newton to be in. Washington is the outlier in that sense.     Connections with coach Ron Rivera, who drafted and coached Newton for the Carolina Panthers from 2011 to 2019, made it a possibility when the veteran first became a free agent in March 2020. A deal was never reached because Washington had Dwayne Haskins on the roster and they focused on developing the young quarterback, but things went south from there. The situation is different now, as Newton knows he'll have to settle for a backup role if he wants to play in 2021. Ryan Fitzpatrick, Washington's starter, has been kind of a journeyman during his career, and we can never discard the possibility of Fitzpatrick being benched. Super Bowl 50 - Carolina Panthers v Denver Broncos     If Newton joins Washington, he'll be on a team where the backup position is valuable and, if something happens to Fitzpatrick, whether he gets injured or is benched for a poor performance, Newton would play for a team that gives him an opportunity to compete for a playoff spot. A couple of factors in play with releasing Cam Newton rather than keeping him on as the Patriots' backup: His command of the locker room, and his vaccination status. Neither make him an ideal choice as a backup behind a rookie QB.‚Äî Doug Kyed (@DougKyed) August 31, 2021 Newton needs to settle for a backup role With the regular season only a few days away, Newton won't be the presumed starter for any team, even those with a murky quarterback situation.     This is not a position like offensive lineman or kickers, where it doesn't take much to learn the system and you can just go out and perform. Quarterbacks are the most important pieces on a team and it always takes some time to learn the playbook.That's why Washington is the best landing spot for Newton. He's already familiar with the coaching staff. He'll have a shot at playing during the season, considering who their starter is.But if the veteran thinks he'll be able to find a starting spot in the league, even after a decent pre-season, he's setting himself up for disappointment.

Geno Smith is all the rage after his performance for the Seattle Seahawks against the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday Night Football.

We look at the journey that has led him to this place and all the other teams he has played for. Teams Geno Smith played for before the Seattle Seahawks Geno Smith began his career at the New York Jets or, as is otherwise known, the graveyard of promising quarterbacks coming out of college. He was drafted in the second round of the 2013 NFL draft after impressing in West Virginia, where he led the Mountaineers to multiple bowl games in his college career.     In his rookie season, Smith competed with Mark Sanchez for the QB role, before being named the starter after Sanchez suffered a shoulder injury. He struggled throughout the season but showed improvement when the Jets won three out of their final four games. It was enough for him to be named starter for the 2014 season. His 2014 was a minor improvement on his rookie season. Prior to the 2015 season, he was involved in an altercation with teammate IK Enemkpali, that led to him fracturing his jaw. In his absence, Ryan Fitzpatrick took over and led the New York Jets to a 2-0 record, thereby taking Geno Smith's position as a starter.  Smith remained the backup throughout 2015 and 2016, and when he finally got his chance in the latter, he tore his ACL, which ruled him out for the remainder of that season.  In 2017, Geno Smith signed with the New York Giants, where his most noteworthy contribution was being named starter against the Oakland Raiders, which broke Eli Manning's 210-game streak as the starting quarterback. He could not impress in the game, however, and was benched the very next week.     He played the 2018 season with the Los Angeles Chargers and appeared mostly in relief roles. He featured in a total of five games during the season. Geno@GenoSmith3Love this team! Love this city! Winning is all that matters.

71,Davis Mills,"['5 players who have surpassed expectations so far in 2021 NFL season ft. Ja\'Marr Chase  Every player entered the 2021 NFL season with a certain level of expectation. They were based on several factors such as past performance and team situation. Some players have surpassed them while others have struggled to meet them. Here are five players who have exceeded expectations in the 2021 NFL season.  Exceeding expectations in the 2021 NFL season        #5 - QB Davis Mills, Houston Texans           Davis Mills was drafted by the Houston Texans as a prospect for a possible role in the future. He was never supposed to be a starter in the 2021 NFL season, but circumstances forced him into the position. Deshaun Watson is dealing with issues off the field and his replacement, Tyrod Taylor, was injured early in the 2021 NFL season. Rivers McCown@riversmccownDavid Culley on Davis Mills/QB: ""It\'s extremely important for the entire football team, you know, to know that when you go out there that particular guy is going to do his job ... I feel like, in Davis, we have a guy like that, that in the future could be that kind of guy.""12:14 PM ¬∑ Oct 27, 2021151 All things considered, Davis Mills has done a good job filling in as a starting quarterback sooner than expected. He has statistically held his own with five other rookie quarterbacks who were all drafted in the first round, while he was selected in the fourth.     #4 - CB Trevon Diggs, Dallas Cowboys Trevon Diggs showed great potential in his 2020 rookie season. He got better as the season progressed and recorded three interceptions over his last five games. He entered the 2021 NFL season with expectations of being a solid cornerback, but he has taken things to the next level.

He is three interceptions clear of second place. He has also scored two defensive touchdowns this season and is an early candidate for Defensive Player of the Year.     Exceeding expectations in the 2021 NFL season #3 - RB Ezekiel Elliot, Dallas Cowboys The 2021 NFL season has seen a revival of Ezekiel Elliot. He had the worst season of his career in 2020 by almost every measure. The short lifespan of running backs made many believe that his best days were long behind him and that he had become just an average player.

He ranks fifth in rushing yards, tenth in yards per carry and third in rushing touchdowns. Zeke is not done yet.     #2 - WR/RB Cordarrelle Patterson, Atlanta Falcons Cordarrelle Patterson was one of the biggest surprises of the 2021 NFL season. He has done it all for the Falcons this season, leading the team in rushing yards, rushing touchdowns and receiving touchdowns while also ranking second in receiving yards and third in receptions. He is also their primary kick returner. He is now 30 years old, and is having the best season of his career. He has been a utility player in recent seasons but hasn\'t featured in any offenses. New head coach Arthur Smith has figured out a way to utilize his skillset. #1 - WR Ja\'Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals Ja\'Marr Chase and quarterback Joe Burrow had elite chemistry when they played together in college at LSU. The Bengals drafted Chase in an attempt to recreate that. Expectations were high for Chase during the 2021 NFL season, but he has far surpassed them.

Quarterbacking one of the most overlooked franchises in the NFL isn't easy, with every defeat further knocking a fragile confidence.  The Houston Texans finished the 2022 season with an almost inexplicable victory over the Indianapolis Colts. It was a win that cost them the first-overall pick in the 2023 draft. While the Chicago Bears were doubtless the real winners of that crazy AFC South showdown, Davis Mills may also benefit.        The Bears will likely trade the number-one pick for as much as they can get, as they will almost certainly go forward with Justin Fields under center. The Texans, however, are looking to the draft for a new quarterback. While Houston could send draft capital to Chicago for pole position, this feels unlikely.           As does trading for Lamar Jackson or Aaron Rodgers and going for Jimmy Garoppolo doesn't make total sense. These are targets for teams that are looking to win now and the Texans are rebuilding. Drew@IndepthTexansThe Houston Texans have now met with all of the 4 top QB‚Äôs in the NFL Draft:‚Ä¢Bryce Young ‚Ä¢C.J Stroud ‚Ä¢Anthony Richardson ‚Ä¢Will LevisVery likely one of these 4 will be the Texans next QB and or selection with the number 2 overall pick in the draft23322     Whoever does get the first-overall pick is expected to take Bryce Young, which suggests CJ Stroud will become a Texan. Regardless of which QB they draft, this is bad news for Davis Mills. However, he may yet get another chance to prove himself. Bringing in a rookie QB is highly unlikely to turn Houston into immediate Super Bowl contenders, for there are needs to address throughout their roster. With a new head coach and plenty of decent picks, they will be an interesting team to watch. But chucking a rookie quarterback into the fray could do more harm than good. Blooding the rookies throughout their rebuilding roster will be a must, but being careful with their biggest investment is key. Mills was sacked 31 times in each of his two campaigns, and the franchise will test its offensive line before throwing a new man into the mix. The Texans would be wise to tread carefully with their rookie's confidence. There's a fine line between learning from your mistakes and developing a complex. Many a QB has been ruined by a losing side and Houston will measure their new man's mettle carefully.        As such, don't be surprised if the Texans take their time introducing a new man under center and we may see Mills start the season. There is certainly precedence for patience with rookies, as seen by multiple quarterbacks currently in the league.  Rookie quarterbacks often sit behind veterans Los Angeles Rams v New York Giants     Obviously, not every player will see the success of Patrick Mahomes, who sat behind Alex Smith for his first campaign. Nor will the new Texans QB necessarily turn into Aaron Rodgers, who was Brett Favre's understudy (not exactly willingly by either player) for years. Kenny Pickett had to wait for his chance behind Mitch Trubisky for the Pittsburgh Steelers, as did Malik Willis and Desmond Ridder (Tennessee Titans and Atlanta Falcons, respectively). Jared Goff didn't make an appearance for the Los Angeles Rams until the franchise lost patience with Case Keenum midway through the 2016 season. Trey Lance also sat a season behind Jimmy Garoppolo. The point here is that there is a good chance Houston will give Davis Mills opportunities this season. They may want to let their rookie find his feet in the NFL before naming him the starter, or ensure his head doesn't drop if things go wrong. Looking at the last two seasons, Davis Mills is well worth keeping around for the Texans, especially on his rookie deal.      Davis Mills might not resurrect the Texans, but he can help them through a transitional phase Davis Mills - Philadelphia Eagles v Houston Texans Houston have struggled for multiple seasons, with their last playoff appearance coming in the 2019 campaign. Deshaun Watson recorded an individually memorable 2020 campaign, but the Texans finished 4-12. With Watson sitting out a season before being traded to Cleveland, Houston had a gap to fill at quarterback.     Davis Mills was drafted by the franchise in the third round in 2021 behind several quarterbacks. This list includes Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson, Trey Lance, Justin Fields, Mac Jones, Kyle Trask, and Kellen Mond. Mills was taken 67th and not a whole lot was expected of him or the Texans. In his rookie season, he was something of a surprise package. Mills started the campaign behind Tyrod Taylor before taking the starting role (after an injury and some poor play by Taylor). Mills threw for a respectable 2,664 yards and 16 touchdowns against 10 interceptions. He went for a disappointing 2-9 as a starter, but given how low expectations were for him and the Texans, Mills was given quite a lot of credit. In the last campaign, Davis Mills threw for 3,118 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. There were concerns with his play and analysts were reluctant to give him a pass this time. Talks that maybe Mills could be the man under center long-term stopped, and as the losses piled up, people started to look to the 2023 draft.     That said, Mills had some decent highlights last season, especially in both games against the Colts. Quarterbacking the Texans was a thankless task in the 2022 campaign, and it could have gone a lot worse. # 2 Pick In Draft@AYOTexanNationSome Big boy throws from Davis Mills week 1 vs Colts ! 23-37 / 240 Yards/ 2TD 0ints / 98.9 PRLeft some plays out there but all in all had a solid game #WeAreTexans17729 Davis Mills could be very useful in getting the Texans through a transitional phase (as they look to go from early draft pickers to AFC South contenders). He's a cost-effective, willing, and serviceable option while the Texans prepare their new man for life in the NFL.His performances certainly weren't awful and with his future on the line (along with a better roster), it's possible that he will improve markedly in the 2023 campaign.     "", ""3 observations from the Houston Texans-Dallas Cowboys preseason matchup  The Dallas Cowboys are still searching for their first win of the preseason after a disappointing loss to the Houston Texans Saturday night. Jerry Jones' boys have one more shot against the Jacksonville Jaguars next week, and that game has now become more critical.  Unlike the Cowboys, the Houston Texans are heading into their preseason finale undefeated. With everything the Texans have gone through this offseason, finishing their preseason undefeated will be a massive win. The Texans may not be a dumpster fire after all.        Here are three observations from the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans' Week 2 preseason matchup.            Houston Texans rookie QB Davis Mills has shined during the preseason #1 Houston Texans starting QB job looks to belong to Davis Mills The Houston Texans entered their offseason with a massive question mark next to their quarterback position. One thing that was for sure in Houston was that Deshaun Watson wouldn't be playing. That left the Houston Texans with Davis Mills, Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel.     All three of Davis Mills' longest completions tonight are play-action strikes. pic.twitter.com/OpTTA9LAeo‚Äî Rivers McCown (@riversmccown) August 22, 2021 Davis Mills has outperformed both Tyrod Taylor and Jeff Driskel over the last two preseason games. Mills completed 11 of his 22 passes for 112 yards and an interception against the Packers in Week 1. He followed that above-average performance by completing ten of his sixteen passes for 115 yards against the Cowboys. It looks like Davis Mills will head into Week 1 of the regular season as the starting quarterback in Houston. That's if a miracle doesn't happen and Deshaun Watson suddenly changes his mind.      #2 Dallas Cowboys are still searching for Dak Prescott's backup The Dallas Cowboys headed into their preseason matchup with the Houston Texans with three quarterbacks battling for one job. That job is backing up their franchise quarterback Dak Prescott. Garrett Gilbert, Cooper Rush and Ben DiNucci are all fighting for the backup role.

Cooper Rush bounced back against the Cardinals to prove he's not out of the race just yet. Ben DiNucci led the Cowboys in passing yards against the Texans, but he threw three interceptions.     With the Cowboys' preseason finale approaching quickly, Josh Rosen is starting to look even better. All three quarterbacks have had good and bad performances, making the Cowboys' backup quarterback spot an open race heading into their finale against Jacksonville.  #3 Dallas Cowboys haven't scored a rushing touchdown during the preseason The Dallas Cowboys fan base has been focused on the quarterback position and their defense. That has taken the attention away from their rushing attack. Dallas hasn't recorded a rushing touchdown in its three preseason games. Ezekiel Elliott hasn't appeared in any of the Cowboys' preseason games, but that doesn't take away their struggles. The Cowboys need their run game if they want Dak to have a successful season. With one preseason game left, the Cowboys will need their run game to find the end zone to build momentum heading into the upcoming season.Also Check Out: Complete Dallas Cowboys NFL Preseason Schedule 2021     "", ""3 worst NFL teams in 2022 according to ESPN's computer generated power index  ESPN's NFL Football Power Index (FPI) rankings have officially been released ahead of the 2022 NFL season.

They are currently in the middle of a full rebuild, especially after moving on from superstar quarterback Deshaun Watson.     The Texans appear to be at least a few years away from being playoff contenders as they look to slowly build their roster in the Draft each year.

They could potentially come together to form a solid roster from the top to bottom. But they may need another year or so to add a few more pieces and mature into playoff contenders.  #1 - Chicago Bears Chicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields It may come as a bit of a surprise that the Chicago Bears are ranked last in the FPI standings. They finished the 2021 NFL season with a 6-11 record, which isn't great, but it was still better than six other teams.        The Bears lost Allen Robinson and Khalil Mack during the 2022 NFL offseason, which is part of the reason for their poor ranking. They are hoping that Justin Fields can take a big step forward this year, though they have failed to significantly upgrade the offensive weapons around him.

In addition to a roster with holes in several areas and the legal issues surrounding quarterback Deshaun Watson, the team has several players who signed a one-year contract this offseason and will be free agents again in 2022.  Since the Texans will have very little cap space to work with in 2022, the team will likely lose important players.                   Five Houston Texans stars likely to be on the move.  #1 - Tyrod Taylor, QB Tyrod Taylor is just the bridge quarterback in Houston this year. He may easily win the starting spot over Davis Mills. Still, it's a classic case of a veteran quarterback who only holds the job until a younger player develops and takes over. In any case, Taylor has demonstrated on several occasions that he's not good enough to start in the NFL. It's hard to imagine a scenario in 2021 that would make it possible for him to return to the Texans next year.  #2 - Whitney Mercilus, OLB Whitney Mercilus is a critical player for the Texans, who has never received enough attention due to the presence of J.J. Watt. Mercilus was nominated for the second-team All-Pro in 2016. He has 54 sacks and 13 forced fumbles in his career.     After almost a decade with the franchise, the 32-year-old will hit the market next year as a free agent. He should sign with a team that is in optimal condition to win a ring. . Cincinnati Bengals v Houston Texans #3 - David Johnson, RB Some trades can go wrong for an NFL team. On a much higher level, we have the deal in which the Texans welcomed David Johnson from the Arizona Cardinals - or, in other words, the same trade that saw DeAndre Hopkins move to Arizona.     Texans: We wanna trade DeAndre HopkinsCards: hmm you sure?Texans: We want David Johnson and a second-rounderCards: /googles ‚Äúare there two david johnsons on the cardinals‚ÄùCards: ok we gotta swap fourth-rounders thoughTexans: Deal! This won‚Äôt come back to bite us at all!‚Äî Bill Barnwell (@billbarnwell) February 7, 2021 Johnson even had good numbers in 2020, averaging 4.7 yards per carry and surpassing 1000 scrimmage yards. But Hopkins is an elite wide receiver who has continued to play at a very high level with the Cardinals, while Johnson is an expensive running back that adds little to the team's overall performance. #4 - Maliek Collins, DT Maliek Collins is a solid player who'll have a starting role in the Texans' defense in 2021. Collins is the perfect example of a signing who, no matter how well he plays this season, won't be back next year because of Houston's dire financial situation.     He has performed well in his career with the Dallas Cowboys and can be an essential rotational player for several defensive lines in the NFL. Knowing he has the skills to play for a team that may reach the playoffs, he'll not return to the Texans in 2022. #5 - Randall Cobb, WR Randall Cobb won't be a free agent in 2022, but his $10.25 million salary, with only two million in dead cap if he gets cut, makes him an easy target for the Texans to make room on the salary cap - there's no way he'll be back in Houston on that salary next year. Cobb's prime was behind him when he was one of the primary weapons in the Green Bay Packers' potent offense at the beginning of the last decade. Despite reviving his career with good performances with the Dallas Cowboys and Houston in 2020, he can no longer be seen as a great wide receiver, with his skills being average at best. Cobb will be cut next year.Would be an interesting target for the Texans. Nick Caserio was in New England when the Patriots drafted Harry, and after Brandin Cooks, the Texans' best receivers are Randall Cobb and maybe Chris Conley. Harry would get opportunities. https://t.co/Fi945Jfs80‚Äî Aaron Reiss (@aaronjreiss) July 6, 2021     "", ""Ranking the NFL's 5 worst performing QBs after Week 4 2022  The quarterback is arguably the toughest position in the NFL. Winning often depends on them, and when results aren‚Äôt going well, they are the first to be blamed. The start of the 2022 NFL season has produced some sensational QB play across the league. However, this hasn‚Äôt necessarily spread to every team.  Several quarterbacks have struggled in the 2022 campaign. Whether it be through lacking rhythm with a new team or being out of their depth, some players are letting their teams down.        Here are the five NFL quarterbacks who have struggled the most in the first four weeks:           #5. Russell Wilson - Denver Broncos The grass away from Seattle has been far from green for Russell Wilson Russell Wilson has had average numbers in the opening four weeks of the NFL season. But when you look at how dismal the Denver Broncos‚Äô offense has been, it‚Äôs difficult to not judge Wilson harshly. He was expected to come into the team as the missing piece. Denver have been a QB short of a deep NFL playoff run for years. Wilson, though, has yet to find his connection with the team.     Nathaniel Hackett as a coach is mostly to blame for this. He isn‚Äôt a good offensive play-caller and has given Wilson few opportunities to succeed. This partnership isn‚Äôt blossoming and may become an issue for the Broncos‚Äô front-office before the end of the season. Wilson isn‚Äôt being allowed to play as freely as he wishes and his performances have suffered. Bleacher Report@BleacherReportGeno Smith has been outplaying Russell Wilson this season so far  @brgridiron237081416 #4. Justin Fields - Chicago Bears Justin Fields is teetering dangerously close to the black hole that Chicago QBs have inhabited for years     Justin Fields has endured a testing start to the 2022 NFL season. He is a fundamental cog within an offense that lacks playmakers. Receiver Allen Robinson hasn‚Äôt been replaced and Fields just hasn‚Äôt had the targets to throw to. As such, his play has been erratic as he's trying to force passes. He is scrambling too much, taking sacks, and rushing throws as he panics under the pressure of a collapsing pocket. Fields has a lot of natural talent and the Chicago Bears were high on him in the draft for a reason. However, they haven‚Äôt recruited the supporting cast to help him thrive. Fields hasn‚Äôt thrown a touchdown since Week 1. Furthermore, he has thrown a total of four interceptions this season. #3. Baker Mayfield - Carolina Panthers Baker Mayfield has been wildly inaccurate in his 4 games as a Panther     The Carolina Panthers look like one of the worst teams in the NFL after four games. They are 1-3 and have yet to get anything going with Baker Mayfield under center. It was an offseason of change in Carolina and the trade for Mayfield wasn‚Äôt made till quite late. He missed most of mini-camp and is looking like he needs more time to adjust to the offense. Despite having thrown a single touchdown pass in every game so far, Mayfield‚Äôs accuracy has been abysmal. He has thrown a total of 117 passes and completed just 64 of them. That is around 54%. He has also fumbled the ball six times in four games. You‚Äôre not going to win many games in the NFL with a quarterback putting up numbers like this. It just doesn't happen. You can‚Äôt necessarily put too much blame on the offense around him in Carolina. The reality is that Mayfield simply hasn‚Äôt settled and is playing exceedingly poorly.     #2. Davis Mills - Houston Texans Second season syndrome has hit Davis Mills hard The opening four games of the 2022 NFL season have been a test for Davis Mills. He impressed in a difficult 2021 campaign for the Houston Texans, showing flashes of brilliance. However, he hasn‚Äôt been able to carry that momentum into the new season. Defenses seem to have worked him out. You always fear for QBs that come into the league without much college hype. It rarely works out for them unless they are a generational talent. Mills earned a lot of plaudits in 2021 simply for being a calm head in a chaotic franchise who could throw safely and make gains.     Talk of him being a long-term replacement for Deshaun Watson now seems premature. Mills is suffering now because his 2021 performances gave people expectations that were greater than his talent. His completion percentage stands at 57. Defenses know that to stop Mills, you just rush the pocket and make him panic. He doesn‚Äôt have the requisite vision to defeat this style of defense and it‚Äôs going to be a long season for the Texans. #1. Mitchell Trubisky - Pittsburgh Steelers Trubisky can't replace Big Ben in Pittsburgh     Mitchell Trubisky pips Davis Mills to the unwanted top spot in this list due to the fact that the former Bears QB does have NFL talent. He‚Äôs never going to be a solid starter in a contending team, but if Kirk Cousins can have an NFL career, then there's no reason why Trubisky can‚Äôt. This career, though, won‚Äôt be with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Having already been usurped by Kenny Pickett, Steelers fans will be hoping they‚Äôve seen the last of Trubisky. Two touchdowns and two interceptions in four games is hardly a glowing stat line. His performances just give no confidence to the offense around him and the Steelers shouldn‚Äôt be performing this poorly with their current roster. Trubisky has been part of the problem. He can‚Äôt lead an elite offense as he struggles to make plays under pressure and takes too many unnecessary hits when he can release the ball sooner.     It was an experiment worth trying by Mike Tomlin after Ben Roethlisberger‚Äôs retirement. They didn‚Äôt know which quarterbacks would be around in the draft and had to get someone with experience in the league. Trubisky hasn‚Äôt surprised anyone or exceeded expectations and can expect to find a different franchise in 2023. Josh Carney@ByJoshCarneyThis is what I've been talking about when criticizing Mitch Trubisky. He simply was not seeing the field well, and quite frankly, never has. Throws have been there all season long. He just doesn't pull the trigger. Say what you want about Canada, but scheme is fine. twitter.com/TriggeredWise/‚Ä¶Tyler Wise@TriggeredWiseThe difference between Pickett and Trubisky. #Steelers11711      Quick Links       Houston Texans   Denver Broncos   Pittsburgh Steelers   Carolina Panthers   Russell Wilson   Mitchell Trubisky        More from Sportskeeda       Edited by John Maxwell         √ó               Feedback  Thank You!

Due to his difficult season, Dak Prescott's time as the Dallas Cowboys' starting quarterback may be coming to an end. He had a point to make in the playoffs that would have helped quell some playoff scrutiny, but he fell short of expectations again.  With 15 interceptions, Prescott is atop the league with Houston's Davis Mills. Prescott has passed for 166 touchdowns and 24,943 yards in his seven-year tenure. But he also has 52 fumbles and 65 interceptions.        So, you can see why owner Jerry Jones was so taken with the stand-in Cooper Rush while Prescott was injured, especially considering Prescott's 2-4 postseason record. We have seen Prescott suffer from injuries even just this season, but will Rush be able to take over entirely as the Cowboys' main quarterback?

He performed so effectively that several observers and fans were rooting for him to keep starting even after Prescott was healthy.     Rush had 956 yards, five scores, and three interceptions through those five starts. In three of the games, he completed more than 60% of his throws, and he finished with an 81.9 quarterback rating throughout that span. After handing Prescott his starting job back, the Cowboys ended the regular season with a 12-5 mark, placing them second in the NFC East. NFL@NFLThe final play that sends the @49ers to the NFC Championship! #NFLPlayoffs88311380 Rush has participated in 19 games in his career, completing 59.0% of his throws for 1,475 yards, 8 TDs, and 4 INTs. Although he goes by the name Rush, he is not particularly adept at rushing. Rush has only carried the ball 20 times for 11 yards.     Dak Prescott has barely completed half of a four-year, $160 million contract. From a strictly financial standpoint, the Cowboys are unable to end things with Prescott because he will receive a guaranteed $31 million for the upcoming season. He likely won't be dealt, but if he fails to get a solid start in 2023, there may be good cause to believe Cooper Rush will replace him as the starter. The Cowboys and possibly other quarterback-needy franchises now have something to discuss, thanks to Rush's good performances. It remains to be seen what awaits the 29-year-old in the offseason. Cooper Rush‚Äôs timeline Cooper Rush started 49 games for Central Michigan University, accumulating 12,891 yards and 90 TDs in the air. However, he wasn't selected in the 2017 NFL draft. As a sophomore, Rush threw for an NCAA bowl record seven touchdowns and led CMU in a 49-48 loss to Western Kentucky in the 2014 Bahamas Bowl. Rush's pass on the final play led to a wild 75-yard touchdown that pulled the Chippewas, who had trailed 49-14, to within one point, but his two-point conversion pass was unsuccessful.     Barstool Sports@barstoolsportsSkip thinks Cooper Rush would‚Äôve beat the 49ers yesterday. Embrace debate3732152 The Dallas Cowboys recognized his potential and acquired him as a free agent.

When Prescott hurt his right thumb this season, he started five games, winning four straight.     "", 'NFL Fantasy Football Week 9: Quarterback rankings  Week 9 of the 2022 Fantasy Football season will prove to be one of the most challenging of the year when managers go to set their lineups. This is because six NFL teams are on a bye week.  Fewer teams playing means fewer options to choose from in Fantasy Football this week. This is particularly crucial for the quarterback position as each NFL team generally only uses one of them each week. With six teams in a bye week, only 26 starting quarterbacks will play a game, compared to a maximum of 32 quarterbacks.        Dak Prescott and Russell Wilson headline the quarterbacks that are not playing this week, along with Jimmy Garoppolo and Daniel Jones, who may be used as starters during other weeks. While Jacoby Brissett and Kenny Pickett will also be unavailable this week.               Fantasy managers featuring any of the six quarterbacks on their rosters will need to look at a replacement. Matchups are always important during each week of the Fantasy Football season, as well as paying attention to recent trends and performances.     The following rankings may help fantasy managers when setting their lineups for Week 9. Quarterbacks are often the highest scoring fantasy players. Solidifying the position each week can be a winning strategy.

It‚Äôs one of the essential parts of the off-season because it‚Äôs when they finalize their active rosters.   The new Collective Bargaining Agreement states that teams can bring as many as 90 players to camp. Depending on the player‚Äôs performance at camp and the depth chart of respective positions, teams reduce the count to 75 after the first cut.         They then reduce it to the 53-man roster in the second and final cuts. Some players not favored to join the main roster might be included in the practice squad.            But despite the considerable sample size of talent, some teams have less threatening offensive units than legitimate contenders. Bad drafts, poor trades, and salary cap mismanagement could be some of the reasons leading to struggles in producing points.  That said, these are the NFL teams whose offenses do not strike much fear among opposing teams heading into the new season.  #5. Arizona Cardinals NFL athletes Kyler Murray and Marquise Brown of the Arizona Cardinals attend Game Four of the NBA Western Conference Semifinals between the Phoenix Suns and the Denver Nuggets at Footprint Center on May 07, 2023, in Phoenix, Arizona.     Releasing star wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins watered down Arizona‚Äôs talent at wide receiver. They still have an excellent wideout duo in Marquise Brown and Rondale Moore, but they combined for only 1,123 yards and four touchdowns.  James Conner will also have difficulty running the ball if Brown and Moore cannot create separation from their defenders. He has been their best option on offense, tallying 22 rushing touchdowns in his first two seasons at Arizona.  The Cardinals‚Äô offensive line situation will make it harder for Conner to dominate. Pro Football Focus ranked Arizona as the second-worst O-line coming into the season.  Drafting Paris Johnson Jr. is a slight boost, but it might not be enough when facing top-tier defensive players like Nick Bosa and Aaron Donald at least twice in 2023.  Finally, Kyler Murray‚Äôs situation is still questionable. He is still on the road to recovery after suffering an ACL tear. While he has had plenty of time rehabilitating his knee, his status for Week 1 is still up in the air.      If that happens, Colt McCoy will likely start the season at quarterback for the Cardinals.  #4. Chicago Bears Justin Fields #1 of the Chicago Bears speaks to the media during minicamp at Halas Hall on June 15, 2023, in Lake Forest, Illinois. There‚Äôs no question about Justin Fields‚Äô mobility. Last season, he became only the third quarterback in NFL history to have a 1,000-yard rushing season.  But can he accurately throw? The former Ohio State standout has a 59.7 completion percentage through his first two years. He did improve from 58.9 to 60.4 year-to-year, but it still isn‚Äôt enough to compete with fellow AFC North quarterbacks Kirk Cousins and Jared Goff.      If Fields cannot hit his targets, DJ Moore might struggle to get yards and touchdowns. The Bears traded for Moore to surrender the number pick of the 2023 draft to the Carolina Panthers.  It‚Äôs a fantastic deal on paper, considering he had 1,000 receiving yards in three of his first five seasons. Moore also had a career-high seven touchdowns in 2022.  Meanwhile, Chase Claypool‚Äôs lack of self-motivation might haunt the Bears. He might be out of the team if his attitude doesn‚Äôt change. He is capable of great things, as proven by his 873 yards and nine touchdowns during his rookie season with the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Lastly, PFF ranked the Bears‚Äô offensive line 21st out of the 32 teams. They shuffled positions throughout the 2022 season and haven‚Äôt made enough efforts to address their concerns. Braxton Jones at left tackle and Cody Whitehair at center give them a stable line.  #3. Indianapolis Colts     Anthony Richardson celebrates after being selected fourth overall by the Indianapolis Colts during the first round of the 2023 NFL Draft at Union Station on April 27, 2023, in Kansas City, Missouri. The Colts‚Äô quarterback situation is their foremost concern. They are banking on Anthony Richardson to be their franchise play-caller, but it‚Äôs still early to give him the reins. The Athletic‚Äôs James Boyd wrote that while Richardson had great throws, he rarely had the best day.  Likewise, Richardson hasn‚Äôt started in consecutive seasons since high school. Indianapolis reportedly plans to be cautious about his progression, meaning that Gardner Minshew might start for the Colts in Week 1.      Minshew can make plays but he is arguably not an elite quarterback. He also played sparingly last season, backing up Jalen Hurts in Philadelphia.  Aside from quarterback, the Colts still don‚Äôt know what they have with Jonathan Taylor. Ankle injuries limited him to 11 games. He still had solid numbers of 861 yards and four touchdowns, but they were nowhere near his 2021 production when he led the league in rushing yards (1,811) and touchdowns (18).  Michael Pittman Jr. is their top option at wide receiver, but he hasn‚Äôt had a breakout season. The Colts also hope that Josh Downs will be a great slot receiver.  Indianapolis‚Äô saving grace is their offensive line. PFF ranked them 10th best this offseason. However, Quenton Nelson will be coming off his worst season as a pro, giving up five sacks last year. Notably, he allowed only four in his first four seasons.  #2. Houston Texans Quarterback C.J. Stroud, #7 of the Houston Texans, leads a team huddle during the first day of Houston Texans Rookie Minicamp at NRG Stadium on May 12, 2023, in Houston, Texas.     The Texans have the pieces to be a dark horse squad in 2023, especially with the AFC South up for grabs. But their fate will depend on how C.J. Stroud and John Metchie will perform this season.  Stroud will likely be the team‚Äôs starting quarterback from Week 1. There‚Äôs no sense in putting Davis Mills at the top of the depth chart because Stroud is a steadier option than Richardson. But growing pains are possible, especially behind an offensive line ranked 25th by Pro Football Focus.  Meanwhile, Metchie III will finally play after skipping his rookie season due to acute promyelocytic leukemia. The Texans are in for a treat if he performs like in his final year at Alabama (1,142 yards, eight touchdowns).  Dameon Pierce showed promise during his rookie campaign with 939 rushing yards and four touchdowns. But whether he has fully recovered from a season-ending ankle injury remains to be seen.      Outside of those three players, the Texans‚Äô offense is riddled with questions. Can Robert Woods perform like a top option at quarterback? Can Dalton Schultz deliver the catches and yards in a team that doesn‚Äôt have a bona fide threat downfield? Time will tell.  Lastly, can anyone other than Laremy Tunsil be trusted on the Texans‚Äô offensive line? Shaq Mason helps stabilize the fort, but having a rookie center in Juice Scruggs might cause problems. The offensive line must also improve their paltry 0.8 yards before contact in last year‚Äôs run game.  #1. Tennessee Titans Joshua Dobbs, #11 of the Tennessee Titans, hands the ball off Derrick Henry, #22 of the Tennessee Titans, during the second quarter against the Jacksonville Jaguars at TIAA Bank Field on January 07, 2023, in Jacksonville, Florida.     Derrick Henry is still a monster, finishing with 1,538 yards and 13 touchdowns last season. Unfortunately, the NFL hasn‚Äôt been kind to aging running backs. The inevitable decline will come, even if Henry is one of the most imposing backfield options in the league.  Therefore, the Titans must find his heir apparent or gradually shift towards prioritizing the passing game. Unfortunately, the results of their efforts haven‚Äôt generated much fruit so far.  They traded A.J. Brown for the Philadelphia Eagles‚Äô first-round pick last year. They used it on Treylon Burks, who had 444 yards and a touchdown in 11 games during his rookie season.  Nick Westbrook-Ikhine isn‚Äôt much help either, tallying 397 yards and three touchdowns. Their struggles in the passing game led the Titans to average 17.5 points per game, the fourth-worst last season.  Pro Football Focus also ranked Tennessee‚Äôs offensive line as the league‚Äôs worst, leading into the offseason. They drafted Peter Skoronski in round one of the 2023 draft, and he could be their best player in the trench. Furthermore, Nicholas Petit-Frere‚Äôs six-game suspension won‚Äôt help their cause either.      Finally, the succession plan at quarterback still isn‚Äôt clear. They didn‚Äôt offer Ryan Tannehill a contract extension, making 2023 potentially his final year as the Titans starter. Choosing between Malik Willis and Will Levis arguably isn‚Äôt the best of choices because of their respective flaws.      ']"

', ""Russell Wilson's career stats: How poorly is Broncos QB performing compared to his Seahawks days?  Russell Wilson's career stats have been excellent as a whole since he entered the NFL prior to the start of the 2012 season. He has now spent more than a decade as a starting quarterback in the league. He has pretty consistently been one of the best overall players at his position during his generation of football.  Russell Wilson's place among elite quarterbacks in the NFL became widely accepted during nearly his entire ten years with the Seattle Seahawks. The 2022 NFL season marks his first with a new team since joining the Denver Broncos during the offseason via trade. Here is how Russell Wilson's career stats have played out during his NFL journey.        Russell Wilson's career stats with the Seattle Seahawks           Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson Russell Wilson was selected with the 75th overall pick in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft by the Seattle Seahawks. He was initially projected to serve as their backup quarterback, while possibly one day developing into a potential starting quarterback. Wilson was so impressive during training camp and the preseason during his rookie year that he immediately won the starting job. Head coach Pete Carroll's decision turned out to be the right one as Wilson made an instant impact.         Russell Wilson started every game for the Seahawks during his first nine years with the team. He posted a winning record in all nine of them, while making it to the NFL Playoffs eight times. He also helped the Seahawks make two Super Bowl appearances and won the ring in one of them. Russell Wilson's career stats were consistently solid with the Seahawks. He recorded, at least, 20 touchdown passes in all of his ten seasons with the Seahawks. He exceeded 30 touchdowns five times. He also surpassed 3,000 passing yards in all ten seasons, while eclipsing 4,000 passing yards four times. He has also completed, at least, 61 percent of his passes in every season of his career.     Russell Wilson's career stats: Denver Broncos Denver Broncos QB Russell Wilson Russell Wilson is having the worst statistical season of his career in his first year with the Denver Broncos. He currently has a career-low 57.4 completion percentage at the conclusion of Week 10. He has thrown just seven touchdown passes in his first eight games.     Wilson is currently on pace to throw just 14 touchdown passes during the 2022 NFL season. This could be a new career low. He is also on pace to throw ten interceptions. This would be the fourth-most in any season of his career. Russell Wilson's career stats have certainly taken a hit this year, but he still has time to potentially turn things around.     "", 'Broncos QB Russell Wilson gets cooked on social media after another disastrous performance  Russell Wilson\'s horrendous start to the 2022 NFL season continued on Monday night, as the Denver Broncos quarterback dropped another disastrous performance against the Los Angeles Chargers in his team\'s 19-16 loss.  Wilson attempted 28 passes and completed only 15 for 188 passing yards against a Chargers defense that ranked 31st in the league in points allowed.

The Broncos gave up three players and five picks for the former Seattle Seahawks quarterback, only to see his replacement in Seattle outplay him so far this season. Wilson is on the Broncos\' books until the 2028 NFL season. If the quarterback fails to turn around this poor form, the team will face the horror of having to field an aging and declining signal-caller for multiple seasons, who is realistically untradeable due to the size of his contract.     The Broncos will likely not pull the plug on Wilson this early in his tenure as a member of their roster. They will exercise patience and exhaust every option before benching the quarterback or cutting ties via a trade or release.But given the size of his contract and the fact that they have traded their top two picks in the 2023 and 2024 NFL drafts to the Seahawks, it will be tough for the Broncos to field more talent around Russell Wilson than they currently do.It\'s not looking good in Mile High.

Russell Wilson needs a bounce-back year in Denver Denver Broncos v Baltimore Ravens     With Wilson swapping Seattle for Denver last offseason, many thought the Broncos were in Super Bowl contention, but it was quickly apparent that they weren\'t. Wilson went 4-11 as the starter, resulting in coach Nathaniel Hackett losing his job. The offense was the worst in the NFL for points scored per game (just 16.9). Now with Sean Payton at the helm, there is fresh optimism that Denver can mount a challenge in the AFC, but that is predicated on Wilson playing a lot better than last season.Denver has a strong enough defense to be a legitimate contender for the Super Bowl, but the offense needs to perform.While the signing of Ben Dinucci may not change anything for the Broncos, the focus is firmly on Russell Wilson to make a big comeback next season.

"", '""It\'s been incredible"" - Ciara opens up about starting a new chapter with Russell Wilson in Denver  Ciara and Russell Wilson were first linked with each other in 2015. Always ready to support one another, the couple recently started a new journey in Denver. Following a long stint with Seattle Seahawks, this is Wilson\'s first season with the Denver Broncos.  Naturally, a change in location can be significant for many. This includes the 36-year-old. While there is no predicting how one\'s NFL journey will go, Wilson and his family could be in Denver for a long time.                     In a recent interview, Ciara spoke up about the move to Denver. They spent a decade in Seattle, making this an important milestone for the family. She seemed satisfied with the change, even if it needed some adjustments. ""Denver\'s amazing. The altitude is a beast. Walking up three - just like one flight of stairs, I\'m like, \'Okay, I need some water. I need to take a deep breath. I got to come back. Alright, I\'m back.\' I mean, it\'s really something and you feel it, but it\'s been incredible.     ""The fans have been amazing. The food is amazing. The way to my heart is good. I\'m so happy. I love our home. My kids are happy in school. I love Denver - it\'s pretty amazing."" Ciara was also in the news due to her new collab with Walker Hayes. The singer has a successful career of her own. Is Ciara\'s connection to her ex affecting Russell Wilson\'s performance? Ciara broke up with rapper Future years ago. However, some have found a way to connect the celebrities together. Apparently, Future\'s song lyrics could be hinting at a possible relationship with Russell Wilson\'s better half. A recently released song featured Future saying this line: ""I‚Äôm the type to go after B and I still smash on C.""     The C, some think, could mean Ciara. Most dismissed the theory, wondering how one can be sure that he meant her by the letter. Russell Wilson\'s wife at the Denver Broncos v Las Vegas Raiders game Some ultimately connected the dots to Wilson, wondering if the off-screen drama was affecting his performance with the Broncos. While he had joined the team with promise, Wilson has underperformed with the Broncos. This season, Russ has five passing touchdowns, an 82.3 quarterback rating (23), and the fifth-lowest completion percentage in the NFL. Fans eventually called out those responsible for the trade, making it clear that it was a bad decision. Some have blamed Future and his ex, while others seem to wonder if it is just a bad phase.       His performance against the Los Angeles Chargers was particularly disappointing. Wilson went three-for-eleven with 15 passing yards, with a QB rating of 39.6.

Russell Wilson  The opening week of the NFL season was a memorable one, with football finally returning to center stage on the sporting calendar.  There was so much good football played against the backdrop of a very emotional United States population as the country mourned the 21st anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks.        With the offseason being so long, it‚Äôs easy for fans to build up false narratives in their minds and convince themselves that a team is going to do better than the previous year.           However, with expectations come pressure and the opening week of the 2022 NFL season saw a number of disappointing performances, not least from Russell Wilson on his return to Seattle.  #1 Trey Lance | San Francisco 49ers NFL fans have been waiting to see how Trey Lance adapts to the league Sunday marked the start of the Trey Lance era in Santa Clara. He waited and waited for his time, and now Kyle Shanahan has given him the keys.     Unfortunately, it was a night to forget for the quarterback as he struggled in the torrential rain that engulfed Soldier Field. He went completed 13 out 28 attempts for 164 yards and had one interception. While the signs of the 49ers‚Äô promising rushing game were still there, it was clear that this was not yet Lance‚Äôs offense. Shanahan will have work to do in order to make the gameplan more suited to his QB. This was such a disappointing display because fans have waited so long for the promise of the player they moved up in the draft to select. It will take time, but the immediate signs were underwhelming. #2 La‚ÄôEl Collins | Cincinnati Bengals La\'El Collins couldn\'t protect Joe Burrow in Week 1 of the 2022 NFL Season     Protecting Joe Burrow was the number one priority for the Cincinnati Bengals in the offseason. With all but one member of their offensive line making their debut in Week 1 of the NFL season, the franchise believed they had done just that. Jim Rome@jimromeNot seeing any improvement on the Bengals\' O-Line. Same as it ever was.14111 La‚ÄôEl Collins was one offseason signing in the offensive tackle position, and expectations were high ahead of the NFL opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers. What followed, however, was nothing short of a disaster. Burrow was sacked seven times, as Collins failed to protect his QB.     In all fairness, everyone on the O-Line was at fault, but there were such high expectations on Collins that his performance was a particular negative. #3 Sauce Gardner | New York Jets Sauce Gardner will improve on his debut display NFL Draft night in 2022 ended with the City of New York believing it had done the best work. Both the Giants and the Jets snared elite defensive prospects in the form of Kayvon Thibodeaux and Ahmad ""Sauce"" Gardner. So, there was understandable frustration at how Gardner appeared to underwhelm on a Jets defense that suffered at the hands of the Baltimore Ravens in Week 1.     Gardner made just two tackles and wasn‚Äôt able to be the game-changing presence many thought he would be upon arrival in the Big Apple. With that being said, his performance was average to okay, it‚Äôs just expectations were much higher. David Wyatt-Hupton@DWyattHuptonSauce Gardner can fall down and still play better coverage than we\'ve seen from a Jets corner in 3 years. That man is going to be something special. #TakeFlight1184 The talent is clearly there. He did allow only one catch for eight yards on debut, but surely, there is more to come from the cornerback. PFF ranked him as the eighth-best CB to play in the NFL in Week 1, which is not bad, but expectations from Jets fans are that he will be a lot closer to the top 5 for much of the season.     #4 Mac Jones | New England Patriots Mac Jones and the entire Patriots offense stumbled in Miami Mac Jones endured a rough start to the season in Miami with the Dolphins defense getting to him on two occasions. He simply couldn‚Äôt build the rhythm that marked him out as one of the standout rookies in the 2021 NFL season. He threw for just one touchdown against the Dolphins. He also threw an interception and was unable to guide his team into any real position to win in Miami.     Bill Belichick knows how to get his team winning, but with confusion over who exactly is calling offensive plays this term, it‚Äôs not hugely surprising to see Jones struggling early on. #5 Russell Wilson | Denver Broncos Russell Wilson has yet to settle with the Denver Broncos In what was the big story in Week 1 of the 2022 NFL season, Russell Wilson made his return to Seattle as a member of the Denver Broncos. After a blockbuster trade in the offseason, Wilson was given a mixed reception by Seahawks fans, yet he didn‚Äôt necessarily make them regret their taunts and boos on the field.     Getting used to a new offense is always a process for a player. While there were no glaring moments of calamity in Wilson‚Äôs performance on Monday, he wasn‚Äôt able to win the game, which is what he has been brought in to do. He completed 29 of 42 passes for 340 yards and one touchdown. Years of under-par QB play have left Broncos fans yearning for someone like Wilson to come in and be their savior. Nathaniel Hackett made the curious decision not to give Wilson the chance to win the team the game with seconds remaining. Instead, he opted to try for a 64-yard field goal, which was always going to be a tough ask. Wilson will be a star for the Broncos, likely starting in Week 2 of the NFL season, but his debut for Denver did not mark the improvement fans expected at the position.

During OTAs, the quarterback took some time off to enjoy a family retreat in Montana with his wife, the renowned singer and songwriter Ciara, and their children. Escaping from the pressures of being an NFL quarterback and a globally recognized singer, the family enjoyed fishing and the refreshing Montana air. Ciara even referred to Montana as ""home"" during their Memorial Day stay.                View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post           Wilson won\'t call Denver \'home\' for much longer if he stinks again in 2023 In today\'s digital age, patience is scarce, and success must come quickly, or everything can crumble. Wilson needs to elevate his game this year to salvage his career and prove that the 2022 season with the Denver Broncos was an anomaly. Reflecting on past achievements won\'t suffice if Wilson doesn\'t bring his best version to the field in 2023. With a new coach like Payton, who is likely to bring a stricter structure, the offensive game plan is expected to undergo significant changes. The emphasis may shift towards a more prominent running game, quick-strike passing with primary reads, and a reasonable dose of screen plays. Wilson must execute the game plan rather than relying on his personal judgment, as was often reported in the previous season. If Wilson\'s performance still falls short in Denver, the team may consider trading him. Despite the high cost associated with such a move, the new owners, eager for a return on their substantial investment, may view it as a necessary solution to address the problem.     ', 'NFL analyst predicts Russell Wilson to make remarkable improvement under Sean Payton after last season‚Äôs ‚Äòawful‚Äô performance  As Russell Wilson likely knows, the old cliche is that it\'s always darkest before the dawn. If the 2022 season was the darkest moment for the quarterback, the end of the 2023 season would need to be high noon. At least, that is what NFL analyst Damien Woody predicted on ESPN\'s ""First Take"" this week.  Here\'s how he put it when asked who the most improved quarterback will be in 2023:                   ""I\'m going with a veteran. Anyone who watched Russell Wilson last year, quite honestly, he stunk. He was awful. ... I thought he was out of shape, to be honest with you. He looked slow, unathletic, and I think Sean Payton, to me, it\'s going to be the key. ""As far as his play is concerned, he\'s going to bring a type of structure around (him). That\'s going to get him back on track. Russell Wilson, for most of his career, has been, like, at minimum in the mid-60s completion percentage-wise. ... I just think that Sean Payton is going to be the guy to get him back on track. I think this going to be a bounce-back year.""     Nick Ferguson@NickFerguson_25Broncos LT Garrett Bolles doubled down on his validation of QB Russell Wilson. While also sending a direct message to all of his biggest critics. It‚Äôs easy for some to criticize when they‚Äôre on the outside looking in. #BroncosCountry708 UNDISPUTED@undisputedWill we eat crow about Russell Wilson?""Sean Payton wouldn\'t have taken the job unless he thought he could savage this. But these numbers suggest Russell Wilson is on his way down and out."" ‚Äî @RealSkipBayless6011 Russell Wilson aims to turn Damien Woody\'s prediction into reality     Russell Wilson The quarterback of the Denver Broncos might have taken the imaginary award for Greatest Fall in 2022 after posting a career-low in throwing touchdowns, passer rating and touchdown-interception ratio. It was also the fewest wins he\'s ever secured in games he started in a season.        Many fans are going into this year with a grain of salt invested in expectations for the quarterback. Of course, some will put all their eggs in one basket for him, but after 2022, most will be pleasantly surprised if the quarterback suddenly rebounds into his previous, nine-time Pro Bowler version. How long will it take to know if Russell Wilson is a bust? Russell Wilson     Most expect the answer to the quarterback\'s future by the end of the first quarter of the season. By the end of the first four games, it will be clear whether the team needs to restart their quarterback carousel or if the quarterback duo with Sean Payton will work.    Last season, some fans began losing hope after the Week 2 loss to the Houston Texans, but it was undeniable by the end of a 12-9 loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Oct. 6. With Sean Payton in tow, the patience of fans appears to be somewhat restored, but a cooling could happen even faster if Wilson doesn\'t flash quickly.If any of the above quotes are used, please credit ""First Take"" and H/T Sportskeeda.

73,C.J. Beathard,"[""3 reasons why the Ravens and Cowboys need CJ Beathard  CJ Beathard is currently playing for his career in Florida. North of his position, the Ravens are at Defcon One at backup quarterback. West of his position, the Cowboys are drawing straws at backup quarterback.  Both teams currently do not have a solution for the position. Tyler Huntley, a third-string quarterback, is the Ravens' current backup. Meanwhile, the Cowboys can't pick from three third-string quarterbacks, which makes CJ Beathard a great fit for both teams.         Here's why both teams should be competing to get the quarterback this summer.            #1 CJ Beathard's Week-Two performance For those who made it to the end of the Monday Night Football broadcast, they were rewarded with an offensive explosion. CJ Beathard came into the game down multiple possessions, and ended the game with a two-point deficit. Beathard went nine for 14, and threw for 121 yards and two touchdowns in about half a quarter. Jaguars QB Competition Update:CJ Beathard: 13/16, 102 yds, 1 TD, 0 sacksTrevor Lawrence: 6/9, 71 yds, 0 TD, 2 sacksNumbers don't lie #Hawkeyes pic.twitter.com/GlCtdxFQmc‚Äî Barstool Hawkeyes (@BarstoolUIowa) August 22, 2021 Before Beathard, the Jaguars had scored three points. Beathard helped the Jaguars score 18 points in the fourth quarter. No backup Ravens or Cowboys quarterback has been able to come anywhere close to that type of performance.      #2 CJ Beathard's experience While the Cowboys and Ravens' backups have all barely seen the field during the regular season, CJ Beathard has started 12 games in the NFL.  Any NFL experience is good experience. The more experience a quarterback has, the more comfortable they are while running an NFL offense in the heat of the game and the higher the chances of a good output from the team.     12 games of experience is a massive gap early in a player's career. 12 games is almost a full rookie season. Basically, CJ Beathard has already almost completed a rookie season in the NFL. It could take the Ravens and Cowboys' backups years to get this number of starts as a backup. However, with Beathard, the growing pains are largely done.      #3 CJ Beathard has been on the up Jacksonville Jaguars Training Camp CJ Beathard admittedly started slow early in his career. He was 1-9 in his first ten games. However, since then, he has been on the up, going 1-1. 2020 saw him throw for six touchdowns and zero interceptions. It is unclear what lit the fire under Beathard.That said, after his Week Two performance on Monday Night Football and his 2020 stats, CJ Beathard looks like a ship poised for takeoff. If the Cowboys or Ravens do land him, they might be surprised with what they got.     "", ""Luis Perez NFL Potential: 3 Teams that should target XFL Championship MVP  The XFL Championship saw a star born in Luis Perez. The quarterback was excellent in guiding his 8.5-point underdog Arlington Renegades over the D.C. Defenders. Perez, who won XFL Championship MVP, and head coach Bob Stoops were on point last night.  Perez tossed three touchdowns while completing 26/36 passes for 288 yards. He had no interceptions and added 10 yards on the ground, too. With a performance like this under his belt, NFL teams may take notice. Here's which ones should give him a shot at the next level.                   The Jacksonville Jaguars could use Luis Perez XFL@XFL2023Someone called Sal  41-yard TD makes it 6-0 for the @XFLRenegades #XFL | #XFLChampionship61291 The Jacksonville Jaguars have Trevor Lawrence, so there'd be no need for Luis Perez to play. However, he might be a better backup than CJ Beathard. Plus, if Perez is ever going to become an NFL quarterback, Lawrence is a great person to play behind and learn from. For both parties, this could be a fruitful partnership that's certainly worth looking into.      The Las Vegas Raiders make sense Where could Luis Perez go? The Las Vegas Raiders make a lot of sense for Perez, too. Jimmy Garoppolo feels like a long-term bridge quarterback and they passed on drafting his replacement in the 2023 NFL Draft.  Could Perez, who is three years younger than Garoppolo, be a more long-term solution for the franchise after his Championship win? Possibly, and it wouldn't hurt to let him learn from the two-time Super Bowl champion who has now been on three teams.      The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are best suited for Luis Perez    The Tampa Bay Buccaneers currently feature a quarterback room of Kyle Trask and Baker Mayfield. That is not something that inspires a lot of hope with the fans, but if there's a team that Perez might actually get playing time with, it's probably the Buccaneers. He's a long shot to play anywhere since the competition at the NFL level is far better than at the XFL level, but the Buccaneers don't have a lot of great options. They could be Perez's shot at making it like PJ Walker before him. He's probably going to be a backup wherever he goes, but there's a quarterback battle going on in Tampa already, so why not join?     ""]"

Jackson\'s performance in college was an integral aspect of the quarterback\'s career heading forward. After an iconic three-year stint with the Cardinals, Jackson is currently using his talents to play for the Baltimore Ravens in the NFL.  LeBron James\' dynamic with Lamar Jackson LeBron James looks on at an LA Lakers game     LeBron James is widely regarded as one of the greatest athletes of all time. Given the natural athleticism paired with his discipline in taking care of his body, James continues to be an elite athlete even at 36 years old. Showing his love for football through the years with his support for the University of Ohio\'s college team as well as the Cleveland Browns, LeBron James\' love for the game is also matched by his proficiency for the game. LeBron James was widely regarded as one of the best football prospects in the state of Ohio. Back in his high school days, James represented St. Vincent-St. Mary as a two-sport athlete. Playing only two full seasons of high school football, James still ranks seventh in the school with 27 career touchdowns. Lamar Jackson was a widely reputed college athlete. Winning the prestigious Heisman Trophy during his sophomore year in Louisville, Jackson was the first ever player from the Louisville Cardinals to win the award.     Continuing his success as a quarterback as he joined the NFL, Lamar Jackson won the unanimous MVP award in his sophomore season with the Baltimore Ravens. Jackson recently earned a comparison to LeBron James. After leading the Ravens to a win after coming back from their third double-digit deficit in the second half of the game. In a performance that saw the Baltimore Ravens overcome the Minnesota Vikings after being down by 14 points, the quarterback was compared to the LA Lakers superstar by ESPN analyst and former Dallas Cowboys Marcus Spears. Baltimore Ravens@RavensMVP‚ÄºÔ∏èMVP‚ÄºÔ∏è@Lj_era83:15 AM ¬∑ Nov 8, 20211990325With claims that Lamar Jackson could be MVP for multiple years on end while additionally being viewed by some as the best player in the NFL, it is safe to say that the two athletes share mutual respect for being dominant in their fields.     ', ""Eagles make Ravens' Lamar Jackson treatment look worse with Jalen Hurts' $255 million extension  Jalen Hurts just signed a massive contract extension with the Philadelphia Eagles. The star quarterback signed a five-year extension worth $255 million. This makes him the highest-paid player in NFL history with a $51 million salary. No other player has ever had more.  While Hurts' contract is going to have ripple effects on the entire league and perhaps the sport in general, it is making one team look a lot worse: the Baltimore Ravens.                     The Ravens have refused to sign their own star quarterback to a lengthy contract. They were unable to come to terms last offseason and now Lamar Jackson is a free agent with zero intention of playing with the Ravens anymore. The Eagles avoided all of this by signing Hurts earlier. They also avoided any drama by offering him what he's worth, perhaps even more than that. Hurts isn't the best player in NFL history, but the Eagles knew what they had to do to keep one of the most important quarterbacks in the league.        Though it's too late, the Ravens could learn a thing or two from them. Had they gone this route, it might have been easier and cheaper for them. Now, they might lose Jackson and be forced to start over.  Jalen Hurts' signing makes the Lamar Jackson saga even more confusing Jalen Hurts is an excellent player. He is a dynamic rusher and one of the league's best passers. However, there's an argument that he's not better than Lamar Jackson.     The Ravens quarterback won MVP in 2019. Hurts is coming off an MVP runner-up season, but winning the award is certainly better than coming in second. Hurts also went to the Super Bowl, something Jackson hasn't done. However, that's a team accolade. The Eagles made the Super Bowl, not just Hurts. They did so by forming one of the league's most well-rounded teams, something that will now be more difficult, admittedly. NFL fans and pundits can argue Jalen Hurts vs. Lamar Jackson all day long and go either way, but the simple fact of the matter is that the Eagles did what the Ravens should have. The Jalen Hurts extension makes Lamar Jackson's situation worse     They signed their star player and rewarded him for his growth and performance. The Ravens had no intention of doing that and it's going to cost them.Not only is Jackson possibly gone, but this entire saga will be remembered by potential free agents in the future. The Ravens now look like a bad franchise that free agents shouldn't play for.     "", 'Lamar Jackson contract: Ravens-Lamar Contract Talks: Three possible outcomes  It\'s no secret that the Baltimore Ravens and Lamar Jackson can\'t agree on a contract. Since the 2022 offseason, Jackson has requested a contract extension with ""Purple Pain"" that mirrors the contract given to Deshaun Watson by the Cleveland Browns.  The Browns gave Watson a fully guaranteed $230 million contract. Baltimore, however, is clearly not willing to give Jackson a deal that is that enormous and fully guaranteed.        Jackson is the driving force of the team\'s offense, as most of their plays are tailored to suit his unique style of play, including running the ball. When healthy, Jackson is box office, as evidenced by his unanimous MVP-winning season, a feat that has only been achieved once before in the league.           The Ravens Realm@RealmRavensLamar Jackson‚Äôs no-look TD Pass has lived in my head rent free all season2410246 The Ravens are aware of Jackson\'s value to the team, but for a quarterback who has received over 700 hits in his five years in the league, there are questions about his long-term health status.     Jackson has missed 30% of possible games due to injuries, which is a major concern for the Ravens. So the question on everyone\'s mind is, what is the way forward?  Should Baltimore trade Lamar Jackson to teams like the Colts and Jets for first-round draft picks? Or should they offer him a guaranteed contract worth over $200 million and hope he doesn\'t get injured and put the team in a dire situation? Here are the possible outcomes for the Jackson-Baltimore conundrum:  #1 Offer Lamar Jackson a contract that meets his financial demands Baltimore Ravens Lamar     Not the ideal outcome for the Baltimore Ravens because offering Jackson a deal over $200 million fully guaranteed involves taking financial risks. Offering Jackson what he wants might put them in a bad place financially if his injury worries continue or his performances decline. Yet again, Lamar Jackson has proven his prowess and dedication to the team, and it might be a risk worth taking.  #2 Ravens trade Lamar for as many draft picks as possible Pittsburgh v Baltimore     Some teams might be willing to take up Jackson as their franchise quarterback and meet up with his demands. Again, not an ideal situation for Baltimore as they have tailored their team to suit Jackson, and trading him will mean all that might go to waste. This would result in them needing to restructure the team again.  #3 Structure the contract to have a performance-based incentive Denver v Baltimore If the Ravens\' biggest worry in not wanting to offer Lamar Jackson a huge deal that is fully guaranteed is due to injury worries and a decline in performance, then they can structure a contract to tackle this.     Lamar Jackson@Lj_era8Thank you everyone for your support and concerns regarding my injuries. I want to give you all an update as I am in the recovery process. I‚Äôve suffered a PCL grade 2 sprain on the borderline of a strain 3. There is still inflammation surrounding my knee and my knee712405314 Baltimore can offer to pay Jackson as much as he is asking for with a clause to be able to terminate his deal if he fails to meet up to the agreed threshold yearly.  The Ravens and Jackson will have to weigh the pros and cons of each option and come to a decision that\'s best for both parties. Lamar Jackson is a once-in-a-generation talent, and Baltimore would be wise to keep him. Still, they must also consider the potential risks of a long-term, fully guaranteed contract.        This is a situation no general manager wants to be in, but time is ticking. Baltimore and Jackson will have to make a decision sooner rather than later.Jackson\'s future with the team is uncertain, and fans and the league will be watching closely to see what happens next.     ', 'Lamar Jackson has more to prove than Josh Allen in 2023 NFL season, claims Emmanuel Acho - ‚ÄúWant to see him more present‚Äù  Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson are two of the NFL\'s best quarterbacks. Their skill set is unique, and few players can replicate what these two quarterbacks can do.  However, both will be under pressure to perform well in the upcoming season. Each season, both of their teams have fallen short of expectations, and now Allen and Jackson must propel their teams to glory.        Jackson recently signed a five-year, $260 million extension with the Baltimore Ravens, and Emmanuel Acho believes that the Ravens QB will be under more pressure than Allen to succeed in 2023.           Here\'s what Acho said on Speak: ‚ÄúI think that Lamar has still more to prove and mainly because Josh has gotten to a conference championship game, Josh has won four playoff games‚Ä¶ I just want to see Lamar be more present. ""We know every year if Josh Allen is playing, he gonna be in the playoffs and he\'ll probably win a game or two. But I can\'t say that with any degree of certainty about Jackson and that\'s why to me like Lamar, just prove you\'ll not only be at the dance, but you\'ll be dancing when the music starts playing.‚Äù     Josh Allen suffered an injury last season, which hampered his performance but he was still able to remain on the field. Lamar Jackson, on the other hand, missed the latter half of the season and did not even play in the AFC Wildcard Game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Now that Jackson has signed his new deal, there is more pressure on him to stay healthy and make the Ravens a threat to the Kansas City Chiefs.

They signed Odell Beckham Jr. to a one-year deal and also drafted wide receiver Zay Flowers in the 2023 NFL Draft.Both OBJ and Flowers will be crucial to Jackson\'s development as a passing quarterback. Under new offensive coordinator Todd Monken, the stage is set for the Ravens QB to have a monster season and prove his critics wrong.

', '""Pay \'em now‚Äù ‚Äì Lamar Jackson sends Ravens a message fresh off handing Tom Brady‚Äôs Buccaneers third straight loss  Lamar Jackson has been on a mission since the start of the season to prove he\'s one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. The Baltimore Ravens star is trying to get a new contract. He made his case for a new deal after the Ravens defeated Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 27 -22 on Thursday night. In the victory, Jackson went 27 of 38 for 238 yards and two touchdowns. He also had nine carries for 43 yards.  For the 2019 NFL MVP, a Ravens fan at Raymond James Stadium made the case for the 25-year-old to get paid. See the tweet below:        ClutchPoints@ClutchPointsAppLamar Jackson signed a fan\'s sign that read ""Pay \'em now"" after the Ravens win over the Buccaneers ‚úçÔ∏è 36488           For the 2022 - 2023 season, the former Louisville Cardinals star will get a base salary of $23.016 million. However, it was reported that he turned down a lucrative contract extension from the Ravens in September. According to ESPN, the quarterback rejected a five-year extension offer worth over $250 million with $133 million guaranteed.        The extension would\'ve lasted through the 2027 season and would have boosted the total value of his contract to just under $274 million over six years. He would have played out the over-$23 million fifth-year option on his rookie deal before the extension started in the 2023 season. Lamar Jackson represented himself in the negotiations while leaning on the assistance of his mother, Felicia Jones, and the NFL Players Association. The union recommended that based on both his performance and age, Jackson had cause to seek a fully guaranteed contract. The Cleveland Browns signed quarterback Deshaun Watson to a $230 million fully guaranteed contract back in March. The Ravens\' offer of $133 million fully guaranteed was greater than both Russell Wilson ($124 million) and Kyler Murray ($103.3 million) was given. However, it was far from the $230 million given to Watson.  What could a Lamar Jackson contract extension look like?     Lamar Jackson - Baltimore Ravens v Tampa Bay Buccaneers The salary cap website Spotrac gave a projected market value to the All-Pro quarterback. Spotrac has the projection of a six-year $248.3 million deal with an average annual salary of $41.3 million per year. The hypothetical market value puts Jackson well behind Wilson, Murray, and Watson in terms of annual salary.   Yet, it wouldn\'t be out of the realm of possibility to make the projected deal fully guaranteed, which would surpass Watson\'s $230 million. Jackson currently has the Ravens sitting with a 5 -3 record and is looking to go on a run. We\'ll see if that market value changes as Lamar Jackson is on an MVP-like run.     ', 'NFL Trade Rumors: Drew Rosenhaus makes bold statement amid Lamar Jackson‚Äôs standoff against NFL owners  Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens appear to still be far off in contract negotiations.  Before the start of the new league year, the team placed their non-exclusive tag on the former MVP, locking him under contract before he could hit free agency.        As of now, there has been no progress on a new deal and Jackson has even requested a trade.           Many around the league and sports analysts think Jackson should hire an agent to help hammer out a long-term deal. Drew Rosenhaus, a successful NFL agent, joined the Pat McAfee Show and told Pat that he wishes to be Lamar\'s agent. ‚ÄúI wish I was the agent for Lamar Jackson, because he\'s a great football player and I\'m confident I can get a deal worked out for him. Pat, I think guarantee contracts are amazing. And obviously, as an agent, we\'d love to see all contracts in the NFL, fully guaranteed and be more consistent with what we see in Major League Baseball and the NBA. But I don\'t think you must have, let\'s say a five-year fully guaranteed contract to make it work.""     Rosenhaus then proposed that Jackson should seek a four-year fully guaranteed deal in the final year based on an injury guarantee. The 56-year-old also added that he thinks he could get a deal done if he were to represent Jackson. ""What if he did four years fully guaranteed signing and you had the final year guaranteed based on an injury guarantee, or one that becomes fully guaranteed based on performance? There should be a compromise.  ""I\'m confident I could get with the Ravens and their general manager Eric Acosta and work out a deal with their if not that, I\'m confident that I could find another team to work out a suitable deal with the franchise player and try instead of by you know, a deal for two first round picks.‚Äù     Pat McAfee@PatMcAfeeShow""I wish I was the agent for Lamar Jackson because I\'m confident I could get a deal worked out for him..There\'s ways to get deals done and I\'m confident I could get a deal done with the Ravens or another team"" ~ @DrewJRosenhaus#PMSLive40734 Many players have represented themselves and have gotten long-term deals done without agents such as DeAndre Hopkins, Russell Okung, Jacoby Brissett, and many others.

Lamar Jackson exited his Week 13 game against the Denver Broncos on the final play of the first quarter. The Baltimore Ravens superstar quarterback is reportedly dealing with a knee injury and has officially been ruled out for the remainder of the game. He was spotted leaving the sidelines and heading into the locker room to be further examined by the team's medical staff.  Jackson was initially listed as questionable to return, but he has since been officially downgraded. He will miss the rest of the game against the Broncos.

The video is followed by a clip of him walking towards the locker room. He can noticeably be seen limping a bit. Brian Y@byysportsLamar Jackson just headed back to the locker room after suffering an injury on this play 577     The injury occurred on the final play of the first quarter. Lamar Jackson was sacked by Jonathan Cooper from the Broncos' defense on a third-down play, forcing the Ravens to punt. The first quarter of the game expired following the sack, with Jackson leaving the field shortly after. Jackson never returned in the second quarter of the game as backup quarterback Tyler Huntley officially replaced him, at least temporarily. Huntley filled in for Jackson for the entire second quarter, bringing the Ravens to halftime. The Ravens officially announced that Jackson will not be returning for the second half of the game while his knee is further examined. The Ravens are likely disappointed that Jackson is unable to return to the game. But it is much more important that their superstar quarterback avoids a catastrophic diagnosis. If he's forced to miss extended time, it would be a devastating blow to their remaining outlook for the 2022 NFL season.     Lamar Jackson's 2022 NFL season Baltimore Ravens QB Lamar Jackson Lamar Jackson is having an incredible 2022 NFL season so far, as he usually does. He entered Week 13 ranked in the top ten in the NFL in passing touchdowns and the top 20 in passing yards. He ranks second among quarterbacks in rushing yards inside the top 12 among all players in the same statistical category. He is clearly one of the most dynamic quarterbacks in the league.    Jackson's dominant performances from the quarterback position are a huge reason why the Ravens are among the best teams in the NFL this year. They entered Week 13 with a solid 7-4 record, while currently leading the standings in the AFC North division.     "", ""Ranking Lamar Jackson's 3 worst games in the NFL  Lamar Jackson was heavily doubted heading into the 2018 NFL Draft, yet he became one of the best quarterbacks in the league. Now he's a must-see on TV and has defenses on tenterhooks every week for the Baltimore Ravens.  But even with a league MVP under his belt, his time in the NFL hasn‚Äôt always been peachy. While he's determined to bounce back from a poor 2021-22 season, the Ravens quarterback will have his task cut out against some of the league's most sophisticated defenses.        The annual question will surely return, will this be the year that Jackson is figured out? Although it hasn‚Äôt happened often, let‚Äôs take a look back at the three worst games of his career.           #3 Pittsburgh Steelers, 2019 Baltimore Ravens vs. Pittsburgh Steelers There is absolutely no love lost between the Baltimore Ravens and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Throw away the records and pay no attention to the players that are on the field of play. Whenever these two teams get together, blood is shed and hard hits are generated.        During an early-season game against Pittsburgh in 2019, Jackson was found wanting against a top-of-the-line Steelers defense. Jackson‚Äôs inability to complete passes was evident as he finished with just 161 passing yards. The Steelers got him time after time, resulting in three interceptions. Normally so elusive, the quarterback was unable to wriggle free from the Steelers defense. He was forced to eat turf on countless occasions. Despite his struggles, he managed to lead the Ravens to a 26-23 victory.     #2 Kansas City Chiefs, 2020 Baltimore Ravens vs. Kansas City Chiefs Lamar Jackson has continually been compared to fellow MVP counterpart, Patrick Mahomes. While Jackson has been lauded for his ability to make defenders miss, his lack of accuracy from the pocket has earned him plenty of criticism. Mahomes, on the other hand, has been a marvel with the Kansas City Chiefs. After coming up short during their head-to-head showdowns on a number of occasions, Jackson was hopeful that a reprieve of sorts would come his way as the two faced off during an early-season game in 2020.        Known for their high-powered offense, the Kansas City Chiefs showed a different dynamic to their game. Defensively, they zoned in on the quarterback. Pass after pass hit the turf, falling well short of the target.  Jackson finished the game with just 97 passing yards from 15 completed passes. Mahomes, unsurprisingly, was out of this world, throwing for 385 yards and four touchdowns. The Ravens lost the game 34-20. #1 Cleveland Browns, 2021 Baltimore Ravens vs. Cleveland Browns     Over the past few years, the Cleveland Browns have emerged from the shadows in the AFC North. Once quickly dismissed and easily defeated, the Browns are no longer an easy win. With their season teetering in 2021, Cleveland attempted to right the ship against the Baltimore Ravens during a late-season showdown. By all accounts, the Browns had everything clicking on this particular day. They pushed the Ravens quarterback out of the pocket and dared him to beat them with his legs. On most occasions, employing such a game plan would work to Jackson's benefit. But this time around, he was unable to pick apart Cleveland‚Äôs defense.Forced to use his arm, he floundered around the field, throwing for just 165 passing. To make matters worse, he had a propensity to throw the ball to the wrong team. He finished the game with four interceptions, a career high. Despite his horrific play, Baltimore held on for a six-point victory.     "", ""Will Lamar Jackson play vs. the Panthers on Sunday in Week 11?  Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens are set to face the Carolina Panthers in Week 11. There was a looming concern about the availability of the Ravens' quarterback in this game, but Jackson will be starting against the Panthers on Sunday.  Jackson missed Friday's practice due to illness and fans were worried about his health. However, Ravens head coach John Harbaugh later revealed that Lamar Jackson will be playing in Week 11.                     Jackson will go head-to-head against Baker Mayfield once again. Both quarterbacks were drafted in 2018 by teams in the AFC North. Although Baker Mayfield isn't playing for the Cleveland Browns anymore, he would love to get another win over the Baltimore Ravens. So far in his career, Mayfield has had a record of 3-5 versus the Ravens. Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens are the firm favorites heading into this game, and it will be tough for Mayfield to come away with a positive result. This will be Mayfield's first game back as the starting quarterback for the Panthers since he got injured.     NFL Rookie Watch@NFLRookieWatxh2018 QB Draft Class:1. Baker Mayfield: 104 TOT TD3.

He has a passer rating of 93.7 for 1,768 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions in 9 games this season. He has also rushed for 635 yards and two touchdowns this season.

75,Teddy Bridgewater,"[""NFL Trade Rumors: Should the Houston Texans pursue Teddy Bridgewater?  The Carolina Panthers have been the most talked-about team when it comes to landing Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson. With the recent lawsuits that have been placed against Watson, it's going to be tough to get him at the moment. Deshaun Watson has made it known that he has no problem sitting out until the Texans trade him.  Houston recently added former Los Angeles Chargers back-up quarterback Tyrod Taylor, but it's hard to believe the Texans will enter the 2021-2022 NFL season with him as their starting quarterback. Instead of the Panthers pursuing the Texans starting quarterback, Houston would be wise to pursue Teddy Bridgewater to start while Watson sits.                   NFL Trade Rumors: How does Teddy Bridgewater help the Houston Texans? Carolina Panthers QB Teddy Bridgewater could help the Houston Texans The Carolina Panthers are projected to select a quarterback with their eighth overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. They have expressed interest in moving their current starting quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. The Houston Texans need help at quarterback and this trade makes the most sense. Panthers send: Teddy Bridgewater, 8th overall, 40th overall, 2022 1st, 2022 2nd, 2023 1st, 2023 3rdTexans send: Deshaun WatsonTexans get a starting caliber QB, boatload of picks and prime position for first overall in 2022Panthers get their guyüòç‚Äî Brandon Coyle / NFL Draft (@CoyleNfl) March 17, 2021     Teddy Bridgewater plays his best football when the spotlight is not on him. He struggles when the weight of a franchise is on his shoulders. When he started for the New Orleans Saints in 2019, Bridgewater went (5-0) as a starter. Back then, there was no question that Bridgewater was a temporary starter until Drew Brees returned from injury. His performance in the 2019-2020 NFL season landed him a big payday with Carolina, and Bridgewater held the weight of the Carolina Panthers franchise on his shoulders. They finished the 2020-2021 NFL season with a (4-11) record. If the Houston Texans pursue Teddy Bridgewater through a trade, they could be getting the same version of Bridgewater that played for New Orleans. The Texans have made it known that Deshaun Watson is their quarterback and that is not changing. This will take the spotlight off of Bridgewater. With the QB trade market heating up, here's where we think the top QBs end up:Deshaun Watson: #Panthers Russell Wilson: #Seahawks Carson Wentz: #Colts Sam Darnold: #WashingtonFootballDerek Carr: #Raiders Marcus Mariota: #49ers Teddy Bridgewater: #Texans Jimmy G: #Patriots‚Äî Turfside Talk (@TurfsideTalk) February 12, 2021     Teddy Bridgewater has the skill set to be a successful starting quarterback. He showed that with the Minnesota Vikings in 2015 when he finished with an (11-5) record. The Houston Texans will be getting a quarterback that will take a lot of risks. Outside of his rookie year and last season, Teddy Bridgwater doesn't turn the football over often. With all the issues surrounding Deshaun Watson, it only makes sense for the Houston Texans to find a temporary replacement. Teddy Bridgewater is the perfect temporary replacement for Watson for the 2021-2022 NFL season.     "", ""3 observations from Denver Broncos vs Seattle Seahawks  The Denver Broncos once again had a strong offensive showing in the preseason, winning 30-3 against the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday.  Perhaps the most important thing to happen over the course of the game was the fact that it became clear who should be the starting quarterback for the Broncos. If everything was pointing to the battle being very tight, Saturday's game made it clear that the competition has a winner.        On that note, here are three key observations after the Broncos-Seahawks game:           #1 It's Teddy's team If the quarterback battle was tight, Bridgewater's performance on Saturday all but helped him lock his spot as the Broncos' starter for week 1. With so much talent along the offense, Bridgewater doesn't really need to elevate the group so much but execute it well, and that's exactly what he's doing to show Vic Fangio that he should be the starter. Teddy Bridgewater‚Äôs preseason line to date:16-of-19 (84.2 pct.)179 yards9.42 YPA2 TD passes0 INTRating: 141.0Drive results:FGTDTDTDPoints per possession: 6.0 (!)‚Äî Andrew Mason (@MaseDenver) August 22, 2021     Bridgewater completed nine passes out of 11 attempts, threw a touchdown and seemed much more comfortable than Lock, his opponent for the starting job. He's also more experienced, and has at least proven himself capable of taking a team to the playoffs. When week 1 arrives, Bridgewater will be QB1.  #2 Seahawks' revamped pass rush makes this team a threat Denver Broncos vs Seattle Seahawks Seattle did a good job fixing one of the team's main weaknesses this past offseason, as the pass rush now can actually pressure opposing quarterbacks and not rely on Jamal Adams to do so.     Two sacks isn't a huge number by any means, but the pressure was there all night long, and both Teddy Bridgewater and Drew Lock had problems dealing with the Seahawks' defense. Yes, Denver's offensive line is not an amazing group, but they still would have won this matchup fairly easily last year. But not in 2021.  #3 Seahawks got what they paid for in the secondary Shaquil Griffin is not a superstar, but he's still a solid corner to play in the league, and he was the best cornerback in the Seahawks' roster over the last couple of years.

He suffered in coverage against Jerry Jeudy, and after four uninspiring years with the San Francisco 49ers, there's not much to be excited about with the prospect of him being the main cornerback for the Seattle Seahawks.     "", 'Colin Cowherd feels Cooper Rush isn\'t far away from Dak Prescott as Cowboys QB1  Backup quarterback Cooper Rush, who has filled in for an injured Dak Prescott, led the Dallas Cowboys to a third straight win this season as they defeated their division rivals the Washington Commanders in Week 4 by 25-10.  Rush is now 4-0 as the Cowboys\' starting quarterback, and he has kept the team afloat in the absence of Prescott, who suffered a thumb injury in Week 1 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.                     Following another great performance from Cooper Rush, Colin Cowherd is confident that the Cowboys have two QB1s as the gap between Dak Prescott and Cooper Rush is not that big. Here\'s what Cowherd said: ""Most people aren\'t saying Cooper Rush is Dak Prescott, but he\'s won four straight starts. Okay, right. Teddy Bridgewater. won five straight starts for the saints as a backup. Why? Because Teddy Bridgewater is an arguable starter. He\'s a low end starter or a great backup. Cooper Rush is a great backup. Or perhaps he\'s a low end starter.""     Colin Cowherd added: ""Well, most of us and most people I know in the league consider Dak Prescott, a middle of the pack starter. So Dak is better than Cooper rush. But it\'s not a huge gap."" Cowherd continued: ""If you put Dak on the field going up against Cooper rush, Dak better, a little better. And that\'s why paying him $40 million is sort of a cautionary tale on what happens when you don\'t have a quarterback that can elevate others..."" ESPN@espn4-0  Cooper Rush becomes the first QB in Cowboys history to win each of his first four career starts.179551313     Although Dak Prescott is better than Cooper Rush on paper, the backup quarterback has certainly raised his value to the franchise. There might be other teams as well who might look to get Rush, as he has arguably played better than many quarterbacks in the league.  Dak Prescott is expected to make his much-awaited return against the Los Angeles Rams next week Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Dallas Cowboys     Barring any late setbacks, Prescott is scheduled to make his return from injury next week against the Los Angeles Rams. It is certainly not the most ideal game for him to make his return as the Rams will possess a tough challenge for the Cowboys. In his absence, the Cowboys have won all three games, and now Prescott will be making his return against the reigning Super Bowl champs. Pickswise@PickswiseDak Prescott watching Cooper Rush go 3-0 as a starting QB:4001555 Following the game against the Rams, the Cowboys will face the high-flying Eagles, and there is a high possibility that Prescott could be under pressure if he doesn\'t get a positive result in either of those games.

During their Week 3 victory over the Buffalo Bills, he suffered a back injury that looked like it was a head injury. Four days later, in their Thursday night game vs. the Cincinnati Bengals, he got slammed to the ground and hit his head, which resulted in a concussion.        ESPN analyst Marcus Spears passionately spoke about how head coach Mike McDaniel and the team failed to handle Tua Tagovailoa\'s injury situation.           Spears said: ""Mike McDaniel, he just don\'t need to talk about it - that\'s number one. He said the wrong things, \'I would never put a guy out there.\' Guys go out in games playing hurt all the time, that\'s a lie."" Spears added that he thinks it was a mistake by the Dolphins to allow the quarterback to play on Thursday night. He added: ""If you went back and saw and reviewed the film of the Buffalo Bills game, it ain\'t no way in hell Tua should have played Thursday vs. the Bengals."" Spears wasn\'t the only analyst to criticize the Dolphins coaching staff surrounding the situation. The dangers regarding concussions have prompted pundits all around the league to lift their opinion on the situation.          Teddy Bridgewater will start Sunday as Tua Tagovailoa has been ruled out vs. New York Jets New York Jets v Miami Dolphins     Quarterback Teddy Bridgewater will get the start for the Miami Dolphins Sunday vs. the New York Jets.    This is set to be the first game of the season that Tagovailoa will miss. Bridgewater stepped in for the starter during Thursday night\'s loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. Bridgewater had a decent performance, throwing 14-23, with 193 yards, a touchdown and an interception. He\'ll have his work cut out for him in Week 5 though. The Jets are coming off an impressive 24-20 win over Mike Tomlin\'s Pittsburgh Steelers. Starting quarterback Zach Wilson is back from injury to lead Robert Saleh\'s offense.

Happy New Year to our entire readership, let\'s cast an eye over the key stats heading into the final day in the NFC South.  Carolina Panthers vs New Orleans Saints Head-To-Head The Saints and the Panthers have met each other 52 times (including a post-season game). The New Orleans Saints have won 27 games and the Carolina Panthers wave won 25 games.

With this week done with, the next time football is played it will count towards someone's Super Bowl run.   Before bidding au revoir to the preseason, here's a look back at the biggest winners and losers of the week.        Winners and losers from the NFL preseason finale            Winners Kenny Yeboah, WR, New York Jets Entering the weekend, few were familiar with Yeboah. Exiting the weekend, Yeboah is the man of the hour.  Late in the Jets' game against the Philadelphia Eagles, they needed a miracle to tie the game. Yeboah ended up being at the center of the comeback. He caught four passes for 100 yards and two touchdowns, including a buzzer-beater Hail Mary that tied the game.  In the final fifteen minutes, Yeboah solidified himself on a roster somewhere, even if it isn't with the New York Jets. Sam Darnold, QB, Carolina Panthers Sam Darnold is one of the least hyped quarterbacks in the NFL going into 2021. However, he took a step towards proving the world wrong over the weekend.  After a slow start, Darnold finished the day by completing 19 of 25 passes for 162 yards and two touchdowns. If Darnold can keep that going, the Panthers may hang around longer than many expect this year.     Sam Darnold to Jets fans after he drops 400 on them in Week 1. pic.twitter.com/ejOBuKZaKM‚Äî Cat Crave (@CatCraveBlog) August 23, 2021  Trevor Lawrence, QB, Jacksonville Jaguars While it is too early to call Lawrence a bust in the NFL, after last week's performance against the Saints, he needed to bounce back this week.  Lawrence stepped up to the plate and delivered a great performance, completing almost every pass and slicing through the defense en route to two touchdowns and no interceptions. Losers  Denver Broncos One week after naming Teddy Bridgewater the starter, Broncos fans were anxious to see how Bridgewater would respond in the next game. After starting one for five, Bridgewater didn't inspire much confidence. To make matters worse, the Broncos' first team found themselves down to the Rams' second team early in the game.     While the Broncos were able to bounce back with a touchdown on Bridgewater's final drive, the sight of losing to backups leaves plenty expecting a rough NFL season for Denver. Above all, the game was a dose of reality after beating down two other second-team squads in previous weeks and served as a potential preview of the grind to come. Los Angeles Rams v Denver Broncos  Daniel Jones, QB, New York Giants Heading into 2021, Daniel Jones has his NFL career in his hands. The Giants have recruited more weapons and Saquon Barkley is back. Jones is out of excuses. If the Giants don't make some noise this year, they will be looking for Jones' replacement in the NFL Draft this year.         Unfortunately for Jones, his performance in this week's game channeled the Jones of 2020. For everything he did right in completing 17 of 22 pass attempts, he undid everything with his redzone interception. Rolling to his right, Jones fired into a sea of Patriots and the result was a turnover. If Jones plays like this in 2021, this will be his last year as a starter. Panthers' kicking game While the Panthers were able to beat expectations at the quarterback position, their kicking game looks to be in trouble. Joey Slye missed his only field goal attempt and while Ryan Santoso made both of his, he nearly missed one of the field goals.     Carolina Panthers v Los Angeles Chargers Even if Sam Darnold can beat expectations and get the Panthers within a few points of winning, the Panthers' kickers could sink the ship, going by their showing in Week 3.JK DobbinsThis is why more NFL coaches are keeping their starters out of the NFL preseason.

In doing so, Roethlisberger also ensured he'll be returning to the fold in the Steel City come September 9th as the starting quarterback. But after 16 fantastic years in the NFL, it's hard to imagine that Roethlisberger has too many more championship-caliber years left in him.        Currently, Mason Rudolph is the Steelers' backup quarterback. If you happened to catch his 2019 performances when filling in for the injured Roethlisberger, then you'll already know they fell beneath the high standards expected in Pittsburgh.           The experience may have aided his progression. But, personally, I don't think Rudolph is the solution in the long term. This of course begs the question of who Roethlisberger's successor will eventually be? Let's take a look. Five potential replacements for Ben Roethlisberger The Steelers have signed Ben Roethlisberger to a new contract, per @RapSheet 24th highest-graded QB in 2020 (69.0) pic.twitter.com/DQMUUJ4mEK‚Äî PFF (@PFF) March 4, 2021     #1 - Marcus Mariota (Las Vegas Raiders) Marcus Mariota 2014 Heisman Award-winning QB Marcus Mariota has struggled to live up to expectations in his NFL career. In Tennessee, his abilities seemed to wane year on year and it was no surprise to see him moved on to the Las Vegas Raiders during the 2020 offseason. Mariota has been back up to Derek Carr ever since. That being said, there are two reasons why this signing could work for the Steelers. First, Mariota is out of contract at the end of the 2021 season and has enough experience under his belt to come in and do a job and second, in the one-game viewers really got to see off Mariota last season, he performed quite well.         This performance does suggest that coach Gruden's influence on one of the best college players of all time has been paying off. Besides which, if all else fails, Mariota can simply keep the passing game simple and hand the ball off to Najee Harris, who looks destined to have a tremendous career in the NFL. #2 - Carson Strong (Nevada)        Of all the quarterbacks I've seen this week in preparation for next year's 2022 NFL draft, the Nevada Wolf Pack's signal-caller Carson Strong is certainly the closest to Roethlisberger's style of play. He is potentially a college talent that the Steelers will keep an eye on. Like Roethlisberger, Strong is a traditional pocket-passer blessed with a gun of an arm, accurate delivery, and, at 6-foot-4, a real presence behind the line. Of course, the Steelers could vouch for a host of other quarterbacks in next year's draft. But with 5,193 yards, 38 TDs and just 11 picks in his first two campaigns as a starter in Nevada, Mike Tomlin and co. could do a lot worse than Carson Strong in their quest to replace Roethlisberger. #3 - Drew Lock or Teddy Bridgewater (Denver Broncos) Denver Broncos v Atlanta Falcons     With Drew Lock now vying with the former-Panther, Teddy Bridgewater, for quarterback supremacy in Denver. One of the two signal-callers will likely be deemed surplus to requirements come the 2022 offseason. Teddy Bridgewater threw for 3,733 passing yards, 15 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for Carolina in 2020. Drew Lock managed 2,933 passing yards, 16 touchdowns and 15 picks for the Broncos. With those stats, neither player is likely to pacify a Steelers fanbase used to watching such talents as Terry Bradshaw and Ben Roethlisberger at Heinz Field. But both would be decent stop-gap options if coach Tomlin and GM Kevin Colbert feel there isn't value for them in the 2022 NFL draft. #4 - Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers) Aaron Rodgers is reportedly not happy with the Packers and he has told the organization he does not want to return to the team, per @AdamSchefter Rodgers: PFF's highest-graded player in 2020 (95.1) pic.twitter.com/xTHVEAlZBF‚Äî PFF (@PFF) April 29, 2021     Aaron Rodgers wants out of Green Bay. The Pittsburgh Steelers franchise is one of the most renowned and storied in sports. If the quarterback is granted his wish, I'd expect to see the Steelers sniffing around for the 2020 NFL MVP and the quarterback reciprocating the interest. It probably won't happen, but the Steelers have as good a chance as any other team of persuading Rodgers to join their ranks and, of course, he'd be an excellent replacement for Roethlisberger. #5 - Mitchell Trubisky (Buffalo Bills) Mitchell Trubisky: 63.5 PFF Grade in 2020T-32nd among QBs pic.twitter.com/6eOYBFqsJ6‚Äî PFF (@PFF) March 18, 2021     Bear with me here. For all the hate he receives for not being Patrick Mahomes, Mitchell Trubisky has still thrown almost twice as many touchdowns as he has interceptions in his short career. He's been to the playoffs twice and he's young enough to improve further whilst learning a more dynamic style of offense under Sean McDermott and Brian Daboll at the Bills training center. And who knows what kind of tricks he'll pick up from Josh Allen over in Buffalo, too. Like my first pick Marcus Mariota, I just don't think Trubisky is over and done with in the NFL just yet. Someone will give him another opportunity, so why not the Steelers next year if Roethlisberger retires?Trubisky lining up alongside RB Najee Harris, WRs JuJu Smith-Schuster, Chase Claypool and Diontae Johnson doesn't sound all that bad to me.Plus, it's not like Roethlisberger didn't have a nightmare season back in 2006 (18 touchdowns, 23 interceptions). Players can improve, and Trubisky deserves another shot.     Also Read: Who is Ben Roethlisberger's Wife, Ashley Harlan?      "", '5 NFL teams that could be looking for a new head coach  Ah, the NFL.

Rhule is only in his second year as the Panthers\' head coach. There is an unwritten gridiron rule that often says a coach in power gets three to establish himself within an organization, but owners are now less patient.

They now look destined to miss out on the playoffs once more. Nagy has a decent-sized bargaining chip in the form of Justin Fields. But Chicago\'s lack of progress after a showstopping season is troubling to say the least. Stefanski\'s lack of progress with Baker Mayfield could force Cleveland\'s hand (Photo: Getty)     -Cleveland Browns At first glance, Kevin Stefanski seems like the type of guy that could go a few years without buying a drink in Cleveland. After all, he has played a role in ending the Browns\' seemingly endless streak of NFL futility and even got them a win over a divisional rival in the Wild Card round. But there\'s no doubt that the Browns, currently trapped in an AFC logjam of mediocrity, have been one of the league\'s most disappointing teams, having done little to earn their plethora of national television appearances. Baker Mayfield\'s regression under center has likewise done little to instill long-term faith in the former Minnesota offensive coordinator. Cleveland enjoyed a taste of NFL success last season and it\'s easy to become addicted. Could Stefanski become a victim? The Giants have made little progress under two years of Joe Judge (Photo: Getty)     -New York Giants When not hitting home runs over the summer, New York sports fans are cursing the name of \'Judge\' in the fall. The Giants, fully trapped in a dangerous cycle of NFL futility that\'s usually reserved for their green MetLife Stadium brethren, have made little progress over the last two seasons. If the Giants were to let Judge go, they would hire their third different coach over five seasons. Sure, there\'s something to be said about continuity in coaching, but is this type of football worth continuing? Losing the services of Russell Wilson doomed Seattle to the bottom of the NFL standings (Photo: Getty)     -Seattle Seahawks Carroll\'s 2021 endeavors carry a large asterisk: his Seahawks lost Russell Wilson for several games due to a rare injury that has sunk them to the bottom of a competitive NFC West. How Seattle looked without Wilson was bad enough. But their defensive efforts make the Legion of Boom feel like a distant memory and the struggles don\'t even come with the comfort of a high draft pick (which was dealt to the New York Jets in exchange for safety Jamal Adams). Seattle is on pace for its first losing season since 2011 (Carroll\'s second year at the helm) and a potential rebuild with Wilson may be unlikely as he may enter free agency. It\'s possible the Seahawks could look for a change at the top.

They traded a third-round pick and tight end Hunter Long to the Los Angeles Rams for All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey. In doing so, they have created a formidable cornerback tandem with All-Pro Xavien Howard.        Miami Dolphins signings           Malik Reed celebrates sacking Tom Brady - Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Pittsburgh Steelers One notable signing was linebacker Malik Reed on a one-year deal, who will provide depth and rotational pass-rushing ability. While his production has tapered off since his eight-sack performance in 2020, Reed was at his best playing under the Dolphins' current defensive coordinator, Vic Fangio in Denver. They also signed punter Jake Bailey on a one-year deal to improve their special teams unit. Bailey, a former All-Pro, has the potential to be one of the best punters in the league, but his numbers declined a bit after his All-Pro season and a back injury limited him to nine games in 2022.     Wide receivers River Cracraft and Braxton Berrios also joined the team on one-year deals. Cracraft‚Äôs little-used slot option last season provided veteran leadership in the wide receivers room, while Berrios is expected to fill the starting slot role and upgrade the return game. Miami also signed guard Dan Feeney, offensive tackle Kendall Lamm, cornerback Nik Needham, tight end Eric Saubert, running back Myles Gaskin, safety DeShon Elliott, linebackers Duke Riley and David Long Jr. on various deals. If Long Jr. can get over his injury issues, he will prove to be a bargain for $11m over 2 years. One of the most significant signings was that of running back Raheem Mostert, who agreed to a two-year deal. He was the team's leading rusher in 2022 and is expected to be the starter for a second straight year. Jeff Wilson Jr. will also be returning to the running back room. NFL@NFLRaheem Mostert is running it back with the Dolphins. @RMos_8Ball | @MiamiDolphins2525192     Lastly, the Dolphins signed former New York Jets quarterback Mike White to a two-year deal worth up to $16 million to fill the backup quarterback role. With Tua Tagovailoa's injury history, White is a high-end backup who can carry the offense for a game or two, providing necessary depth and insurance. Notable Miami Dolphins departures Mike Gesicki celebrates a touchdown - AFC Wild Card Playoffs - Miami Dolphins v Buffalo Bills Tight end Mike Gesicki's departure was likely the biggest, however, as he lost his starting role in Mike McDaniels' offense he may not be missed as much as expected.     Byron Jones' release was expected after his injury plagued runs in Miami, and the trade for Ramsey instantly upgraded the secondary. Other notable names include linebacker Elandon Roberts, defensive end Melvin Ingram, safety Eric Rown, and backup quarterback Teddy Bridgewater.Overall, the Dolphins' offseason moves have addressed several areas of need and added depth and talent to the team, providing a solid foundation for the upcoming season. While some signings come with certain risks, the majority of the moves represent low-risk, high-reward propositions for Miami.     ""]"
76,Mac Jones,"['NFL fans brutally troll Mac Jones and Zach Wilson for Patriots-Jets performance  As far as quarterback performances go, Zach Wilson and Mac Jones\' on Sunday was subpar to say the least.

But for all the excitement that the last-second return gave, the performances of Jones and Wilson have not gone unnoticed. It was flat-out poor.

Zach Wilson poor as Jets lose to Patriots Buffalo Bills v New York Jets     The Patriots added a win to their record and at the end of the day, that is all that matters. The game against the Jets will not be remembered too fondly, but at least the Patriots won a division game and improved to 6-4 on the season. Jones was rather efficient in the win, completing 23 of his 27 passes for 246 yards. The running game was solid enough with Damien Harris (8 carries, 65 yards) as the standout on the day. Running back Rhamondre Stevenson was New England\'s best receiver (6 receptions, 56 yards) and that says something. New England Patriots@PatriotsDIVISION DUB 41241139     For the Jets, Zach Wilson will look back at this game and certainly not see it as his best. Wilson completed just nine of his 22 passes for 77 yards and the Jets‚Äô running game was basically non-existent as they could only manage 59 rushing yards. Both teams were poor on third-down conversions, completing just seven of 29 combined. Another stat that popped out was that there was 17 punts in the game, with the Jets accounting for 10 of those. NFL@NFLMarcus Jones had Gillette in a frenzy.  @Patriots1837425This game will be forgotten rather quickly and rightly so, but for Bill Belichick and his Patriots team, a win is a win and it doesn\'t matter how you get it.

It was an ordeal for Mac Jones as he completed 22 of 32 passes for 321 yards but threw three interceptions. His night only got worse as, with a couple of minutes left to play, he suffered a leg injury.            Further tests are required to understand the exact nature of the injury, but there appear to be fears that it could be tendon or ligament damage. That did not show up on the preliminary X-Ray done today, but more details are expected after further medical testing on Monday.

Beyond the Monster@BeyondtheMnstrMac Jones hobbling off the field. #Patriots ‚Ä¢ #ForeverNE 5     Mac Jones has an excellent injury record and durability, but there will be concerns that he has previously been injured in college while playing for the University of Alabama and in the Senior Bowl. He initially suffered a bone bruise in 2021 while in Alabama, but it did not lead to any missed snaps. In the second case, he injured both ankles and was forced to miss the game altogether. Last year, he did not have any injury problems behind a steady offensive line and started all 17 regular season games. The extent of the injury, as highlighted before, is not known, but there is a good chance that he may miss 2-4 weeks, including the New England Patriots' next game against the Green Bay Packers. In such circumstances, they would have to rely on either Brian Hoyer or rookie Bailey Zappe.    Losing Mac Jones would be a huge blow to Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots. Even though it is early in the season, they have begun it 1-2 after their latest loss and sit fourth in the AFC East. The offense was already stuttering as they scored only 17 points in their solitary win against the equally uninspiring Pittsburgh Steelers, but if Jones were to miss a major chunk of the season, it would only go uphill from here.     "", 'Peyton Manning on Mac Jones NFL success  Mac Jones has been quite the surprise after being the last quarterback selected of the ""big five"" in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft. Not only has the league taken notice, but so has one of the best quarterbacks to ever play the game.  Hall of Fame quarterback and two-time Super Bowl champion Peyton Manning seems to really enjoy breaking down film. He recently looked at New England Patriots rookie quarterback Mac Jones and the success he has had so far this season.        Manning\'s study of Jones on film showed the incredible playmaker that the rookie has developed into and how he is able to get out of certain situations to find success so early in his career.

Manning recently studied film on New England Patriots rookie quarterback Mac Jones. Jones and the Patriots are currently 7-4 tied with the Buffalo Bills at the top of the AFC East. Manning looked at film from the Patriots\' dominant win over the Cleveland Browns in Week 10.     Manning saw how Jones was able to get a touchdown pass to Kendrick Bourne, and while it looked quite impressive, he said that there were things that Jones could have done better. He stated that Jones needed to control the Browns defense with his eyes better, something that you hear a lot of quarterbacks trying to do. ""He should\'ve been looking to the right knowing he\'s gonna throw this seam route the whole time"" Peyton Manning then showed where Mac Jones saw the Browns show a blitz, and he immediately called an audible. Right before the ball was snapped, Jones realized that the Browns weren\'t going to blitz. He then changed the play back to what was originally called. Manning showed a lot of praise for the rookie for having the acumen to understand what the opposing defense was doing. The Patriots were able to pick up a big gain on the play.     New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick obviously saw Mac Jones\' ability to be in a pro-style offense when he was at Alabama, which led them to not only drafting him in the first round but also starting him Week 1.The Patriots had another dominant win over the Atlanta Falcons last Thursday night to extend their win streak to five games. The Patriots are now gearing up to host the Tennessee Titans this Thursday night.Also Read: Who are Peyton Manning\'s kids?     ', ""Does Bill Belichick trust Mac Jones more than Tom Brady?  Bill Belichick had the final say with Tom Brady and he has the final say with Mac Jones. If he wanted to effectively keep one of the quarterbacks out of the game plan, he could do it with a snap of his fingers.   So, after Mac Jones' three-pass performance on Monday Night Football, it's fair to ask how much he trusts Mac Jones in his rookie season.        How much does this compare to how he used Brady back in his first season as a starter?           Jones vs Brady: Who has/had more trust with Belichick? Tennessee Titans v New England Patriots Tom Brady's case Tom Brady never had a game in which he threw three passes. The game that saw him throw the least passes in his first season was in his first game in which he completed five of ten passes in a 3-10 loss to the New York Jets.      In a Week 14 game against the Buffalo Bills that same year, Brady threw 35 times. Of course, the circumstances with the weather and playoff positioning were different.  The stakes weren't as high.

But if one compares both quarterbacks' first seasons in the NFL, it is a very different story. Mac Jones' case Tom Brady didn't play in his first season with Belichick. As such, it was a clear indication that Brady wasn't yet trusted to step on the field.      Meanwhile, Mac Jones is already 13 games into his NFL career. Bill Belichick cut ties with Cam Newton to give Jones more playing time. Zack Cox@ZackCoxNESNMac Jones is bundled up tonight. Full hood underneath his helmet.4:27 AM ¬∑ Dec 6, 202155240 Based on this alone, one could say that Mac Jones is much more trusted than Tom Brady was at the same point in their careers. Additionally, based on what Bill Belichick said after the Bills game in which Jones threw three times, it is clear that the weather was the leading factor behind the decision.      According to Patriots Wire, had they had to throw, they would have. ‚ÄúAgain, I think if it had been a different type of game and we would have needed to throw there in the fourth quarter then we would have thrown,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe were able to manage the game the way we did and that worked out all right for us.‚Äù Who has more trust? Mac Jones clearly earned more trust with Bill Belichick than Brady did in 2000. Brady threw three times in his rookie season.  Jones has thrown 384 times with plenty of games to play. Based on this metric alone, Jones has more trust and is on pace to throw more passes by the end of the season compared to Tom Brady.    Brady threw 413 passes in 2001. Jones has thrown 384 passes in 13 games. Jones could pass him in the Patriots' next game. Put simply, Jones has much more trust than Brady at this point in their respective careers.     "", ""Why did Mac Jones scream at Matt Patricia? Patriots QB yells in frustration at OC during loss vs. Bills  New England Patriots quarterback Mac Jones' frustration boiled over during his team's loss against division rivals Buffalo Bills on Thursday Night football.  Down by 17 points with less than two minutes left in the game, the Patriots opted to kick a 39-yard field goal on fourth-and-goal instead of trying to score a touchdown. Jones was visibly frustrated by the Patriots' offensive play-calling and seemingly took it out on co-ordinator Matt Patricia, yelling:        ‚ÄúThrow the f**king ball! F**king running game sucks!‚Äù           Barstool Sports@barstoolsports‚ÄúThrow the fucking ball! The running game sucks!‚Äù Mac Jones has had enough of Matt Patricia332682712 While the broadcast showed Jones yelling on the sidelines after the Patriots' field goal attempt, the timing of his outburst is still unclear. The Patriots called a pass on their final 16 plays of the game. Mac Jones attempted 15 passes and scrambled for a five-yard run after the pocket collapsed. It's also possible that Patricia called for a running play, but Jones called an audible at the line of scrimmage. Perhaps he refused to adhere to the play calls before voicing his frustration at the end of the drive.     Mac Jones was right about the Patriots' running game. New England ran the ball 14 times for 60 yards, the second-fewest they have managed in a game this season. Overall, the Patriots offense could muster only 255 yards of offense, a terrible performance against one of the best teams in the league. The dismal performance had fans demanding that the team fire Matt Patricia. Will Mac Jones and the New England Patriots make it to the playoffs? The defeat against the Bills tonight saw the Patriots drop to 6-6 for the season. They are 1.5 games behind the 7-4 Cincinnati Bengals, who currently occupy the seventh and final spot in the AFC playoff picture. The Patriots' playoff odds are currently less than 25% currently. Dustin Baker@DustBakerTonight's game is a big damn deal for those who care about the AFC East. Bills Odds to Win Division: Current = 57% Win over NE = 70% Loss to NE = 36%Patriots Odds to Reach Playoffs: Current = 38% Win over BUF = 60% Loss to BUF = 24%24     New England will have to win four out of their remaining five games to stand a chance of making it to the playoffs. They will have to beat the Bengals to ensure they hold the tiebreaker. Their other four games will see them take on the Miami Dolphins, Arizona Cardinals, Las Vegas Raiders, and the Bills. It's a tough schedule and a tall order for the Patriots.The margin for error is virtually non-existent for New England. If they secure four wins in their remaining five games, they could have a chance. But it's highly unlikely that New England will be in the postseason at the end of the year.     "", '2022 NFL Draft: Where would Mac Jones rank amongst top QB prospects this year?  With the 2022 NFL Draft approaching, franchises are posturing to find the next generational talent at each position. At quarterback, several potential cornerstones will be eligible and likely selected in the first go-round through the 32 franchises. The most pressing needs under center are for teams like the Carolina Panthers, Houston Texans, and Seattle Seahawks. Every team can be reflective and figure out whether their guy is \'the\' guy moving forward.  The New England Patriots lost their generational quarterback Tom Brady. They had a transitional year with Cam Newton in 2020, setting up the parting of the red seas for Alabama alum Mac Jones. With the Crimson Tide, Jones won the National Championship in 2020, leading the offense for a team so historically dominant due to their defensive studs and skill position powerhouses.        After an initial period of adjusting to Bill Belichick\'s offense, Mac Jones was off and running in 2021, eventually amassing a collection of two 300-yard passing performances and one 299-yard game. New England finished 10-7, with Jones\' merit as a Wild Card round merit being proven.           Unfortunately, the Patriots were less than convincing in a four-score blowout loss against the Buffalo Bills in the first round of this past season\'s postseason. While it doesn\'t beg the question, it certainly makes one wonder about the long-term health of football\'s most important position. Mac Jones would be in a similar draft position at QB in 2022 if he were drafted this year instead of last The NFL Draft has two players (Malik Willis and Kenny Pickett) that will undoubtedly garner attention in the top 10 picks. A third, Matt Corral, would be in the same boat if a Sugar Bowl injury didn\'t complicate things.     Like last year, Mac Jones is solidly the fourth or fifth-best player on the big draft board. His ceiling will only go as high as Belichick\'s, but the trio, as mentioned earlier, could arguably move the needle more when they hit the NFL gridiron this coming season. NFL executives are weighing in and hurling superlatives at the 2022 NFL Draft quarterbacks. According to Tom Pelissero for NFL.com, an AFC general manager called Malik Willis a top potential quarterback in this year\'s class: ""To me, he\'s the No. 1 guy in the class. And for whatever people want to talk about in terms of readiness or all this other stuff ‚Äî it was the same thing with Josh Allen, it was the same thing with Patrick Mahomes. I think people are a little short-sighted with that kid."" Here\'s how an AFC executive described Pickett:     ""Just his demeanor, coming away from center, how he handled everything, Pickett was the most impressive. He was the biggest guy, strongest stature ‚Äî he just felt like a quarterback."" No one ever viewed Mac Jones this way, even when he was winning a title at Alabama during the COVID-19 pandemic season. Matt Corral, Sam Howell, and Desmond Ritter showed more coming into this season and could leave Jones in the dust like a pro with a higher ceiling than the Patriots gunslinger.Only time can settle this debate, but Jones measures as merely average when juxtaposed against the QB elites of this year and last year.

Cam Newton is a veteran with experience, and Mac Jones is a rookie who could benefit from a year off. Mac Jones had the better preseason, but is that something Belichick will trust? It's hard to judge a rookie's success in the preseason when they're playing against backups.     The Patriots quarterback situation has a familiar feel to it. Cam Newton is the safe choice to start at quarterback for the Patriots. If Newton begins to struggle, the Patriots will not hesitate to put Jones in the game. Let's not forget that Brady only appeared in one game during his rookie season before becoming the starter after Bledsoe's injury. Cam Newton feels like Drew Bledsoe, and Mac Jones feels like Tom Brady. Obviously, Mac Jones isn't anywhere near Tom Brady talent-wise, but his situation is similar to that of an young Brady. The longer Bill Belichick takes on making a quarterback decision, the better it looks for Cam Newton. Belichick will likely keep Newton as the starting quarterback. Mac Jones will follow in Brady's footsteps to take over the Patriots during his second season in the NFL.The Patriots can only hope that Cam Newton can stay healthy, and when Jones takes over, he can bring the same success as Tom Brady.

(via @nflfilms)8:30 AM ¬∑ Feb 8, 20223259332           Mac Jones accomplishes what Patrick Mahomes tried 8 times to do Mahomes claimed that he tried 8 times to ‚ÄúGriddy‚Äù (a celebratory touchdown dance invented by LSU‚Äôs Allen Davis), but he could not figure it out. Instead, the Kansas City Chiefs‚Äô star quarterback urged Mac Jones to do the dance if he ever finds himself in the end zone. Moments later, as seen in the clip, Jones breaks through a broken play and keeps on running even though the play was whistled dead. With no opposing player in sight and plenty of turf between him and the end zone, Jones eventually crosses into the end zone and does the Griddy.     As far as it goes for unofficial touchdown celebrations that did not actually result in any scored points, Jones\' performance of the Griddy delighted the fans in attendance at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. The AFC beat the NFC 41-35 in the Pro Bowl for the 5th straight year. Mac Jones completed 12 out of 16 passes for 112 yards with 1 touchdown pass and 1 interception. Officially, Jones ran 5 times for 2 yards. Unofficially, he ran like Forrest Gump down the field untouched, with no players within 10 yards of him, capped by the Griddy end zone dance. Both Jones and the fictional movie character Gump are alums of Alabama University. Regarding the Griddy, it‚Äôs a dance that spread throughout the NFL this season. Notable players utilizing the celebratory touchdown dance this season include wide receivers (and LSU alums) Justin Jefferson and Ja\'Marr Chase, as well as running back (and LSU alum) Clyde Edwards-Helaire.         As for Patrick Mahomes, the former league and Super Bowl MVP threw for 53 yards, completing 5 out of 10 passes.Mahomes is enjoying his offseason as the Chiefs look to reload for another run at the Super Bowl next season. Jones and the New England Patriots will look to do the same after both teams were eliminated from the playoffs.     ', ""Patriots fans slam officiating crew for performance vs. Vikings on Thanksgiving Day  The Minnesota Vikings and New England Patriots served a delicious finale in the NFL's Week 12 tripleheader on Thanksgiving Day on Thursday. The back-and-forth game had plenty of action and talking points, as neither team allowed the other to build a lead of more than one score. In the end, the Vikings won 33-26, largely due to some outstanding catches from Justin Jefferson. They improved to a 9-2 record.  While the game was terrific, it was overshadowed by some debatable calls from the officiating crew. The Patriots were on the receiving end of some questionable calls, particularly Hunter Henry's touchdown catch, which was chalked off as an incomplete pass.

But on Thanksgiving Day against the Minnesota Vikings, the unit had an awful outing.

77,Daniel Jones,"[""Is Daniel Jones Really Overrated? A Data-Driven Analysis of the Giants QB  New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones has been a topic of much debate among fans and analysts since his NFL entrance in 2019. Some believe that he is a highly talented quarterback with a bright future, while others argue that he is overrated and not worthy of his sixth-overall draft position.  Here, we will look at his performances and stats from his rookie season to this very moment in an attempt to determine his true value.         His league entrance made him the heir apparent to then-Giants quarterback Eli Manning, who was in the latter stages of his career. Jones was poised to take over as the team's starting quarterback and the Giants and fans had high hopes for his future.           NFC Wild Card Playoffs - Daniel Jones Jones played his first game for the Giants in a loss against the Dallas Cowboys when he came in to relieve Manning. He started his first game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and led his team to an 18-point comeback win.     He threw for 336 yards and two touchdowns, and recorded two rushing touchdowns in his debut start. This performance made him the first Giants quarterback to win his first starting game since Scott Brunner in 1980. evin@KayvonOjulariDaniel Jones QB rankings over the past month:EPA/Play: 1stPasser rating: 3rdAdj. EPA: 1stEPA+CPOE Composite: 1stExpected cmp %: 1stCPOE: 5thCmp %: 1stBest QB over the past month? 19745 He became the first NFL rookie quarterback to throw for 350 yards with five touchdowns and no interceptions in a single game in Week 18 of the 2019 season. He accomplished this feat as he led the Giants to an overtime victory over the Washington Redskins.     The game solidified his position as the team's starting quarterback. He finished his rookie season with 3,027 passing yards, 24 passing touchdowns, and two rushing touchdowns. However, he also led the league in fumbles with 18, losing 11 of them. With a 3-9 record in his rookie season, 5-9 in 2020, and 4-7 in 2021, the Giants declined his fifth-year option in his contract. This meant that he was required to prove himself in 2022 to secure a long-term contract with the team. Jones and the Giants, nonetheless, had an impressive start to the 2022 season with a 6-1 record in their first seven games. Their regular season ended with a 9-6-1 record, marking the first winning season of Jones' career, in addition to his first playoff appearance. He had his best regular-season numbers in most categories, except for passing touchdowns. He ended the season with a 67.2% pass completion rate, 3,205 passing yards, and 15 passing touchdowns. Additionally, he rushed for 708 yards and seven touchdowns. This was a solid performance from him and a clear improvement from his previous seasons.      Daniel Jones' magical moment in the sun in the 2022-23 NFL playoffs The Giants signal-caller amassed a lot of praise and comparisons to the league's best in his first playoff appearance, which came against the Minnesota Vikings on Wild Card weekend. He set an NFL record for being the first player to throw for 300+ yards, two passing touchdowns, no picks, and rush for 70 yards in a playoff game. NFC Divisional Playoffs - New York Giants v Philadelphia Eagles     The divisional round game against the Philadelphia Eagles was a different story. The Eagles won the game 38-7. The Giants shot-caller threw for 135 yards and had zero touchdowns, with one interception. It was a poor performance from him, especially coming off a career high. The question on most people's lips is whether or not he is overrated, given the ups and downs of his career. Paul Schwartz@NYPost_SchwartzJoe Schoen on Daniel Jones: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd like Daniel to be here.‚Äù371 Jones will be a free agent in the offseason. However, Giants general manager Joe Schoen said that they are willing to move forward with Jones as they are satisfied with his performance.However, his numbers still raise the question of whether the Giants will offer him a huge contract or if he will still be with the Giants' franchise quarterback.     "", 'Eli Manning shares state of confidence in Daniel Jones ahead of Giants training camp  Eli Manning is well aware of how brutal the New York Giants fan base can be, having spent his entire 16-season career as quarterback of the NFC East franchise. The two-time Super Bowl champion recently discussed where quarterback Daniel Jones stands entering the 2023 NFL season.  Giants fans are known to have extremely polarizing opinions that they aren\'t shy about sharing in a New York market that is famous for keeping players under the microscope.        Manning spent his entire career in this situation and Jones is now in the position that the two-time Super Bowl MVP once held.           Manning praised Jones for the way he\'s handled the spotlight so far and expressed confidence in the 26-year-old\'s ability to develop his game. ""It\'s hard in New York. Every game you could come in and throw four touchdowns and they\'re saying you\'re the greatest player and you\'re the MVP. The next week you can throw two interceptions and they\'re saying you\'re a bust and a big mistake. ""I think that he\'s handled that so well these four years. Each year he\'s made improvements. He\'s seen things he needs to work on and he\'s fixed them ... so he can rise to the occasion, he can win the big game. So, I think we\'ll just continue to see him grow and take more of that leadership role.""     Tommy@TommyG105Eli Manning giving his thoughts on Daniel Jones career in NY so far.#NYGiants #TommysTakes886 Jones was selected by the New York Giants during the 2019 NFL draft to be the direct successor to Manning. His career has been a bit of a roller coaster so far, but he enjoyed a breakout 2022 season. In his first postseason appearance, he helped the Giants defeat the Minnesota Vikings before being eliminated by the Philadelphia Eagles. His performances earned him a massive contract extension, making him the Giants\' franchise quarterback for the foreseeable future      If Daniel Jones can build off his success from last season, he can join Manning one day in the pantheon of Giants greats. Eli Manning\'s postseason success Eli Manning Eli Manning helped the New York Giants make it to the NFL playoffs six times. In four of those appearances, he failed to win a single game. His other two trips to the postseason solidified his legacy as a Giants legend and potentially a future member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.     In the playoffs following the 2007 and 2011 NFL seasons, Manning led the Giants to the Super Bowl trophy. He won four games in each of those two postseason runs, bringing his career playoff record to 8-4, despite being winless in four appearances.Both of his two rings came by defeating the New England Patriots, including ruining what would have been an undefeated season for Tom Brady.     ', ""What is Daniel Jones' contract with New York Giants?  New York Giants quarterback Daniel jones is playing his fourth season in the NFL. With a record of 9-6-1, Jones is having the first winning season of his career. Moreover, Jones has led his team to the NFL Playoffs for the first time in the last six years.  The Giants last made it to the playoffs in 2016, where they suffered a defeat in the Wild Card Round. They have played 98 seasons in the NFL, and have been in the playoffs 32 times.        In Week 17, the Giants defeated the Indianapolis Colts, 38-10, and clinched a spot in the playoffs as the No. 6 seed. In his last game, Jones threw for 177 yards and two touchdowns with a pass completion percentage of 79.17.              Daniel Jones is playing his last season with the Giants and will enter free agency after the 2022-23 season. In 2019, Daniel Jones agreed to a four-year, $25,664,056 deal with the New York Giants, which featured a $16,684,768 signing bonus, $25,664,056 in guaranteed money, and a $6,416,014 average yearly salary.     Jones made $965,000 in basic pay, $3,229,644 in roster bonuses, $8,365,836 in cap hits, and $8,180,836 in dead cap value in 2022. The New York Giants also declined a $22.3 million contract extension for the 2023 season in April 2022. However, the Giants have performed extremely well this season and Jones' post-season performances could help him extend his contract with the Giants.

"", 'NFL 2020: New York Jets stay winless after Sam Darnold\'s poor performance  Things just keep getting worse for the New York Jets.  The team at the bottom of everyone\'s NFL power ranking fell to 0-7 with Sunday\'s 18-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills. The Jets are the league\'s only winless team, and the two people taking the most heat for that are head coach Adam Gase and quarterback Sam Darnold.        The No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Darnold has not lived up to expectations by any measure. There are other young QBs who are surrounded by teams with talent deficiencies -- Joe Burrow (Bengals), Justin Herbert (Chargers) and Daniel Jones (Giants) come to mind -- but they\'re doing better individually than Darnold.           On Sunday, Darnold completed 12 of 23 passes for 120 yards, with no touchdowns and two interceptions. His Quarterback Rating was 17.6 (out of a possible 100) and his Passer Rating was 31.1 (out of a possible 158.3). Jerry went OFF.@Iam_jerryhughes | #BUFvsNYJ pic.twitter.com/kzD4QclwC1‚Äî Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) October 26, 2020     Gase did his part in post-game interviews to shield his quarterback from blame. The Jets\' offensive line was called out by Gase. ""It was collapsing quick on him,"" the coach was quoted by ESPN,"" noting that Darnold ""didn\'t have a lot of time to throw the ball."" Gase added, ""If you look at it statistically, we\'re not good anywhere statistically."" Can the Jets continue with Adam Gase and Sam Darnold? Some of the blame for that has to go to Gase. He\'s the one who played a big hand in the Jets getting rid of All-Pro running back Le\'Veon Bell a couple weeks ago. Bell was signed by the Jets last year and made the highest-paid running back in the NFL. But Gase reportedly never wanted Bell on the team and couldn\'t figure out how to best use the talented runner.     Any time, any place.@LeVeonBell is ready to ball. pic.twitter.com/w6MLLizWap‚Äî New York Jets (@nyjets) January 31, 2020 Gase came to New York with a reputation as a quarterback guru and offensive genius. But now in his second season with the team, the Jets have the NFL\'s worst offense and their franchise QB is failing. No one would be surprised if the Jets fire Gase at the end of this season. If they are bad enough to land the No. 1 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, no one would be surprised if they use that pick on another quarterback -- probably Clemson\'s Trevor Lawrence -- and put the Darnold era behind them.     Before that, these Jets just need to get a win (or two).This week doesn\'t look good for that, as they face the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs on the road.After that, however, the Jets have three straight winnable games against the New England Patriots, Los Angeles Chargers and Miami Dolphins.     ', ""What happened to Nick Gates? Giants C suffers gruesome injury  The New York Giants have one of the worst offensive lines in the league, and it seems that they're going to have even more problems in the coming weeks.  Nick Gates, an interior offensive lineman who's a rare bright spot on the inside, was carted off the field after suffering a gruesome leg injury during Thursday's contest against the Washington Football Team. The images are not beautiful:        Ted Buddy üèàüèà@TedBuddy8Nick Gates injury, looks like a broken leg, #NYGvsWAS9:50 PM ¬∑ Sep 16, 202132192           The Giants were already short on the offensive line for the contest, as they lost guard Shane Lemieux to an injury during last week's game against the Denver Broncos and he was out for today's game. Lemieux's injury resulted in major changes regarding the offensive line. Gates, who started at center in Week 1, then moved to the left guard spot; Billy Price, a former first-round pick for the Bengals who has underperformed so far in his career, was inserted into the starting lineup.     New York Giants v Washington Football Team Chemistry is a vital factor for any offensive line to protect its quarterback well, and to see two players changing their spots in a short week against a ferocious defensive line made this an incredibly difficult situation for the Giants. Gates' injury makes things even worse, especially considering how much Daniel Jones' performance drops when he's under pressure. Nick Gates career with the Giants The Giants tried a ton of things to fix their offensive line since Dave Gettleman was hired as general manager. Gates is a rare example of what panned out.     A undrafted pick out of Nebraska, he spent his first year developing while placed at the injured reserve. He started four games during the 2019 season, playing in all 16 because of his participation with the special teams, and got promoted to starting center in 2020 after Jon Halapio left the team. Jordan Raanan@JordanRaananSignificant change for Giants OL vs. Wash. Plan is for Billy Price to start at center, per sources. Nick Gates slides to LG. Price was acquired via trade just over 2 weeks ago. Gates has started 1 NFL game in NFL at guard. Barkley went for 112 + 2 TDs in that ‚Äò19 win over MIA.3:03 PM ¬∑ Sep 16, 20211760185 Gates has the versatility to play in all three positions in the interior of the offensive line. He's a solid pass protector who also shines at run blocking. His good performances may be underrated because of the Giants' awful remainder of the offensive line, but they know they have a solid option in Gates.He's going to be a free agent after the season following a two year, $6,8 million contract extension signed in 2020. The Giants have already confirmed he suffered a lower leg fracture and, as he'll need surgery, he's going to be out for the remainder of the 2021 season.     "", ""NFL Fantasy football waiver wire for Week 2: Why Giants WR Sterling Shepard is a must-have  Fantasy football waiver wires move quickly, especially to leagues that have 12 or more participants. Injuries occur, leaving starters replaced by backups that pull off stellar performances. Those standout players then become offensive or defensive favorites, leading to heavy points accrued.  Of late, Sterling Shepard of the New York Giants has emerged as a favorite for most fantasy football managers to add to their teams. Although the Giants rolled over on Sunday, Shepard still managed to put up some good points on the fantasy football spectrum.        Is Sterling Shepard a viable WR1 or WR2 option?           Sterling Shepard emerged as Daniel Jones' favorite target on Sunday. Shepard pulled in seven catches for 113 yards and a TD. Everyone expected Darius Slayton and the newly acquired Kenny Golladay to be the favorites, but they both accounted for only seven catches. Shepard totaled both of their catches combined. Shepard was also targeted nine times versus Slayton being targeted seven times in second place. With clearly more production, Jones might be throwing a lot more balls Shepard's way. Slayton only accounted for 65 yards, while Shepard doubled that production. The Giants travel to take on the Washington Football Team on Thursday night. The WFT doesn't have that great of a secondary pressure, so Jones will be airing it out once again. Field Yates@FieldYatesSterling Shepard has at least 5 targets in 26 of his past 27 games played. He has double digit fantasy points in 18 of those 27 games too. insider.espn.com/fantasy/footba‚Ä¶3:58 AM ¬∑ Sep 14, 202118517     Shepard is currently being targeted at least five times. He's also pulling in double-digit fantasy points in more than half of those games. If that stat line remains the same, Shepard could land himself a worthy fantasy flex role with some placing Shepard as far up as WR2. Shepard is currently sitting at #6 in total yardage amongst wide receivers, currently beating out names like Darren Waller, Chris Godwin and Cooper Kupp, to name a few.

This dart from Daniel Jones is yanked out of the sky by Shepard. He then side-stepped a would-be tackler to run in for the TD. Shepard has playmaking abilities that go beyond just being able to catch the ball. The quickness on his feet should amount to a lot more YAC.     Fantasy owners would be wise to immediately pick up Shepard, as he is currently owned in about 40% of leagues. That 60% availability should welcome many fantasy football owners to immediately pick him up if available. Week 3 the Giants will host the Atlanta Falcons. Neither the WFT nor the Falcons have secondaries that should scare any fantasy football owners from starting Shepard in a bigger role over the next two weeks. Also, in Week 4, the Giants travel to take on the New Orleans Saints. The Saints recently lost Marshon Lattimore to a finger injury, so their secondary should be soft enough to allow Shepard to garner points.The next few weeks are the biggest reason why Shepard should be picked up and placed on active rosters, and if he outperforms again, expect Shepard to move even quicker off the waiver wire.Also Check Out: Complete NFL Week 2 TV Schedule     "", ""Who do the Giants play next?

It's a season where a player needs to stand out to determine the trajectory of his career. Generally, teams exercise extreme caution when investing in players who have flattered to deceive by the third year.   With that in mind, here's a list of the top 10 NFL players tipped to have a breakout year in 2021.        #1 Daniel Jones, QB, New York Giants           The Giants quarterback often splits opinion in the league. Jones was picked early in the 2019 NFL Draft and, so far, hasn't shown much to justify the investment. This could change in 2021. Kenny Golladay, Kyle Rudolph and Kadarius Toney are just some of the important names that have made their way to the Big Apple to bolster the team's offense, and the likes of Nate Solder and Saquon Barkley coming back will further help the Giants. This is a defining year in Jones' career and, with a better group around him, he should elevate his production. #2 Quinnen Williams, DT, New York Jets Quinnen may have been underestimated by some NFL fans because of the Jets' poor play over the last two seasons, but his impact on the team's defense was quite something. He led New York with 7 sacks in 2020, twice as much as Tarell Basham, who is second-best in this area.     The arrivals of Carl Lawson and Sheldon Rankins, as well as the hiring of Robert Saleh as head coach and the move to the 4-3 defense, should help Williams reach his potential and become a star in 2021. If all goes to plan, he'll likely be one of the best defensive tackles in the NFL for years to come. #3 Marquise Brown, WR, Baltimore Ravens Brown is a player who raised expectations after a good rookie year but failed to live up to those expectations in 2020, in a Ravens offense that desperately needed better wide receivers. This situation could change in 2021, as the arrivals of Sammy Watkins and Rashod Bateman will take a lot of pressure off Brown. In addition, he'll be able to align more often in the slot, which is his specialty, and ultimately become the deep target Baltimore initially bet he would be. San Francisco 49ers v Los Angeles Rams     #4 Deebo Samuel, WR, San Francisco 49ers Samuel has already shown flashes of what he can do in the NFL in his first two years, and with his speed and agility, being on an offense coached by Kyle Shanahan helps him a lot. Unfortunately, injuries prevented him from breaking out in 2020, but if he stays healthy, he could become the 49ers' top receiver. Regardless of whether the quarterback is Jimmy Garoppolo or Trey Lance, Samuel will be an essential part of one of the most exciting offenses in the NFL. #5 Chase Winovich, Edge, New England Patriots Winovich logged 5.5 sacks in each of his first two NFL seasons with the Patriots. With the arrival of Matt Judon, who should demand more attention from defenses, Winovich will have better opportunities to improve his production in 2021. One of the best defenses in the NFL in 2019, the Patriots badly needed production from the pass rush last year. If Judon's arrival has the expected effect and Winovich increases his numbers, the team's front seven will be more than a touch stronger.     #6 Ed Oliver, DT, Buffalo Bills Oliver had a disappointing 2020 when he officially became a starter for the Bills. The return of Star Lotulelei and a reinforced defensive line should take some of the pressure off Oliver, who was a top 10 pick in the 2019 NFL Draft. Ed Oliver is a little different from the average defensive tackle. He's faster and more athletic in comparison to the others, but he's also a smaller presence. All things considered, though, this should be Ed Oliver's year.

In addition to his well-known defense against the run game, he displayed some interesting flashes as a pass rusher last year and is a strong candidate to break out in 2021. The Giants aren't a team with many quality pass rushers, so having an interior defensive lineman who can pressure the quarterback from the inside is vital. Considering what we've seen of Lawrence in the first two years in the NFL, he could very well be that player. #8 Jonah Williams, OT, Cincinnati Bengals Jonah Williams was unable to play in his rookie year. In his second NFL season, the pandemic prevented him from having a full offseason to train and get used to the NFL. The rest of the Bengals' offensive line was a tad below average, leaving Williams with work to do this year.     Now healthy and able to prepare for a full offseason, in addition to being more experienced, Williams is set to become a quality player in 2021 protecting Joe Burrow. If he fails to impress, though, his NFL future looks bleak. Detroit Lions v Minnesota Vikings  #9 Irv Smith, TE, Minnesota Vikings Smith had some solid performances in his first two NFL seasons in Minnesota and is expected to get even better in 2021 now that Kyle Rudolph is out of the picture. With Adam Thielen and Justin Jefferson on the team, Irv Smith won't be Kirk Cousins' first option, but the attention the WR duo demand could make things easier for the tight end. An interesting safety valve for the quarterback.

Carson Wentz's inconsistency, Sanders' problems with fumbles and numerous injuries on the offensive line prevented Sanders from having a stellar campaign.In 2021, the new coaching staff and the changes in the offense should be good for the running back, who'll likely be one of Jalen Hurts' most effective outlets.     "", ""NFL Preseason Week 3: Biggest winners and losers  To begin with, the biggest winners of this week of the preseason are NFL fans. With this week done with, the next time football is played it will count towards someone's Super Bowl run.   Before bidding au revoir to the preseason, here's a look back at the biggest winners and losers of the week.        Winners and losers from the NFL preseason finale            Winners Kenny Yeboah, WR, New York Jets Entering the weekend, few were familiar with Yeboah. Exiting the weekend, Yeboah is the man of the hour.  Late in the Jets' game against the Philadelphia Eagles, they needed a miracle to tie the game. Yeboah ended up being at the center of the comeback. He caught four passes for 100 yards and two touchdowns, including a buzzer-beater Hail Mary that tied the game.  In the final fifteen minutes, Yeboah solidified himself on a roster somewhere, even if it isn't with the New York Jets. Sam Darnold, QB, Carolina Panthers Sam Darnold is one of the least hyped quarterbacks in the NFL going into 2021. However, he took a step towards proving the world wrong over the weekend.  After a slow start, Darnold finished the day by completing 19 of 25 passes for 162 yards and two touchdowns. If Darnold can keep that going, the Panthers may hang around longer than many expect this year.     Sam Darnold to Jets fans after he drops 400 on them in Week 1. pic.twitter.com/ejOBuKZaKM‚Äî Cat Crave (@CatCraveBlog) August 23, 2021  Trevor Lawrence, QB, Jacksonville Jaguars While it is too early to call Lawrence a bust in the NFL, after last week's performance against the Saints, he needed to bounce back this week.  Lawrence stepped up to the plate and delivered a great performance, completing almost every pass and slicing through the defense en route to two touchdowns and no interceptions. Losers  Denver Broncos One week after naming Teddy Bridgewater the starter, Broncos fans were anxious to see how Bridgewater would respond in the next game. After starting one for five, Bridgewater didn't inspire much confidence. To make matters worse, the Broncos' first team found themselves down to the Rams' second team early in the game.     While the Broncos were able to bounce back with a touchdown on Bridgewater's final drive, the sight of losing to backups leaves plenty expecting a rough NFL season for Denver. Above all, the game was a dose of reality after beating down two other second-team squads in previous weeks and served as a potential preview of the grind to come. Los Angeles Rams v Denver Broncos  Daniel Jones, QB, New York Giants Heading into 2021, Daniel Jones has his NFL career in his hands. The Giants have recruited more weapons and Saquon Barkley is back. Jones is out of excuses. If the Giants don't make some noise this year, they will be looking for Jones' replacement in the NFL Draft this year.         Unfortunately for Jones, his performance in this week's game channeled the Jones of 2020. For everything he did right in completing 17 of 22 pass attempts, he undid everything with his redzone interception. Rolling to his right, Jones fired into a sea of Patriots and the result was a turnover. If Jones plays like this in 2021, this will be his last year as a starter. Panthers' kicking game While the Panthers were able to beat expectations at the quarterback position, their kicking game looks to be in trouble. Joey Slye missed his only field goal attempt and while Ryan Santoso made both of his, he nearly missed one of the field goals.     Carolina Panthers v Los Angeles Chargers Even if Sam Darnold can beat expectations and get the Panthers within a few points of winning, the Panthers' kickers could sink the ship, going by their showing in Week 3.JK DobbinsThis is why more NFL coaches are keeping their starters out of the NFL preseason. JK Dobbins, the expected starting running back for the Baltimore Ravens, is expected to miss the season due to an ACL tear while the Ravens are celebrating yet another perfect NFL preseason.

In a game against the Browns early in his career, the quarterback took a hit late that left him down on the turf.        However, he returned to the game to throw one more pass near the goalline to win the game. A video of the event can be viewed here.More recently, the quarterback ended his 2019 season early due to an injury to his back.

The Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 to win Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium.  Quarterback Matthew Stafford made the winning play, throwing a one-yard pass to receiver Cooper Kupp for the go-ahead touchdown with under 90 seconds left in the game. The Bengals had enough time to answer back, but an impressive defensive stop by three-time Defensive Player of the Year Aaron Donald sealed the win for the Rams.        Although Stafford had a great game, the MVP award went to Kupp, who made several important catches throughout the match, including the game-winning touchdown. Nonetheless, Miami Heat legend Dwyane Wade believes Stafford\'s performance was enough to get him into the NFL Hall of Fame.      ""Matthew Stafford just wrote his HOF speech with this win!

He also had two interceptions, a reflection of the team\'s inconsistent season.     Several NBA players have also reacted to the thrilling game, including the LA Lakers\' LeBron James and the Golden State Warriors\' Draymond Green. In the end, the Rams\' gamble to win a championship in the short term paid off.  Dwyane Wade is a lock to become first-ballot Hall of Famer Former Miami Heat player Dwyane Wade laughs with head coach Erik Spoelstra and host Jason Jackson Wade had an astounding basketball career and is on course to become a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee as soon as he\'s eligible. According to the rules, a player must be fully retired for at least four full seasons before being eligible for enshrinement.     With that in mind, Wade will make the NBA Hall of Fame in 2023. The 2003 NBA draft\'s fifth overall pick played 16 seasons and retired in 2019. Wade had a successful career, winning three NBA championships during his 15-year stint with the Heat. He was also awarded the 2006 NBA Finals MVP for his role in leading Miami to a comeback series win against the Dallas Mavericks after being down 0-2.

', ""Was Matthew Stafford‚Äôs Super Bowl win legit? Rams‚Äô stark downfall raises questions after fruitful season  Matthew Stafford will miss this week's game against the Kansas City Chiefs due to a neck injury, according to the Los Angeles Rams. It's a good thing because he hasn't helped his case when he's been on the field. This season, he has thrown 10 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. His quarterback rating is 87.4, which is a significant drop from his fortunes last season.  Last season, he had 41 touchdowns and 17 interceptions, and a quarterback rating of 102.9. He's on pace for his worst season since 2014. This has prompted speculation about whether his Super Bowl victory last year was a fluke. People naturally think that exceptional play by Cooper Kupp, brilliance from Odell Beckham Jr., and a defense anchored by Aaron Donald and Von Miller was the reason he lifted the Lombardi Trophy.        There is a grain of truth to that side of the story. Losing players with the capability of Von Miller and Odell Beckham Jr. will affect any team negatively. Cooper Kupp has maintained his standards this season, but he is also now out injured along with Matthew Stafford. So, there has been a combination of factors that have led to the Los Angeles Rams being historically bad. But does such a performance wipe away the legitimacy of Matthew Stafford's Super Bowl win?           Sportskeeda Pro Football@SKProFootballThe Rams championship hangover has reached historic levels...   (via @NFLonFOX)#NFL #RamsHouse #HereWeGo7     Matthew Stafford's Super Bowl win will always remain with him As always in football reporting, the pendulum seems to swing towards extremes and not moderation. When Matthew Stafford won the Super Bowl, there was an immediate clamor in some quarters to call him a surefire future Hall-of-Famer. Now that the Rams are losing, he has been branded a fraud in many quarters. The truth is, as always, somewhere in the middle. We have enumerated his stats in the past, but the one place where he has not dipped this season is his completion percentage. His completion percentage last season was 67.2 percent and this year it inches upwards to 68 percent. Extrapolated over a season, he is also expected to have lesser interceptions than last year. However, touchdown passes and yards have both decreased in the last year. This is a cause for concern because passing attempts per game and completions have not decreased significantly. This suggests that yards per play are decreasing.     So, if we just look at the offense, the problem isn't so much that Matthew Stafford isn't playing well as it is that receivers aren't getting open downfield as much as they did last year. As a result, the quarterback's output has decreased. In addition, he has been sacked 29 times in nine games this season, compared to 30 in all of last season. The offensive line is also not performing as well as it should.

', ""Teams with the worst records after Super Bowl-winning seasons: Rams on course on make dubious history  Winning the Super Bowl is the ultimate win for any team in the NFL and the Los Angeles Rams achieved that last season. They went all in and traded future draft capital to build a team capable of winning now. A lot of things fell their way as they lifted the Lombardi Trophy.  They traded Matthew Stafford from the Detroit Lions, who went on to have a career season. Cooper Kupp was the best receiver in the league by far and was also the Super Bowl MVP. Odell Beckham Jr. came from the Cleveland Browns and was indispensable in the playoffs. Andrew Whitworth was as good as ever in what turned out to be his final season.        On defense, they had Aaron Donald being the best he always is and his final sack brought home the ring. Von Miller brought all his nous into harassing opposing quarterbacks. Jalen Ramsey was elite as the defense played their role in winning the Super Bowl. They had in Sean McVay one of the most exciting coaches in the league.           However, if a lot of things went their way last season, this season everything seems to be falling apart. They have a 3-8 record and are marooned at the bottom of the NFC West. Matthew Stafford is out with a concussion and Cooper Kupp is injured as well. Odell Beckham Jr. and Von Miller have left and Aaron Donald is now out as well. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that the Rams might lose more games than they win in the upcoming six games. If they do, they could end up with the worst Super Bowl hangover of all time. To put this possibility into perspective, we evaluate how previous Super Bowl champions have fared.     Most Super Bowl champions made the playoffs the following season, with a select few repeating as champions. However, there were some who failed to make the playoffs and only six teams have ever finished below the 0.500 win percentage. We are ignoring the Super Bowl XVI Champions San Francisco 49ers because the following 1982 was shortened by a strike. The entire format was changed and whole conferences were considered instead of divisions. They ended up with a 3-6 record. Here is how the other teams have fared while following up a Lombardi Trophy parade with a losing record. Their win loss record from next season is given in brackets.        Where do the Rams fare among Super Bowl champions with losing records the following season? #1 - Green Bay Packers, Super Bowl II winners (6-7-1) The earliest record of a losing season in the Super Bowl era after winning the championship the previous season came from the Green Bay Packers. The Packers were the dominant team in the era of the first Super Bowls and won both the inaugural and the second edition of the championship game. However, at the third time of asking, they could not repeat their feat. They slumped to a 6-7-1 record at the end of the regular season. It is a 0.429 win percentage. The New York Jets would take their crown instead in a record upset by defeating the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. #2 - Oakland Raiders, Super Bowl XV winners (7-9)     The Oakland Raiders defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XV 27-10. Jim Plunkett threw for three touchdowns, including two in the first quarter. The Eagles could never come back from an early deficit. For his contributions, Plunkett was named the Super Bowl MVP. However, the following season, his output and the general play of the Raiders plummeted and they finished with a 7-9 record. This equates to a 0.438 win percentage. They finished bottom of the AFC West division. #3 - New York Giants, Super Bowl XXI winners (6-9) The New York Giants won Super Bowl XXI, defeating the Denver Broncos 39-20. Phil Simms was named the MVP for an explosive offensive performance. The Giants went into this game with a 14-2 record that made them the top seed in the matchup. But as good as they were this season, their record tanked the following season. They finished with a 6-9 record, with just 0.400 as their win percentage. Only 15 games were played this season due to a strike, but unlike the 1982 season that we have ignored, the format was not changed. At the time, it meant having the worst record for a Super Bowl champion the following season. They finished bottom of the NFC East just one season removed from winning it all.     #4 - Washington Redskins, Super Bowl XXII winners (7-9) Whatever bug had bitten the New York Giants the previous season infected the Washington Redskins as well after winning Super Bowl XXII. They blew the Denver Broncos out of the water 42-10 despite being the third seed that season, coming into the game with an 11-4 record. But if they got lucky the previous season, it all went haywire the next as they finished with a 7-9 losing record with a 0.438 win percentage. Washington did avoid the ignominy of finishing bottom of their division and finished third in the NFC East. #5 - Denver Broncos, Super Bowl XXXIII winners (6-10) The Denver Broncos had two phenomenal seasons in the final couple of years of John Elway's career. They won two back-to-back Super Bowls before Elway announced his retirement. He won the Super Bowl MVP award in this game as well. But it showed just how important he was when they came back the following season.     They had a total fall from grace after the previous two seasons when they finished with a 6-10 record. Their winning percentage of 0.375 is the lowest amongst Super Bowl winners till date. They finished bottom of the AFC West. #6 - Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Super Bowl XXXVII winners (7-9) The last team to finish with a losing record and miss the playoffs after winning the Super Bowl are the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They had won the 37th edition of the Super Bowl 48-21 defeating the Oakland Raiders. But they could not replicate their success the following season, finishing with just a 7-9 record and a 0.438 win percentage. Their only saving grace was that they did not finish bottom of the NFC South, finishing instead in third place. The Los Angeles Rams currently have a 3-8 record, which means a 0.273 win percentage. Extraplolated over a season, they would finish with a 5-12 record. If that is what indeed happens, they will have finished with the worst record for Super Bowl champions the following season.     Frank Fleming@NjTank99The Rams may set the record for the worst season following a Super Bowl championship Broncos went 6-10 post-Elway after winning 2 straightRams are currently 3-7 after losing to Saints672The Los Angeles Rams will have the worst win percentage as well as the most matches lost, surpassing the Denver Broncos. The Rams will also have the fewest wins in a season if it holds. For the Rams this season, they need to win not to get to the playoffs, but to avoid infamy.     ""]"
79,Brock Osweiler,"['5 NFL players who regretted leaving their team for money  The allure of NFL free agency can be mesmeric to players, especially after they‚Äôve put their years into an ailing franchise that drafted them.  Players look to move into free agency for a multitude of reasons: they want a change of scenery for their family, they want to reunite playing with an old collegiate teammate, or quite simply, they want the best chance to win a Super Bowl.        However, there is another reason why players are so eager to stay healthy in the final year of their contract‚Ä¶ money.           Leaving your team and becoming a free agent makes you a precious commodity, especially if it is a lean year in your particular position. A dearth of productive running backs will see a medium-to-good player in that role immediately become worth $10 million more than in a class with more options. This can tempt players to make money-based decisions, with some choosing to leave their team in favor of a big payday. Here are 5 NFL players who have regretted leaving for money #1 - Nate Solder Super Bowl LI - New England Patriots v Atlanta Falcons     Nate Solder was a star offensive lineman for the New England Patriots and was one of the rare first-round selections higher than No. 20 of the Bill Belichick era. There was little shock when Solder arrived, as he immediately started 13 of the Patriots‚Äô 16 games in his rookie season, allowing just three sacks and four quarterback pressures. Solder would continue to have this consistency throughout his career in New England, becoming one of the best linemen in the NFL, constantly giving Tom Brady valuable protection. Two Super Bowl championships came during his time in Foxboro. But in 2018, he elected to leave the franchise and explore free agency. He signed a four-year, $62 million deal with $35 million guaranteed with the New York Giants. Having chosen a path that saw him become the highest-paid offensive lineman in the NFL, Solder quickly realized that the Giants had a poor roster. He missed the playoffs for the first time in his career in his debut year in New York and was never quite the same player.     As a result of COVID-19, Solder opted out of the 2020 season before returning in 2021. After another challenging year for the Giants, his contract was automatically voided, putting him on the free-agent market again. #2 - Josh Norman Carolina Panthers v Washington Redskins Josh Norman in Carolina was a machine. He was one of the closest cornerbacks to Darrelle Revis we‚Äôve seen since Revis Island himself left receivers stranded every week. He was so dominant that teams simply refused to target his side of the field, hence why his interception numbers were so low. But teams could see just what an impact he made on Carolina‚Äôs defense.     After being drafted relatively late at 25 years old, Norman spent four years with the Panthers, where he was comfortable, even coming fourth in the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award for 2015. This made Norman a valuable commodity, and he looked to maximize his wealth on the open market, signing with the Washington Commanders for five years and $75 million. While he announced a media career with Fox would run in conjunction with his time in Washington, it was clear that Norman had made a poor choice. He was never the same dominant defensive player in the NFL, being benched several times for poor plays. NFL Memes@NFL_MemesDERRICK HENRY JUST THREW JOSH NORMAN OUT OF THE CLUB204283282     He was released after four years and then spent single seasons with the Buffalo Bills and the San Francisco 49ers, where his diminishing speed made him an attractive target for quarterbacks rather than a feared one. #3 - DeMarco Murray Washington Redskins v Dallas Cowboys The lifespan of a running back in the NFL can be short, given that it places huge physical demands on the legs and muscles of a player. DeMarco Murray, though, was a player who had earned every penny of what the Philadelphia Eagles were willing to pay him.     In four seasons with the Dallas Cowboys, Murray had emerged as one of the most dominant backs in the NFL. His final two seasons in Dallas saw him rush for 1,121 yards and an NFL-leading 1,845 yards, respectively. In 2014 he won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year award and carried the Cowboys back to relevance. Murray was a hero in Dallas, breaking Emmitt Smith‚Äôs single-season rushing record with the Cowboys, but he elected to leave to earn more money in Philadelphia. His career has never been the same, and it should serve as a cautionary tale to young running backs; they need to know the value of their body. Murray signed a $42 million deal with the Eagles but was there for only one season. He managed just 702 yards before being traded to the Tennessee Titans. A brief return to productivity occurred with a 2016 pro-bowl season where Murray rushed for 1,287 yards, but after a dismal second season in Nashville, he retired from the NFL.     It was a dramatic fall from grace when, in fact, he was probably closer to a Super Bowl in the comfort of his situation in Dallas. #4 - Le‚ÄôVeon Bell Buffalo Bills v New York Jets Le‚ÄôVeon Bell‚Äôs relationship with the Pittsburgh Steelers was troublesome for several years. Mike Tomlin did his best to manage the trifecta of Ben Roethlisberger, Bell, and Brown, but ultimately something had to give. Despite their difficulties in Pittsburgh, all three played their very best football together with the Steelers, so it‚Äôs a shame to see how things panned out.     Bell rushed for over 1,250 yards in three of his five active seasons with the Steelers. He was one of the best rushers in the NFL but elected to sit out the 2018 season after refusing to sign the franchise tag for a second successive season. After a year away from the NFL, Bell would eventually be released and given the freedom to sign an eye-watering $52.5 million contract with the New York Jets for four years. He lasted one full year in the Big Apple before being released two games into his second season. The motivation was gone, the spark was gone, and he was then unsuccessfully bounced between Kansas City, Baltimore, and Tampa Bay. He made his money, but he never recovered from a year out of the NFL, and he would have enjoyed so much more success in Pittsburgh. #5 - Brock Osweiler San Diego Chargers v Denver Broncos     There is no way to look at Brock Osweiler‚Äôs NFL career without feeling pain. After valiantly serving as backup to Peyton Manning in Denver, Osweiler inadvertently won a Super Bowl in such a role. However, his performances during Manning‚Äôs injury layoffs did enough to convince teams of his ability in a year where there wasn‚Äôt a great deal of quality available at quarterback. Osweiler refused to stay with the Broncos after his contract expired at the end of the 2015 season, instead electing to hit free agency and see what serious money he could make. The Houston Texans duly obliged, offering Osweiler a $72 million deal over four years, with a staggering $37 million guaranteed. Such a deal put pressure on Osweiler that his talent couldn‚Äôt shoulder. His only season in Houston ended with 2,957 passing yards and more interceptions than touchdowns. It was an unmitigated disaster, and while it perhaps highlighted the fact you can‚Äôt judge a quarterback by such a small sample size of NFL play, there is also a sense that Osweiler simply wasn‚Äôt that talented.     Adam Schefter@AdamSchefterStunner: Texans trade Brock Osweiler AND 2018 2nd-rd pick to CLEV for Browns to take Osweiler contract off Houston books, sources tell ESPN.940110132 The problem for the player himself, though, especially if he looks back in hindsight, is that had he been patient and stayed with the Broncos, Manning was about to retire. He knew the entire system and playbook in Denver and could have easily settled as a starter in a much better situation than what he found in Houston. Osweiler is a far richer man because of this move, but he perhaps missed out on a far better NFL career.

Who‚Äôs your pick?With the NFL rolling into its last month of the season, it‚Äôs about time to roll out our first NFL Power Rankings. With no truly elite teams rising above the others, there seem to be four teams with a legit shot at saying they should hoist the Lombardi Trophy, with five or six other teams nipping at their heels with the ability to make a legit run at the Super Bowl too. December will be about jockeying for playoff byes, figuring out the last playoff spots in the AFC and NFC, and watching to see if any team can create separation or show why they should be the favorite heading into the playoffs. Teams that were left on the outside looking in were the New York Jets, the surging Houston Texans, the Indianapolis Colts, Atlanta Falcons, and whatever team emerges from the abomination of the NFC East. Without further ado, let‚Äôs dive into the rankings.   #10 Green Bay Packers                  The Packers have hit a rough patch recently In at the 10 spot is the Green Bay Packers, a team that has hit a lull going 1-4 in their last five games, as their offense has regressed and the defense has not been able to pick up the tremendous slack brought about by the offense. As it currently stands, the Packers are not playing like a team that can seriously threaten for the Super Bowl, despite having the best quarterback alive when he‚Äôs rolling. This is an offense in disarray right now, one built on the talents of generational arm throwing to a receiver who can‚Äôt seem to create any separation from their defenders.     It doesn‚Äôt help that Aaron Rodgers has not been as accurate as he was in years past, therefore not being able to make up for his subpar receiver. The defense has finally started to turn a corner, displaying some very good performances holding three straight opponents under 20 points. If they can keep up this run going, which is not a given, it should buy time for the offense and Rodgers to start playing better come playoff time. The road to get on track starts Thursday night in Detroit, as they look to avenge a loss against the surging Lions. A loss here and true panic may start to set in the CheeseHead Nation.  #9 Minnesota Vikings The Vikings     The Packers‚Äô NFC North brethren roll in next, as the Minnesota Vikings have been coming into their own in head coach Mike Zimmer‚Äôs second season with the team. They have been riding a very old school approach, ride the workhorse in Adrian Peterson, letting their quarterback make some plays but never really be able to put the team in a bad situation and have an improving defense slowly constrict the other team‚Äôs offense as the game goes along Adrian Peterson is back to his normal dominant self, and as it stands now, he is the only non quarterback offensive player who can drag his team into the playoffs. The Vikings aren‚Äôt as Peterson-dependent as three years ago when they rode a 2,000-yard season from the back to the playoffs, as Teddy Bridgewater is capable of making some plays. Alex Smith and the defense led by defensive tackle Linval Joseph and linebacker Anthony Barr is playing better and better as the season progresses. The next five weeks will show us if the Vikings are real or just a psuedo-playoff team that rode a hot streak into playoff position. First up, home against Seattle on Sunday.     #8 Pittsburgh Steelers The Steelers‚Äô awesome twosome The Pittsburgh Steelers are fully entrenched as an offensive-led team, with two of the top five players at their position in quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and wide receiver Antonio Brown. Week in and week out, the Steelers ride or die with the performance of these two and more often than not, they have delivered for their team. However, as seen in last weeks loss against the Seattle Seahawks, the defense is sometimes incapable of cashing in on the exploits of their two stars on offense. They have been plauged by missed tackles and general lack of playmakers who can rise above and come up with a momentum-turning play that allows their offense to capitalize.     As the Steelers roll into December, they are going to have to rely on their two stars and the surprising D‚ÄôAngelo Williams, who has stepped in admirably for the injured Le‚ÄôVeon Bell and allowed the Steelers to continue rolling running the football. The Steelers roll into the last month of the season with three straight games against current playoff team, before closing up what should be a few easier games against the lesser lights of the AFC North. If the Steelers defense can perk up and play a little more opportunistically, they have a chance to really make some noise in the playoffs. #7 Kansas City Chiefs The Kansas City Chiefs     The surging Kansas City Chiefs have looked like one of the best team in football over the last five weeks, riding a five-game win streak with four double-digit wins. They are playing boa constrictor defense while riding an interception-less streak by quarterback Alex Smith who is also supplying them with some shocking throws that travel over 15 yards. Between Justin Houston, Derrick Johnson, Dontari Poe, and Eric Berry, the Chiefs have a defense that can carry them into the playoffs and all the way to the Super Bowl, provided everything breaks right for the offense. If they continue this trend of playing fabulously balanced, great defense, this team is going to be scary come playoff time. Offensively, the Chiefs need to need to find a running game that has somewhat died since Jamaal Charles got injured because Alex Smith needs a running game to truly thrive and open up his play action passing game.     What has helped Smith so much this year is the play of receiver Jeremy Maclin and tight end Travis Kelce, giving the notoriously risk-averse Smith a pair of targets capable of taking Smith‚Äôs highly accurate throws and turning them into big plays. The Chiefs have a very soft schedule to close the year, meaning they should close with four or five wins and the top AFC wild card team. #6 Seattle Seahawks Russell Wilson is the Seahawks‚Äô trump card The two-time defending NFC Champs are lurking, playing somewhat erratically this season, but with a big win against the Steelers last week to stay above .500, they are sitting as the second wild card team in the NFC, just looking for a shot to defend their crown.     The defense is down this year from its three-year run of utter domination, but they are still a top 10 outfit with loads of playmakers among each tier who can win a playoff game themselves. Offensively, they seem to have found a running back in Thomas Rawls, who is more than capable of taking over for the injured Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson has that special ability to catch fire and rip the heart out of the opponent. With Jimmy Graham now out for the season with a torn patella, the onus will be on Wilson even more to carry a game that features an offensive line that looks like it forgets to block sometimes and a receiving core that is steady, but not above average. If the Seahawks want to get to their third Super Bowl in three years, they will have to ride a defense that needs to batten down the hatches and come close to the heights they were previously at. They don‚Äôt have a daunting schedule, and if everything breaks right, they could set up a winner take all for the NFC West title in week 17.     #5 Denver Broncos Will Manning or Osweiler start for the Broncos? After a comeback win against the previously undefeated New England Patriots last Sunday night, there is a murmur that Brock Osweiler should remain the starter even when Peyton Manning comes back from injury. You won‚Äôt get any complaint from me, as Peyton has just not been good this year and if you bring a guy back who has played that bad, I‚Äôm not sure you can expect to win when the weather starts to get colder. Osweiler, while he has not been spectacular by any means, has been able to move the offense more effectively, and, even more importantly, hold onto the football.     The shakiness at the quarterback position is somewhat muted because the Broncos have one of, if not the top defense, in the league. They have the best pair of cornerbacks in Chris Harris Jr. and Aqib Talib, and one of the best linebackers in Von Miller. If they can get DeMarcus Ware back and playing close to his early season level, this is another defense that has the ability to lead their team to the big game. They have a tough back-to-back stretch coming up on the road at Pittsburg followed by a Monday night home game against the Bengals, which will no doubt be the determining games for one of the two AFC byes. Win one and it better be vs the Bengals, win both and they should have a week off in January. #4 Cincinnati Bengals The Bengals are looking for the first playoff bye of the Marvin Lewis era     After a tough two-game stretch in mid-November, the Bengals are looking to close the season strong and secure their first playoff bye of the Marvin Lewis era. This is one of the most well-rounded teams in the league. The Bengals boast an offense that has weapons oozing from every position, offensive line included, and a defense that sits squarely in the top 10, sporting one of the top players in the league in defensive tackle Geno Atkins. For a team at the Bengals‚Äô stage however, the regular season is a mere formality because all anyone cares about is if this regular season success will finally transfer into playoff victories. The Bengals still have games left vs the aforementioned Steelers and Broncos, games they have to win so they can enjoy an extra week of preparation and rest in January. The Bengals‚Äô remaining three games are against some of the weaker teams in the league (Ravens, Browns, 49ers), but they must take care of these games handily to keep instilling confidence in their fan base and the rest of the league‚Äôs fans. Andy Dalton and how he handles a pass rush will be the ultimate deciding factor in how far the Bengals go this year.      #3 Carolina Panthers The Panthers, though undefeated, have faced easy opponents Blasphemy! I don‚Äôt have the only undefeated team in the league as number one in my rankings! As I look at it right now, you can put the last three teams in any order and you wouldn‚Äôt be wrong. Remember when I said that there hasn‚Äôt been a team or two which has separated itself from the field, well this manifests it right here. The Panthers have played one of the easiest schedules in the league, doing their cross-divisional matchups with the AFC South and the NFC East, the two worst divisions in football.     Now you can never take away a team‚Äôs undefeated record, but you must be able to look at it critically and see that all records are not created equal. The Panthers have been slowly dominating more and more games, through great play, both running and passing, by Cam Newtown, a dominating run game that can puncture a defense in multiple ways, and a defense that features some of the top players in the league. Cornerback Josh Morgan is the best cover man in the league, linebackers Luke Kuechley and Thomas Davis form the best 1-2 punch since Patrick Willis and Novarro Bowman, and the defensive line is deep, big, and athletic. This is a monster that seems to be building steam as the season goes on, and if they can manage to win out, very possible, they would undoubtedly go into the playoffs as the number one favorite to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl.     #2 New England Patriots The New England Patriots The Patriots aren‚Äôt dropping so much for their loss, a tough one, in bad weather, against a top five team, as much as all the injuries that the Patriots have faced in the last month or so leaves us wondering what they are going to look like if and when they get to full strength. If they get everyone back and rolling at 100%, they are, in my eyes, the best team in the league with the best coach, but getting everyone back healthy and rolling at the start of the playoffs is no easy task. All this is possible because Rob Gronkowski was able to escape a scary hit last week with nothing more than a bone bruise, because with no Gronk, there is no chance for Super Bowl.     The Patriots are still in the driver‚Äôs seat for the number one seed in the AFC, but they do have two tough games coming up, first on the road in two weeks against a Houston Texans defense that is playing awesome right now, and then, two weeks later on the road vs the New York Jets. Get past these two and they should be good to go heading into week 17 to rest their key guys vs the Miami Dolphins and absorb a loss. But they must find a way to move the football and stop the run through this run, as they watch top players seemingly drop off every week. #1 Arizona Cardinals The Cardinals have a tough-yet-achievable chance at being the number one team entering the Super Bowl     My top team is the Arizona Cardinals, an outfit that has a treasure chest of playmakers on offense and defense. They have an MVP candidate at quarterback, Carson Palmer, and a defensive player of the year candidate in defensive back Tyrann Mathieu, and those are just two of the studs they trot out every game. Patrick Peterson is playing like a top cornerback after being diagnosed with diabetes in the offseason, which allowed him to get his weight under control. The wide receivers led by the ageless Larry Fitzgerald are enjoying life in head coach Bruce Arian‚Äôs high-flying offense, and the rest of the defense has fast, smart players that execute the Cardinals aggressive game plan perfectly. The Cardinals have a very tough end of the year, taking on a St. Louis Rams team on the road this week that always give them trouble, followed by home matchups with fellow top 10 teams, Minnesota Vikings, Green Bay Packers, and Seattle Seahawks. If the Cardinals want to prove my number one ranking and head into the playoffs with a bye, the number one seed is going to be tough to get, they are going to have to knock off the Vikings and most likely go 3-1 in their other four games. Do this, and they will stay neck-and-neck with the Panthers as the top contender for the NFC‚Äôs spot in the Super Bowl.

It is a notoriously difficult place to fill at the best of times, but it is especially difficult when someone is trying to replace an all-time great like Peyton Manning.  We take a look at every starter who has played for the Denver Broncos in that position since Peyton Manning's retirement. As this has been such an unstable position for the franchise after Peyton Manning, in most seasons, they have had multiple starters in the given position. So, for the purposes of clarity, only those who started most games are listed at the top and others who played in those seasons are mentioned separately.                       Denver Broncos quarterbacks since Peyton Manning retired 2016 and 2017 - Trevor Siemian Right after Peyton Manning retired, Brock Osweiler, who had started some of the games the previous year with Peyton Manning in their Super Bowl-winning season, left for the Houston Texans to become their starter. That opened up the field for third-choice Trevor Siemian to compete with rookie Paxton Lynch and veteran Mark Sanchez, and Siemian eventually became the starter.     James Palmer@JamesPalmerTVTrevor Siemian is the only QB with a winning record for the #Broncos since Peyton Manning retired entering the 2016 seasonTrevor Siemian (13-11), Case Keenum (6-10), Paxton Lynch (1-3), Joe Flacco (0-4) and Brock Osweiler (0-4)35588 In 2016, he played 14 of 16 games for the Denver Broncos (the last two weeks were quarterbacked by Paxton Lynch) and established himself as the first choice. Even though the Broncos missed the playoffs, he finished with a passer rating of 84.6 that was higher than Peyton Manning and Brock Osweiler from the previous season. Over the last six weeks of his season from Weeks 8 to 14, he averaged more than 300 yards, behind only Tom Brady and Kirk Cousins. He was named a Pro Bowl alternate but did not accept the invitation due to the shoulder surgery he went ahead with after Week 14.        In 2017, now firmly established as a starter but under new coach Vance Joseph, he began the season strongly, and the high point was a game against the Dallas Cowboys where he threw four touchdowns. In Week 6, he suffered a shoulder injury. Then, over the next few weeks, his production declined. He was benched in favor of the returning Brock Osweiler in Week 9, who was himself then relieved by Paxton Lynch in Week 12. After Lynch was injured in that game, Siemian got another chance to lead the Broncos. But another shoulder injury in Week 15 spelled the end of his career with the Broncos as Brock Osweiler relieved him in that game and started in Week 16.     2018 - Case Keenum After the upheaval of the previous season, when the Broncos had three quarterbacks trading places, head coach Vance Joseph chose to reunite with former Houston Texans quarterback Case Keenum, who they traded from the Minnesota Vikings. They stuck with him throughout the season and he started all 16 games as the Broncos went 6-10.    He threw for 3,890 yards with a 62.3 completion rate. He had 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, with a 81.2 passer rating. He was traded to the Washington Redskins for a seventh-round pick in 2019.     2019 - Joe Flacco In 2019, the Denver Broncos decided to go with Joe Flacco, who had won one Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens. There were eerie parallels with Peyton Manning as they plumped for a veteran quarterback and former Super Bowl MVP. He was named the starter and had the job until he faced a neck injury in Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts. In those eight games that he started, he had 1,822 passing yards, six touchdowns, five interceptions, and an 85.1 passer rating. He was subsequently released by the Broncos and went on to sign with the New York Jets, where he still is currently.        After Joe Flacco was injured, he was replaced by Brandon Allen for three games before Drew Lock stepped in for the final five games of the season. The rookie quarterback finished with 1,020 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions in those five games and equalled John Elway's franchise record for most wins by a rookie in Broncos history. His four wins came in just five games compared to the 10 taken by Elway.

In Week 2, he injured his shoulder and would not return until Week 6. During that period, Jeff Driskel and Brett Rypien started one game each. In Week 12, due to a COVID outbreak among the quarterback corps, running back Phillip Lindsay started under center.     Lock's performances in his second season were not up to standard. Case in point, he had 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. This was the joint highest in the league , tied with Carson Wentz, despite Lock only playing 13 matches. His 57.3 completion rate was the lowest among all quarterbacks with, at least, 150 passing attempts that season.    2021 - Teddy Bridgewater In 2021, Teddy Bridgewater, the 2015 Pro Bowler, joined the team from the Carolina Panthers. He beat out Drew Lock to become the starter, though Lock started three games in each of which Bridgewater was out injured. In the 13 games that he started, he threw for 3,052 yards, 18 touchdowns, and seven interceptions for a passer rating of 94.9 with a 66.9 completion percentage. At the end of the season, he was traded to the Miami Dolphins as the Denver Broncos acquired Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks.     2022 - Russell Wilson   Russell Wilson joined from the Seattle Seahawks. In a deal that sent Drew Lock to Seattle, along with other players and draft picks, the future hall-of-famer joined the Denver Broncos for a five-year, $245 million deal. The Broncos will hope to replicate the success they had with Peyton Manning when they last had a future hall-of-famer as their quarterback.     ""]"
80,Nick Foles,"['‚ÄúIt sucks‚Äù- Tom Brady once got candid about devastating Super Bowl LII loss to Eagles despite historic performance  Tom Brady once opened up about his true feelings when he lost Super Bowl LII as a New England Patriots quarterback against the Philadelphia Eagles.  TB12 led the New England Patriots nine times to the Super Bowl, and he won six of them. He could have won seven Super Bowl titles when he was with the Pats; however, he failed to do so.        Super Bowl LII took place in February 2018 between the Patriots and the Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Even though Brady had a remarkable game, throwing for 505 yards and three touchdowns, his efforts were not enough to secure a victory for the Patriots.           In the second half, Tom Brady and his team faced a 10-point deficit. However, Brady led a comeback effort by throwing touchdown passes to Rob Gronkowski and Chris Hogan. The first touchdown pass helped narrow the gap, while the second one gave the Patriots a 33-32 lead with 9:22 remaining in the game. Despite Brady‚Äôs efforts to lead the Patriots to a victory, Nick Foles and the Eagles responded with a touchdown drive of their own. With the game on the line, Brady had the opportunity to engineer another iconic Super Bowl-winning drive. However, the Eagles‚Äô defense had other plans. Brandon Graham‚Äôs strip-sack of Brady halted New England‚Äôs comeback attempt.     ""They\'re all pretty disappointing,"" Brady said, per Edward Lewis of NFL.com. ""I mean, losing sucks. But you show up and you try to win and sometimes you lose and that\'s the way it goes. ... It obviously‚Äîyup, it sucks."" The strip-sack forced the turnover and gave possession back to Philadelphia. The Patriots‚Äô last chance to score ended with a failed Hail Mary attempt in their final position, sealing the Eagles‚Äô victory. Tom Brady\'s last Super Bowl loss came against the Eagles Super Bowl LII - Philadelphia Eagles v New England Patriots     The 15-time Pro Bowler retired from the NFL in February 2023, after his 2022 season went lukewarm. He played with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2020 to 2022 and won his last Super Bowl ring with them. But his last Super Bowl loss came against Nick Foles and the Eagles. Many argue that Tom Brady\'s performance against Philadelphia was the best of his entire career, although it brought no success. His ability to rally his team and make crucial plays was instrumental in putting the Patriots in a position to potentially win the game.Although Tom Brady\'s comeback bid fell short, his legacy as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history remained intact. The game showcased the competitiveness and drama that often defines Super Bowl matchups.     ', ""Nick Foles net worth: How much is former Eagles QB worth in 2023?  Over his 11 seasons in the NFL, Nick Foles has experienced many highs and lows of being an elite-level quarterback. From winning a Super Bowl in his second stint with the Eagles to sustaining a litany of injuries, his career has seen various milestones and heartbreaks.  As of this writing, Foles has earned $86 million solely from football. His last contract was in 2022, when he joined the Indianapolis Colts for $6.2 million, with $4 million guaranteed. He was waived on May 5.        The most lucrative contract Foles has ever had was for four years and $88 million with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He signed the deal in 2019, fresh off his second straight year bringing the Eagles to at least the Divisional Round in relief of Carson Wentz.           However, he suffered a shoulder injury right in Week 1, and ultimately started (and played) only three more games. Including the season opener, he lost all his starts and was eventually benched for then-rookie Gardner Minshew. He was then traded to the Chicago Bears, who released him after 2021. Besides his earnings on the field, Foles also has had endorsements with athletic apparel brands Under Armour and Lululemon (specifically its men's line) and coffee and food maker Bulletproof 360. Unfortunately, no specific figures have been released about his off-field earnings. Foles has spoken about not earning as much off the field as he does on it. Speaking to Men's Journal, he explained why he had been declining endorsement deals throughout his career:     For my own sanity, I try to say no to things, especially when it comes to corporate endorsements. If you‚Äôre an NFL player, companies will throw money at you to put your name on stuff, and it can get crazy. He also emphasized his need to stay true to his morals, which meant not selling out: My wife and I have been blessed, and giving is a big part of what we do. I don‚Äôt want to act fake to rep a product I don‚Äôt believe in. Being genuine is more important to me than trying to cash in on every opportunity.  Why have the Indianapolis Colts released Nick Foles? Anthony Richardson is the focal point of a massive rebuild in Indianapolis, making Nick Foles expendable     Foles' release from the Colts was something to be expected, as he played poorly in the two games he started, both towards the end of the season. He did not throw a single touchdown, instead getting intercepted four times, as well as giving up four sacks for a loss of 48 yards. Another reason for Foles' departure is the Colts' desire to rebuild around fourth overall pick Anthony Richardson. Fans have mockingly claimed that Richardson's minicamp performance impressed the front office enough to make Foles expendable, but an offensive core of Richardson, running back Jonathan Taylor, and wide receivers Michael Pittman Jr. and Josh Downs may return the Colts to the playoffs.     "", 'WATCH: Wild Nick Foles question at Jason and Travis Kelce\'s Beer Bowl  Jason and Travis Kelce\'s podcast ""New Heights"" has become wildly popular. NFL fans tune in each week to hear the NFL brothers take on all topics, not just football-related ones.  This summer, they have continued with their podcast throughout the offseason and hosted their first-ever ""New Heights Beer Bowl"". The videos from the event were posted on several platforms, including the official social media pages. And, to say that it was a wild event, may just be an understatement.        Contestants were seen chugging beers, playing the iconic party game Flip Cup, and talking to the Kelce brothers. Some of the responses they received from the participants were interesting.               One female contestant actually got wildly inappropriate with her answer when asked why she likes quarterback Nick Foles. In the snippet below, she said that she was a fan of his body. Later, recognizing the awkwardness of that answer, she asked if that was appropriate to say or not.      The entire ""Beer Bowl"" video can be found on The New Heights official YouTube page. And, while it may not be suited for younger audiences, it will definitely provide quite a few laughs. And, with the success of this year\'s ""Beer Bowl"" there\'s likely to be another next summer. What was the best advice Travis Kelce received before his SNL debut? Travis Kelce hosted the iconic ""Saturday Night Live"" earlier this year. It was the first time in three years that an NFL player hosted the show, the last being defensive end J.J. Watt, who did so in 2020.     The Chiefs tight end mentioned that everyone was giving him words of encouragement. It was one piece of advice that truly helped him prepare for the ""Saturday Night Live"" hosting role. CNN@CNN\'SNL\': Travis Kelce talks Super Bowl victory25230 Travis Kelce said it was Peyton Manning, who also previously hosted the show, who gave him key advice. ‚ÄúPeyton Manning gave me one word of advice going into it which was which was the best advice that I could get and he said, \'Do just go all in. Just be open minded. Just go all in beyond time.""Peyton Manning encouraged the Kansas City Chiefs tight end to go \'all in\' and just be open to whatever the role was. Adding that no matter the type of scene that the production crew planned, being open is the key to giving the best performance.     ', 'How did Nick Foles get his NSFW nickname? Here‚Äôs how Colts QB got unusual moniker in locker room  Nick Foles will be remembered by Philadelphia Eagles fans for the ""Philly Special"" in Super Bowl 52 but other fans know him for his nickname. While with the Eagles, Foles got the nickname Big D**k Nick (BDN) from then-teammate and linebacker Conor Barwin.  Barwin did a Reddit AMA in 2014 where he answered questions from fans. The linebacker was able to choose which questions to answer and somehow the size of the players ""weiners"" were asked.        This was the question asked in that AMA:              Here is the response in the thread answered by Barwin:        What adds to the legend of the nickname is that interaction is a question that was answered on the official Eagles Reddit account. It gave off the impression as though the team was making that statement. Along with Barwin\'s assertion, Deadspin also added in a 2018 blog post that Foles had the BDN nickname while at the University of Arizona. Deadspin said the Indianapolis Colts quarterback also picked up the nickname ""Footlong Foles"" while at Arizona. Yet, it\'s difficult to know how genuine these claims are. In 2019, the news publication, The Philly Voice, reached out to Barwin to see if he wanted to say anything more about the 2014 comment. Barwin said: ""I think I\'ll just leave it there. Happy as hell for him!"" Former Eagles teammates also joined in on the joke about Foles, possibly confirming the size. Offensive center Lane Johnson joked about the former Eagles quarterback leaving behind a certain protective product:     Lane Johnson@LaneJohnson65I think u left this bud @NickFoles #BDN416398323 While Foles\' ""private parts"" were deemed large, so was his play in Super Bowl 52 versus the New England Patriots.  Big D**k Nick Foles\' performance in Super Bowl 52 Nick Foles played really big on the biggest stage for the Eagles in Super Bowl 52. He went 28 of 43 passing for 373 yards, three touchdowns and an interception. In the second quarter, he caught a touchdown from tight end Trey Burton, aka the ""Philly Special"". He added even more to the legacy with the Eagles by winning the Super Bowl MVP award.       Currently in his 11th season in the NFL, his time with the Philadelphia Eagles will not soon be forgotten. Some fans and former Eagles teammates will always see Nick Foles from a bigger perspective.If you use any of the above quotes, please credit Philly Voice and H/T Sportskeeda.     ', ""How many times have the Eagles been to the Super Bowl?  Despite being among the NFL's most dominant teams over the last 30 years, the Philadelphia Eagles do not really have enough trophies to show for their dominance. The Eagles have only made it to the Super Bowl a handful of times since the inaugural Super Bowl was contested in 1967, despite having more than 20 campaigns with double-digit wins.  A golden chance to capture their fifth title but just their second Super Bowl awaits the Eagles as they prepare for their matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs at Super Bowl LVII. Before the Super Bowl, the Eagles were NFL winners in 1948, 1949, and 1960. Three of those championships were won before the introduction of the Super Bowl in 1966, though.        Paul C@HurtsyIvaniaName the 7 active players on Eagles Roster now that played in 2017 Superbowl on Eagles?No cheating332           The Philadelphia Eagles have only ever captured the Super Bowl once. In 2018, they won Super Bowl LII, beating the New England Patriots 41‚Äì33. Philadelphia was anchored by second-string quarterback Nick Foles, who took over for starting QB Carson Wentz when he tore his ACL during the regular season, ending his season.

For Philadelphia fans, the later part of the campaign felt like another disaster waiting to happen. Carson Wentz was the leading MVP contender when he tore his ACL late in the regular season. In their remaining three regular-season games under Foles, the Eagles went 2-1. Foles then excelled in a dramatic Super Bowl. The combined 1,151 yards between the New England Patriots and Eagles was the most in an NFL game in history. Foles passed for 373 yards and three scores and received MVP honors for the Super Bowl.  Who did the Eagles face in previous Super Bowls? The Philadelphia Eagles' first two Super Bowl outings didn't have the same successful outcome as their most recent one.

Abraham started by questioning the quarterback about inaccurate passes.           ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been kind of a narrative out here in training camp that you‚Äôve been a little inaccurate on your throws. ‚ÄòConsistently inconsistent‚Äô has been kind of the terminology. How would you access your performance in training camp?‚Äù The terminology Abraham referred to was clearly news to the quarterback, who defended himself by saying training camp was too early to make assessments like that. The reporter also asked if this was his last chance in the NFL as a starter after Philly and Indianapolis didn‚Äôt want him. The line of questioning drew the ire of team president Jason Wright, who took to Twitter to defend his quarterback and condemn the disrespectful tone of the local reporter.

Blessed to be here43730 Although Wentz handled the interview well, his play on the field will ultimately be the only way he can quiet his critics. If his past few seasons have been any indication, he is the type to let all the talk get to him. Many believe that his struggles are mental, especially after Nick Foles stepped in and led the Eagles to a Super Bowl win. That was the same year that Wentz saw his MVP chances dashed by injury.     "", ""Should the Indianapolis Colts sign Gardner Minshew?\xa0  Gardner Minshew is set to become a free agent this offseason. Would signing him be a good move for the quarterback-needy Indianapolis Colts?  Yes, signing Minshew would be a solid move for the Colts.        The Colts were one of the NFL's worst teams this past season, finishing with a 4-12-1 record. When you lack a franchise quarterback, it's extremely difficult to win in today's NFL. Take a look around the league. The top teams possess a superstar signal-caller like Patrick Mahomes, Jalen Hurts or Joe Burrow.           The Fantasy Source üç•@FantasySource_REPORT: @Colts to make a QB change for Week 8. Sam Ehlinger will replace veteran Matt Ryan as the starter. Nick Foles will remain the backup1129 Indianapolis started three quarterbacks during the 2022-23 campaign: Matt Ryan, Sam Ehlinger and Nick Foles. Sorry, but you can't call any of those guys elite. Ryan was benched twice, and the backup duo of Ehlinger and Foles didn't impress much either.     Who is Gardner Minshew? Gardner Minshew began his career with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019. Minshew was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the sixth round (178th overall pick) of the 2019 NFL Draft. He ended up starting 12 games as a rookie, throwing for 3,271 yards, 21 touchdowns and six interceptions. After starting eight games for the Jaguars the following season, Minshew was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in August 2021 as he became a backup. Josh Tolentino@JCTSportsGardner Minshew was the only quarterback made available to reporters today. He didn‚Äôt want to dive into hypotheticals on whether or not he‚Äôs starting vs. Saints on Sunday.Minshew said there‚Äôs a lot to improve on from his performance against the Cowboys: 355 yards, 2 TD, 2 INT13910     Minshew had an outstanding performance against the Dallas Cowboys this past Christmas Eve, replacing injured starter Jalen Hurts. He threw for 355 yards and two touchdowns although the Eagles lost 40-34. In his career thus far, Minshew has started 24 of 32 games, producing 6,632 passing yards, 44 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.  Gardner Minshew knows Shane Steichen's offense. Ever since Andrew Luck retired in 2019, the Colts have gone the veteran quarterback route, acquiring players like Philip Rivers, Carson Wentz and Matt Ryan. This year should be different, though, as the Colts are expected to draft a quarterback. The team owns the fourth overall pick in the draft and will likely select Alabama's Bryce Young, Ohio State's C.J. Stroud or Kentucky's Will Levis.If that happens, a bridge quarterback could be acquired to fill in until the youngster is ready to start. Minshew would be perfect for that role. He played for new Colts head coach Shane Steichen, who served as the Eagles' offensive coordinator. Plus, if the rookie quarterback struggles mightily, Minshew could take over as the starter.     "", 'Are Philadelphia Eagles still unsure about QB Jalen Hurts? Philadelphia trades for Jacksonville QB Gardner Minshew  The Philadelphia Eagles may have made a very underrated roster move by acquiring QB Garnder Minshew from the Jacksonville Jaguars, adding to a roster with Jalen Hurts and Joe Flacco already in place. Gardner Minshew lost a QB ""battle"" that he was never seriously going to win against the number one overall pick Trevor Lawrence. Minshew was a breakout star in 2019 when he took over for Nick Foles. In 2020, he struggled on the field with a lingering hand injury that impacted his performance. The Jaguars drafted Lawrence, a generational talent, and it was just a matter of time before they traded Gardner Minshew as he wasn\'t going to unseat Trevor Lawrence any time soon.

The team also released QB Nick Mullens. pic.twitter.com/MLYrJfymxE‚Äî Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) August 28, 2021        Gardner Minshew trade shows uncertainty with Jalen Hurts...and Jacksonville Jaguars head coach?           Enter the Philadelphia Eagles, who have been in deep thought on what Jalen Hurts\' future holds with the team. Through three NFL preseason games, Jalen Hurts saw action only in Week 1 as the starter (3/7 for 54 yards). QB Joe Flacco played most of the preseason and played well, too. Philadelphia seems to be hinting to Jalen Hurts that his time as a starter could be in jeopardy by offering a sixth-round pick for Gardner Minshew. So yes, the Philadelphia Eagles are still not sold on Jalen Hurts being the face of their franchise. That doesn\'t mean he\'ll be benched immediately for Flacco or Minshew, who is #3 on the depth chart. The team does have options at QB now though, if injury, COVID-19, or regression strikes Jalen Hurts. Flacco had a great preseason and showed he can still perform with success in the NFL, but he\'s not suited to lead Nick Sirianni\'s offense. It requires a smaller, more mobile and athletic player and that has never been Joe Flacco. Gardner Minshew, on the other hand, looks like a prime candidate for such a system. The Eagles do not know if he\'ll be more like the 2019 or 2020 Gardner Minshew, though. It would be smart not to give Minshew responsibilities on the offense before he earns them.     Eagles just landed a 25-year old QB that has completed 62.9% with 37 TD, only 11 INT, and 93.1% rating in his first two seasons for a stinking 6th round pick. Gardner Minshew is a winning NFL quarterback. Absolute no-brainer deal for Howie Roseman.‚Äî Jim Nagy (@JimNagy_SB) August 28, 2021 Jacksonville dropped the ball with Gardner Minshew Giving up a sixth-round pick for a QB with 5,530 passing yards and 37 passing TDs in two years is a steal and says more about the dysfunction and uncertainty in Jacksonville than Philadelphia. The so-called QB competition seemed like an act to boost Minshew\'s trade value, which failed obviously and leaves HC Urban Meyer to be criticized for such a move. Still, Philadelphia does well to have extra options at QB, something they\'ve been known to do over the years.     Despite playing 13 less full games, Jalen Hurts had more 300+ passing yard performances than Baker Mayfield.In Hurts‚Äô 3 game stretch of full starts, he also averaged more YPG, TD per game, and had a higher Comp %.#Eagles pic.twitter.com/mpF8OkEpb4‚Äî Eagles Nation (@PHLEaglesNation) August 23, 2021 Jalen Hurts has potential, but needs to utilize it early in 2021 Jalen Hurts is still just 23 with only four career starts, even though it may feel he\'s played more than that. A 1-3 record isn\'t great and neither is a 52% completion rate, 6 TDs, and four INTs. The upside is that he\'s shown he can lead, the offense respects him, and he\'s had 300+ yards in two of his four starts. He\'s played much better in training camp, but he really needed the reps in the preseason regardless of the Eagles wanting to rest him to prevent an injury. Jalen Hurts\' small amount of playing time in his career isn\'t large enough to really allow him to have a long leash as a starter and he will be under the microscope. While Gardner Minshew\'s arrival isn\'t a formal answer to Jalen Hurts losing his starting job, it does prove the Eagles feel they need to have suitable options on the depth chart. Don\'t bet on Philadelphia having a winning season in 2021.     ', 'Throwback to the last 5 NFL Super Bowls  It\'s that time of the year again.

Super Bowl LII (2018) Super Bowl LII: Philadelphia Eagles vs. New England Patriots This game saw the Eagles top the New England Patriots 41-33 in a thrilling game. After leading almost the entire game, the Eagles gave up the lead early in the fourth quarter, trailing 33-32, before back-to-back scores led to victory.     Quarterback Nick Foles had a standout performance, earning the MVP award. His teammates, Corey Clement and Nelson Agholor, were also impressive. One of the highlights was the ""Philly Special"" trick play executed on a crucial fourth down in the second quarter. 2. Super Bowl LIII (2019) Pittsburgh Steelers vs. New England Patriots The Patriots secured back-to-back appearances in the final game to take on the Los Angeles Rams. In contrast to Super Bowl LII, the 53rd NFL championship match was a low-scoring affair. In fact, early in the last quarter, the score was tied at 3-3.     Eventually, though, New England broke the deadlock with a touchdown followed by a field goal to win 13-3. Quarterback Tom Brady won his sixth Super Bowl ring. This game broke records for being the lowest-scoring Super Bowl game in history, with the two teams scoring a combined total of 16 points. 3. Super Bowl LIV (2020) Super Bowl LIV: San Francisco 49ers vs. Kansas City Chiefs This was a highly anticipated NFL game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Chiefs. It was the first time Chiefs\' rising superstar Patrick Mahomes reached the Super Bowl. The 49ers also had a lot of talent in this matchup, with Jimmy Garoppolo under center and Raheem Mostert and Deboo Samuels part of the offense.     The game started off balanced. At halftime, the score was tied at 10 points each. Mahomes threw two interceptions in the third quarter, and San Francisco scored 10 points from the turnovers to take a massive lead. But Kansas City scored 21 points in the last quarter, thanks to two turnovers by the 49ers. The Chiefs came out on top 31-20 as Patrick Mahomes earned the MVP award.

The Rams had a stacked roster after going all in on the season with multiple midseason acquisitions. The teams were evenly matched, and going into the fourth quarter, the Bengals led by four points. After both sides punted a few times, the Rams got the ball back with five minutes left. They drove the ball 79 yards with 15 plays in less than four minutes to score a touchdown and grab the lead. The Bengals tried to tie it up with a field goal, but after a controversial pass attempt on fourth-and-1 that was incomplete, the Rams prevailed 23-20. This was the first time the Rams won the Super Bowl since moving from St. Louis to Los Angeles. Next up in the NFL: Super Bowl LVIIThe past five Super Bowls have been filled with unforgettable moments and memorable performances. As we gear up for the upcoming Super Bowl between the Chiefs and the Eagles, it\'s exciting to reflect on these NFL games and the talented athletes who have graced the field. Let\'s see what memories the next Super Bowl will bring.     ', 'Mike White benched: 4 one-game wonders from NFL history\xa0  The NFL\'s latest passing sensation was literally a passing sensation.  Mike White\'s stranglehold on the football-loving public\'s imagination is over, as the New York Jets announced that they would start Joe Flacco for their Sunday contest against the Miami Dolphins (1 p.m. ET, CBS). White put in a literal Hall of Fame performance on Oct. 31 against the Cincinnati Bengals, becoming the first NFL quarterback to throw for 400 yards and three touchdowns in his first career start.

However, reality intervened in the form of the Buffalo Bills, who victimized White for four interceptions in a 45-17 loss. Flacco led the Jets to their final score in the fourth quarter and returned to New York after spending the most recent preseason in Philadelphia.

Many would probably expect legends like Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, George Blanda, and Y.A. Tittle to appear on the list. Others, like Nick Foles and Joe Kapp, were able to carve professional football legacies beyond their high-scoring affairs but the addition of Adrian Burk is one that will certainly raise eyebrows among non-football historians.     Burk was the second overall pick of the 1950 NFL Draft but spent a relatively uneventful seven seasons with the Colts and Eagles. But an October 1954 afternoon with the latter helped him make history, as he threw seven touchdowns on only 27 attempts in a 49-21 win over Washington, becoming the first to earn that historic tally. That triumph was one of only 15 victories Burk would earn as a starter in his NFL career. Despite his history in a helmet, Burk is perhaps better known for his officiating endeavors as a back judge. Ironically, he was present when Kapp pulled off the feat in 1969. Burk was also part of the officiating crew for Franco Harris\' Immaculate Reception during the 1972-73 playoffs.

A 41-34 win for the Cleveland Browns over the Kansas City Chiefs featured over 900 yards of offense, 286 of which came from Browns running back Jerome Harrison. Harrison\'s tally was good for the third-best single-game rushing tally in NFL history. To put that in perspective, Harrison tallied only 301 total over the first 13 games of the 2008 season. That was enough for Cleveland to bring him back on a new contract and grant him the top rushing duties for the following season. Alas, Harrison was traded to Philadelphia in October of the following year. He was nearly sent back to the Eagles after signing with Detroit over the offseason, but he failed his physical after Philadelphia doctors discovered a brain tumor. Some expected Harrison to be a quadraplegic after the ordeal, but he has since regained most of his motor skills through a rigorous recovery process.

Titletown\'s single-game record for passing yards and touchdowns is held by Flynn, a seventh-round pick of the Packers in the 2008 draft. Flynn had made a single start entering Week 17 of the 2011-12 NFL season, when he was called upon to relieve a resting Rodgers before the top-seeded Packers began their playoff trek. Despite the relative lack of stakes, Flynn wowed audiences with a 480-yard, six-touchdown showing as the Packers earned a 45-41 victory over the Detroit Lions.     Flynn\'s output was enough to convince the Seattle Seahawks to shell out the big bucks: a three-year, $20.5 million contract awaited in the ensuing offseason, along with the implication that Flynn was the team\'s new franchise man. Alas for Flynn, the drafting of a third-round pick named Russell Wilson changed everything. He lasted only two more seasons in the NFL after that, a stretch that included a return to Green Bay in 2013-14. Gray scores one of his four touchdowns in the win over the Colts (Photo: Getty) 11/16/14: Gray Matter It has become a tiring NFL cliche/meme to say that Bill Belichick can win with anyone. But that axiom rang dangerously true during a November 2014 prime-time contest between Belichick\'s New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts.     With regular rushers Stevan Ridley and LeGarrette Blount unavailable, the Patriots bestowed their duties on Gray. That Sunday night\'s showdown against the Colts was the one-month anniversary of his promotion to the Patriots\' active roster. He went on to torch the Colts for 201 rushing yards and four scores, becoming the first player in the NFL\'s modern era to earn a touchdown quartet after entering the game with none. New England would win the game 42-20 and Gray earned cover duties for the ensuing week\'s issue of Sports Illustrated. Alas, Belichick giveth and Belichick taketh away: Gray took the costliest nap of his life during the ensuing week of practice, as his oversleeping made him late for practice after his phone died. Gray was originally suspended for a ""violation of team rules"" after the incident, but wound up being a healthy scratch in all but four of the Patriots\' remaining games that season. He was released by the Patriots at the end of training camp in 2015 and failed to catch on in Miami or Jacksonville.

81,Drew Brees,"[""NFL Rumor: Is Drew Brees retiring?  As the clock hit zeros and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers began to celebrate every New Orleans Saints fan started to think about life after Drew Brees. It had been a big topic all week in the NFL if Drew Brees was going to retire after the 2021 NFL Playoffs. Looking at his demeanor and his reaction it is safe to say that Drew Brees may have played his last game behind center for the Saints.  If Drew Brees were to come back to the Saints in the 2021 NFL Season it would be because of the way he lost on Sunday. Brees would put out his worst performance of the 2020-2021 NFL Season against the Buccaneers. Drew Brees would only throw for 134 yards and one touchdown.        The stat that will haunt him is the three interceptions that he threw on Sunday against the Bucs. This is the most he has thrown all season and almost matched the total he threw all season in 2019.            New Orleans Saints fans will be sitting on the edge of their seats waiting to hear if Drew Brees will stay or walk away.  Why Drew Brees will retire this off-season Let's not forget that the 20 year veteran suffered a horrific injury that caused him to collapse his lung. Brees is 42 years old and the injuries now take longer to heal. He has done everything and more in his NFL career and will be in the Hall of Fame. EMOTIONAL PHOTOS: Saints Quarterback Drew Brees did the only thing he knew to do after a loss like that against the Bucs last night...spend two hours with his family after the game in the endzone. ‚öúÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/yOg9s4MU7X‚Äî wdsu (@wdsu) January 18, 2021     Brees has won a Super Bowl and has been successful his entire NFL career. The questions that he will ask himself this off-season. What else can I do? Am I 100% okay with never playing another snap? What are the benefits of me coming back?These are all questions that Brees will have to answer within himself. Drew Brees is a family man and has a wife and children that will have a say in what he decides to do with his decision. With the injury and all the success he has had it would make sense for him to walk away. No one can blame him for wanting to retire. He gave the NFL 20 great years.

All NFL fans want to say is Thank you for 20 years of great football. Thank you for showing that size doesn't matter at the quarterback position. Finally, thank you for playing for the love of football.     "", ""Was 2010 really Drew Brees‚Äô peak? Revisiting former Saints QB‚Äôs Super Bowl MVP-winning season  Drew Brees retired as the quarterback with the most passing yards and touchdowns. Although Tom Brady has now overtaken most of his records, in terms of yards per game, Brees is still higher than everyone on the list. To reach such a level, you need to be consistently good and not just be good for a couple of seasons.  What would be a good starting point if we wanted to determine Brees' peak? Brees never won the league MVP award, which was an outlier in an otherwise fantastic career. But he did win a Super Bowl in 2010 and took home the Super Bowl MVP award as well. The question is whether that can be considered his peak.        From a personal achievement standpoint, there can be nothing greater for an NFL player than lifting the Lombardi Trophy and getting that ring. But as we all know, quarterbacks alone cannot win the Super Bowl. To judge Drew Brees' peak, we have to look at the stats.           Drew Brees' stats: when did he reach peak performance? Drew Brees played very well compared to most other quarterbacks in the league in 2010, the season he won the Super Bowl. He threw for 4,620 yards but only for 33 touchdowns, one fewer than a year prior. He also threw 22 interceptions, the highest of his career. His passer rating was just 90.9. Between that season and until his retirement, he never had a worse passer rating in any season. So, quite clearly, 2010 did not see Drew Brees at his best. His peak must instead lie between 2011 and 2016, because in those six seasons, he crossed more than 300 passing yards per game. But even from there, there is one season that stands out.     Right after winning the Super Bowl, Brees embarked on the most productive season of his career in 2011. He threw for 5,476 yards and for 46 touchdowns (both career highs). His 14 interceptions were far fewer than they were a season earlier. He ended up with a quarterback rating of 110.6. If indeed Drew Brees reached a peak, it was in this year. However, he was defeated in the MVP stakes by one Aaron Rodgers, who set the NFL record with a passer rating of 122.5 that season. The right way to talk about Drew Brees is not so much a peak as an extremely high valley. Between 2011 and 2016, he threw for more than 5,000 yards in four of those six seasons. In the two years he did not reach that mark, he still had more than 4,800 yards. He also threw for more than 40 touchdowns in consecutive seasons in 2011 and 2012. For those who swear by passer ratings, they could point out that his peak came later on beginning in 2015. Since that year and until his retirement, his passer rating never fell below 100. His touchdown output dropped as he aged, but he became more mature as well, throwing far fewer interceptions. If anyone wanted to consider both the passer rating and his yardage, 2015 and 2016 were probably the sweet spots.     Adam Levitan@adamlevitanAll-time NFL record for completion percentage in a season:1. Drew Brees 2018 -- 74.4%2. Drew Brees 2019 -- 74.3%*3. Geno Smith 2022 -- 72.8%4. Drew Brees 2017 -- 72.0%*Through 11 games32142 Ultimately, it shows just how good Drew Brees was over such a long period that it is extremely difficult to point out one season of greatness. He was just consistently high-performing and remains the most explosive passer in NFL history. He might never have won the NFL MVP award, but there were very few players who were as fun to watch as Drew Brees.     "", ""New Orleans Saints stop Tom Brady in defensive performance  Tom Brady has had an epic career, as well as an epic start to the 2021-2022 NFL season. But that all came to a crashing halt during last night's jaw-dropping shutout loss to the New Orleans Saints by a score of 9-0.  Although the Saints' offense was also limited by an offense quarterbacked by Taysom Hill and without head coach Sean Payton, out because of testing positive for COVID, their defense did what it typically does against Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which baffles them beyond epic proportions.        Tampa Bay Buccaneers@BuccaneersGoing to come back better.#GoBucs12:30 PM ¬∑ Dec 20, 202135231           The Saints were able to pull off a defensive performance for the ages against the NFL's highest scoring offense. Tom Brady was held in check against the Saints in a performance not replicated in 15 years New Orleans Saints v Tampa Bay Buccaneers     On Sunday Night Football, the New Orleans Saints did the unthinkable: limit Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers offense to zero points for the entire game. This feat has not been done to Tom Brady in 15 years, since the Miami Dolphins shut out Brady's New England Patriots by a score of 21-0. As an aside, the head coach of those 2006 Miami Dolphins was none other than Nick Saban, the current head coach and conductor of the University of Alabama's college football dynasty. Saban is also a disciple of Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, so perhaps it's not that much of a surprise that it was that team that last shut out Brady. The record for a quarterback not being shut out in an NFL game currently sits at 255 games and is held by former New Orleans Saints quarterback and current NBC Sunday Night Football analyst Drew Brees. Ironically, it was Brees's former team that did a number on Brady and the Buccaneers' offense. The front four constantly sent pressure and collapsed the pocket around Brady, which is universally known as kryptonite for the seven-time Super Bowl champion.     And not to take away from a great defensive game from the Saints' defense, but during the course of the game, the Buccaneers also lost receivers Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and running back Leonard Fournette. Ian Rapoport@RapSheet#Bucs WR Chris Godwin, who suffered an MCL sprain, is expected to miss the rest of the regular season, source said. With three games left, Injured Reserve makes sense. Godwin should be able to return for the playoffs, which obviously is most important.10:21 AM ¬∑ Dec 20, 20212626479 The outlook for the Buccaneers may appear bleak after shooting blanks against the Saints. But they hope to have Godwin back for the playoffs and also look forward to the return of Antonio Brown, who has been suspended for the past three games for misrepresenting his COVID vaccination status by allegedly using a fake vaccination card.     And although Sunday wasn't his best game, it never hurts to have Tom Brady on your side when the chips are down.Also Read: What happened to Buccaneers WR Chris Godwin?

Sean Payton's team may have already qualified for the playoffs, but they came undone against the rejuvenated Philadelphia Eagles last week. Despite a much-improved performance in the second half, the Saints lost by a final score of 24-21. New Orleans will need to start this game against the Chiefs with a lot more pep in their step if they hope to come away with the win.        Over in the AFC, the Chiefs reign supreme. Andy Reed's team managed to escape Miami with a victory last week. The Dolphins rallied late in the game, but Kansas City ultimately secured a 33-27 win.

Drew Brees would finish out that series by throwing a three-yard touchdown pass to running back Alvin Kamara. The Saints defense would get the ball back for the Saints offense and Drew Brees would take a knee to end the first half. This would be the last time we'd see Drew Brees for that game.     Taysom Hill is expected to start his fourth consecutive game at QB for the Saints on Sunday vs. Philly.

The former New Orleans Saints quarterback has done it all and won it all. He even has a ring and Super Bowl MVP award to show for his performances over the years. However, he was never awarded the regular season MVP award.  Drew Brees celebrating the New Orleans Saints' Super Bowl XLIV win with his son and family        So how is it so that the Super Bowl-winning future Hall of Fame QB has never won the award? Well, he's gone as close as one can get by being named runner-up for the award as many as four times (2006, 2009, 2011, and 2018). So what's stopped him from winning the award? Let's go back and see how he fared against the winner of the MVP title whenever he was placed as the runner-up.           LaDainian Tomlinson (2006) LaDainian Tomlinson bulldozed his way to the award in 2006 with 44 out of a possible 50 votes. Rushing for a career-high 1,815 yards and scoring 28 touchdowns, Drew Brees' former Los Angeles Chargers teammate secured the award with ease. Peyton Manning (2009) In another landslide loss, the 13-time Pro Bowler was bested by then-Indianapolis Colts star Peyton Manning. The older Manning brother snagged 37.5 points while Brees could only garner 7.5. Some argued that this was tough on Brees, who statistically had a better season than Manning that season.        Aaron Rodgers (2011) Two years later, Drew Brees was back knocking on the door with a record-shattering campaign. The New Orleans Saints quarterback threw for 5,476 yards, smashing the passing record set by Miami Dolphins legend Dan Marino in 1984. Rodgers, though, walked away with the award thanks to a stellar showing himself. His landslide 48-vote win was definitely something no one saw coming. ALSO READ: Will Aaron Rodgers ever win another MVP award? Patrick Mahomes (2018) Nearing the end of his career, the future Hall of Famer took one more shot at the most valuable player title. However, he ended up losing to Kansas CIty Chiefs' QB sensation Patrick Mahomes.      Did Drew Brees deserve to win NFL MVP award? A case can certainly be made for Drew Brees for an MVP shout. One could argue that 2009 was when the quarterback deserved it the most thanks to his standout performances in the regular season. The Saints star, after all, had one more touchdown, five fewer interceptions, and a passer rating way higher than Manning's that season.    Another season to consider would be his 2011 loss to Rodgers. The quarterback had over 300 more passing yards and one more touchdown, but it was perhaps the Packers QB's impeccable 45-6 TD-INT record that swayed voters toward him.The Saints quarterback still holds multiple franchise and league records. Having won nearly everything there is to win, the only blip on the retired superstar's legacy will forever remain among the NFL's biggest anomalies.     "", ""NFL Trade Rumors: Should the Houston Texans pursue Teddy Bridgewater?  The Carolina Panthers have been the most talked-about team when it comes to landing Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson. With the recent lawsuits that have been placed against Watson, it's going to be tough to get him at the moment. Deshaun Watson has made it known that he has no problem sitting out until the Texans trade him.  Houston recently added former Los Angeles Chargers back-up quarterback Tyrod Taylor, but it's hard to believe the Texans will enter the 2021-2022 NFL season with him as their starting quarterback. Instead of the Panthers pursuing the Texans starting quarterback, Houston would be wise to pursue Teddy Bridgewater to start while Watson sits.

He struggles when the weight of a franchise is on his shoulders. When he started for the New Orleans Saints in 2019, Bridgewater went (5-0) as a starter. Back then, there was no question that Bridgewater was a temporary starter until Drew Brees returned from injury. His performance in the 2019-2020 NFL season landed him a big payday with Carolina, and Bridgewater held the weight of the Carolina Panthers franchise on his shoulders. They finished the 2020-2021 NFL season with a (4-11) record. If the Houston Texans pursue Teddy Bridgewater through a trade, they could be getting the same version of Bridgewater that played for New Orleans. The Texans have made it known that Deshaun Watson is their quarterback and that is not changing. This will take the spotlight off of Bridgewater.

Outside of his rookie year and last season, Teddy Bridgwater doesn't turn the football over often.

82,Sam Darnold,"['NFL 2020: New York Jets stay winless after Sam Darnold\'s poor performance  Things just keep getting worse for the New York Jets.  The team at the bottom of everyone\'s NFL power ranking fell to 0-7 with Sunday\'s 18-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills. The Jets are the league\'s only winless team, and the two people taking the most heat for that are head coach Adam Gase and quarterback Sam Darnold.        The No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Darnold has not lived up to expectations by any measure. There are other young QBs who are surrounded by teams with talent deficiencies -- Joe Burrow (Bengals), Justin Herbert (Chargers) and Daniel Jones (Giants) come to mind -- but they\'re doing better individually than Darnold.           On Sunday, Darnold completed 12 of 23 passes for 120 yards, with no touchdowns and two interceptions. His Quarterback Rating was 17.6 (out of a possible 100) and his Passer Rating was 31.1 (out of a possible 158.3). Jerry went OFF.@Iam_jerryhughes | #BUFvsNYJ pic.twitter.com/kzD4QclwC1‚Äî Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) October 26, 2020     Gase did his part in post-game interviews to shield his quarterback from blame. The Jets\' offensive line was called out by Gase. ""It was collapsing quick on him,"" the coach was quoted by ESPN,"" noting that Darnold ""didn\'t have a lot of time to throw the ball."" Gase added, ""If you look at it statistically, we\'re not good anywhere statistically."" Can the Jets continue with Adam Gase and Sam Darnold? Some of the blame for that has to go to Gase. He\'s the one who played a big hand in the Jets getting rid of All-Pro running back Le\'Veon Bell a couple weeks ago. Bell was signed by the Jets last year and made the highest-paid running back in the NFL. But Gase reportedly never wanted Bell on the team and couldn\'t figure out how to best use the talented runner.     Any time, any place.@LeVeonBell is ready to ball. pic.twitter.com/w6MLLizWap‚Äî New York Jets (@nyjets) January 31, 2020 Gase came to New York with a reputation as a quarterback guru and offensive genius. But now in his second season with the team, the Jets have the NFL\'s worst offense and their franchise QB is failing. No one would be surprised if the Jets fire Gase at the end of this season. If they are bad enough to land the No. 1 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, no one would be surprised if they use that pick on another quarterback -- probably Clemson\'s Trevor Lawrence -- and put the Darnold era behind them.     Before that, these Jets just need to get a win (or two).This week doesn\'t look good for that, as they face the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs on the road.After that, however, the Jets have three straight winnable games against the New England Patriots, Los Angeles Chargers and Miami Dolphins.     ', 'NFL analyst on Panthers QB competition between Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnold  The Carolina Panthers were in the market for a quarterback and traded for Baker Mayfield this offseason. They sent the Cleveland Browns a conditional fifth-round pick in the 2024 draft in return.   Carolina will enter training camp with two of the top three picks from the 2018 NFL Draft. Mayfield was selected by the Browns first overall and Sam Darnold was taken third by the New York Jets.        The trade has been well received by the majority of NFL fans, with most thinking it will work out well for both Mayfield and Carolina. But not everyone sees it as a net positive for the Panthers.           On The Ringer NFL Podcast, analyst Roger Sherman said that the quarterback battle between Mayfield and Darnold hurts his soul. ‚ÄúThere are only a handful of actual legit quarterback battles and to be far and away the one that just hurts me in my soul the most is the Carolina Panthers."" He continued: ""Those two guys who were, just a few years ago, hot NFL draft prospects that went number one and number three picks back in 2018.‚Äù        Sherman thinks that Mayfield will likely win the starting job over Darnold. ‚ÄúOne will be a backup to the other most likely Sam Darnold. Because Sam Darnold is like legit really bad and Baker Mayfield is just kind of, like not good for having been a number one pick. It\'s probably going to be Baker over Sam.‚Äù He concluded by saying: ""Unless something weird happens, it\'s just bad vibes for everybody involved."" Mayfield started 59 games in four seasons with the Browns, throwing for 14,125 yards, 92 touchdowns and 56 interceptions. He finished second in the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year voting in his rookie season and led the Browns to their first postseason win of the millennium. Sportskeeda Pro Football@SKProFootballRich Eisen scoffs at thought of Baker Mayfield losing quarterback competition to Sam Darnold dlvr.it/SVDzFL     Darnold started 38 games for the Jets. He threw for 8,097 yards with 45 touchdowns and 39 interceptions in three seasons in New York. They traded him to Carolina in April last year. Who will be the Panthers\' starter in 2022?  Oklahoma Spring Game This quarterback race may not be as riveting as some others across the NFL, as it seems that Mayfield has the edge over Darnold. Darnold started 11 games for the Panthers last season but suffered a cracked scapula in his throwing arm, missing six games. He threw nine touchdown passes and 13 interceptions.        Mayfield has more career starts under his belt than Darnold and has shown that he could be a viable starter in the NFL. Most are expecting Baker Mayfield to be the starting quarterback for the franchise in 2022. This is unless injury, or Sam Darnold\'s performance, forces him to the sidelines. Ari Meirov@MySportsUpdate#Panthers QB Baker Mayfield says the way everything unfolded in Cleveland this offseason was unexpected and left him shocked.Asked if he doesn\'t get enough credit for getting the Browns to the playoffs after all the suffering they had: ""I\'m not a me guy. I\'m a team first guy.""1698101     Should the former Oklahoma Sooners quarterback get the nod to start Week One of the 2022 season, he‚Äôll face the Browns at home.

Notably, several San Francisco 49ers players were in attendance at the game.   Throughout the broadcast, cameras showed several current and former 49ers players watching the action from the stands.

Stephen Curry had a double-double of 20 points and 12 assists, while JaMychal Green contributed 15 points. Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green both scored 11 points, with the latter also recording 11 rebounds and nine assists.  Rookie Moses Moody also had a solid performance off the bench with 10 points. Defensively, the Warriors were able to contain Anthony Davis, who was held to just 11 points and seven rebounds after his 30-point, 23-rebound Game 1 performance.  LeBron James had 23 points, but only one field goal in the second half, while D'Angelo Russell was limited to 10 points and failed to connect from beyond the arc in his three attempts. Can the San Francisco 49ers return to the Super Bowl in 2023?     2023 marks a new era for the 49ers, as it will mark their first season without long-time quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, who has left for the Las Vegas Raiders. In his place, Lance, Darnold, and sensational Mr. Irrelevant Brock Purdy are expected to compete for the QB1 job, though Purdy appears to be the frontrunner.Garoppolo is not the only major departure from the 49ers. They have also lost right tackle Mike McGlinchey and cornerback Emmanuel Moseley. However, they did gain veteran defensive tackle Javon Hargrave and cornerback Isaiah Oliver, among others. It will be interesting to see whether these new additions will return the team to the Super Bowl this season.     "", 'Report reveals Browns player was unhappy with Baker Mayfield\'s poor performance in training  Baker Mayfield is currently facing a battle for his NFL future, which lies in limbo. He remains on the Cleveland Browns\' roster despite the franchise making it abundantly clear they will be moving forward with Deshaun Watson as their starting quarterback.  A recent report has questioned Mayfield\'s ability and that he was regularly poor in practice, according to an unnamed Browns player. The information contained a quote from a Browns player. The statement addresses a video Odell Beckham Jr.\'s father released on social media in November last year, showing the quarterback not throwing the ball to his son, who was open on several occasions.                View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post           According to the report, when asked if he had seen the video posted by Beckham Jr.\'s father, the unnamed Browns player gave a scathing response. He said: ""Why would I watch the video? I see it every day in practice."" Offseason Chopz@Pchopz_Oh boy.3417478     This is another negative view that could hinder Mayfield\'s search for a new team. With the NFL Draft ending, the chance for the Browns to move him on to pastures new and focus on the future with a different quarterback have also diminished. The Carolina Panthers were interested in Mayfield, but recent reports have shown that they were never close to a deal with the Browns. The Panthers went on to draft Matt Corral, who will challenge Sam Darnold for the starting job in Charlotte.        Other potential teams that needed a quarterback have made moves to find the piece to the puzzle, with the Pittsburgh Steelers drafting Kenny Pickett and the Seattle Seahawks set to move forward with Drew Lock behind center. Seattle head coach Pete Carroll recently stated that the Seahawks weren\'t looking to add another quarterback \'at all\' to their roster, which puts an end to Seattle being a possible destination for Mayfield.  Why are teams reluctant to make a trade for Baker Mayfield? One of the main hurdles is the quarterback\'s $19 million salary due in 2022. Teams seem reluctant to take on that amount, which reportedly led to the Panthers\' and Browns\' inability to agree on trade terms.   It also seems highly unlikely that Mayfield will stay and offer back-up for Watson as he sees himself as the starting quarterback. Based on the NFL Index quarterback rankings, he ranked 25th out of 62 quarterbacks, with his inconsistency proving to be a significant shortcoming.     ', ""NFL Week 13: Las Vegas Raiders at New York Jets odds, picks, and predictions  The Las Vegas Raiders suffered a 43-6 beatdown last week. They were dominated by Atlanta Falcons in NFL Week 12. But the Raiders catch a break this week. They travel to MetLife Stadium to take on the winless New York Jets. Many fans think this year's Jets could be one of the worst teams in NFL history.  Quarterback Sam Darnold's return did little to aid the Jets' quest for a victory. Darnold struggled to throw the football with any real consistency. After a 20-3 loss to the Miami Dolphins, New York remains stuck at the bottom of the AFC East. The mere fact that veteran running back Frank Gore is still the Jets' most consistent performer says everything you need to know about this deficient offense.        As for coach Jon Gruden's Raiders, everything seemed to go wrong last week. They were unable to run the ball, so they resorted to a one-dimensional passing offense. To beat the Jets, Las Vegas will have to play better on both offense and defense. With a win, the Raiders' playoff chances remain solid.

Over the next couple of weeks, NFL teams will be evaluating their rosters and looking at where they can improve. There are several teams that could use a new quarterback, but will a 32-year-old be the answer?     Washington need a new quarterback; so do the Steelers and the Texans (if Mills is not the answer), and potentially the Seahawks, depending on what Russell Wilson does. The Panthers are still unsure over their options going forward. Sam Darnold started 3-0 this season before the wheels fell off and Cam looked shaky in the offense.

His charisma and stature suggest he needs to be a starter, but there could be only a handful of jobs available, if any; so being a back up could be a viable option.     Since his 2015 MVP season, in which he led the Panthers to a 15-1 record and a Super Bowl appearance, Cam has been on a downwards trajectory. In his MVP year, he threw for 35 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions, but he has not gotten close to those touchdown numbers since. Several teams will see the 32-year-old as a bonafide back-up option should their starter go down. That could even be in Carolina, but the lack of on-field production will cause some hesitation. If Cam is to call it a day and retire from the league, he will go down as one of the most polarizing figures the game has seen.

While it was seen as a good move, many knew it wasn\'t going to be the long-term solution. Thus, Mayfield\'s performances reiterated that.    Baker Mayfield played six games for the Panthers last season and went 1-5 in those games. He threw for only six touchdowns and six interceptions and had a completion percentage of just 57.8.        It was this kind of form that led the Panthers front office to trade up and get the No.1 overall pick and take Bryce Young. Now that they are headed in a new direction, an air of optimism surrounds the organization regarding what Young can bring.Mayfield was a stop gap, and as Fitterer alluded to, if you are going to be paying a quarterback top money, then he will need to be worthy of it, and clearly, they thought neither Mayfield nor Darnold were.

83,Geno Smith,"[""Geno Smith's success in college did not carry over to the NFL  Geno Smith spent four years at West Virginia and put together a great four years for the Mountaineers. Smith sat behind Jarrett Brown in his first year at West Virginia before becoming the full-time starter in his sophomore season. After four years at West Virginia, the New York Jets selected Geno Smith in the second round of the 2013 NFL draft.  When looking at the college career of Geno Smith, it brings a question to mind - why did the success from college not carry over to the NFL?                   Geno Smith's college football career at West Virginia Former West Virginia QB Geno Smith As mentioned above, Geno Smith sat behind starting quarterback Jarrett Brown during his freshman year. Geno Smith was promoted to starter during his sophomore season. His junior and senior seasons at West Virginia were his best college football seasons.      Geno Smith's performance in the Orange Bowl in the 2010-2011 college season will go down as one of the best. West Virginia still holds the record for the most points scored in the Orange Bowl game itself with 70. Geno Smith recorded a completion percentage of 74.4% and threw for 407 passing yards with six touchdowns. Smith also added a rushing touchdown to his totals during the 2011 Orange Bowl game. Geno Smith accounted for seven touchdowns against the Clemson Tigers. West Virginia ended winning the shoot out 70-33 over Clemson in 2011. Here is a look at what Geno Smith was able to do at West Virginia. Geno Smith's Career Stats at West Virginia -- Completions: 988 -- Attempts: 1,465 -- Completion percentage: 67.4% -- Passing yards: 11,662 yards -- Touchdowns: 98 -- Interceptions: 21  What happened to Geno Smith in the NFL? Former New York Jets QB Geno Smith     Geno Smith spent his first four seasons in the NFL with the New York Jets. He did not last long as the starting quarterback for the Jets. After two seasons of starting, he was replaced. Geno Smith has only started two games since the 2014 NFL season. In two seasons as the Jets starting quarterback, Geno Smith threw a total of 34 interceptions. He was sacked a total of 71 times in his first two seasons.  Since being drafted by the New York Jets in the 2013 draft, he has spent time with three different teams. Smith is currently the back up quarterback to Russell Wilson in Seattle. Geno Smith only appeared in one game in 2020 for the Seahawks.     The main reason to why Geno Smith has not carried over his success from college into the NFL is because of his turnovers. Smith has thrown a total of 36 interceptions during his NFL career. Some fans may say that the New York Jets are the reason why Geno Smith failed. This could be true, but the Jets were not on the field making the throws. Geno Smith threw for over 11,000 yards in college. He has failed to reach 7,000 passing yards in seven NFL seasons.Geno Smith will be 31 years old entering the 2021 NFL season. His opportunity window to be a starting quarterback in the NFL has shut. It will be interesting to see how the rest of his NFL career turns out.     "", ""Who is Geno Smith? Which teams has the Seattle Seahawks quarterback played for in the past?  Geno Smith is all the rage after his performance for the Seattle Seahawks against the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday Night Football.  The Seahawks backup quarterback led the team on two scoring drives after Russell Wilson went off injured. The first was a 72-yard drive that led to a touchdown. The other led to a field goal.        Ian Rapoport@RapSheetThe Geno Smith game.8:15 AM ¬∑ Oct 8, 20217280512           It was a great performance from a quarterback who had not seen much playing time with his current team prior to that. We look at the journey that has led him to this place and all the other teams he has played for. Teams Geno Smith played for before the Seattle Seahawks Geno Smith began his career at the New York Jets or, as is otherwise known, the graveyard of promising quarterbacks coming out of college. He was drafted in the second round of the 2013 NFL draft after impressing in West Virginia, where he led the Mountaineers to multiple bowl games in his college career.     In his rookie season, Smith competed with Mark Sanchez for the QB role, before being named the starter after Sanchez suffered a shoulder injury. He struggled throughout the season but showed improvement when the Jets won three out of their final four games. It was enough for him to be named starter for the 2014 season. His 2014 was a minor improvement on his rookie season. Prior to the 2015 season, he was involved in an altercation with teammate IK Enemkpali, that led to him fracturing his jaw. In his absence, Ryan Fitzpatrick took over and led the New York Jets to a 2-0 record, thereby taking Geno Smith's position as a starter.  Smith remained the backup throughout 2015 and 2016, and when he finally got his chance in the latter, he tore his ACL, which ruled him out for the remainder of that season.  In 2017, Geno Smith signed with the New York Giants, where his most noteworthy contribution was being named starter against the Oakland Raiders, which broke Eli Manning's 210-game streak as the starting quarterback. He could not impress in the game, however, and was benched the very next week.     He played the 2018 season with the Los Angeles Chargers and appeared mostly in relief roles. He featured in a total of five games during the season. Geno@GenoSmith3Love this team! Love this city! Winning is all that matters.

He finally got his chance to impress this week against the Los Angeles Rams. If Wilson is sidelined, this could be the start of an extended run as their starting quarterback.     "", ""NFL Draft Rumors: Seahawks want star Anthony Richardson as Geno Smith's successor in post-Russell Wilson era  Host of Pro Football Talk Mike Florio has floated the possibility of Anthony Richardson going to the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks currently hold the fifth overall selection in the 2023 NFL Draft, thanks to a trade that sent Russell Wilson to the Denver Broncos.  If that happens, Seattle hopes that Richardson can eventually become a better option than Geno Smith. The Seahawks gave Smith a three-year, $75 million contract due to his impressive performance during the 2022 season.         The West Virginia alumnus earned his first Pro Bowl selection by tallying career highs of 4,282 yards, 30 touchdowns, and a 69.8 completion percentage.           However, Smith‚Äôs new contract involves an opt-out after the 2023 season. Therefore, there‚Äôs a chance that he could last for just one more season in Seattle if he doesn‚Äôt match or exceed his 2022 numbers.  Improving from that solid season could be difficult, but it gives the Seahawks a nice option at quarterback while Richardson learns from the sidelines. If the Seattle Seahawks decide to move forward with Anthony Richardson, they must part ways with Smith before the fifth league day of 2024. If they don‚Äôt, he will earn a $9.6 million roster bonus on top of his $12.7 million base salary. Smith‚Äôs $31.2 million cap hit for 2023 limits their salary cap flexibility. What the Seahawks will get from Anthony Richardson Anthony Richardson     Anthony Richardson is among the most highly touted quarterback prospects in the 2023 NFL Draft, alongside Bryce Young, CJ Stroud, and Will Levis. While Young and Stroud are projected to be selected early in the first round, there‚Äôs no certainty where Richardson and Levis might land. The team drafting Richardson will get a dual-threat quarterback, similar to the mold of Lamar Jackson, Kyler Murray, Justin Fields, and Jalen Hurts. Richardson finished his final year at Florida with 2,549 yards and 17 passing touchdowns. He also added 654 yards from the ground and nine rushing touchdowns. Richardson ran the 40-yard dash in this year‚Äôs Scouting Combine in 4.43 seconds. He also had a 10‚Äô9‚Äù broad jump and a 40.5-inch vertical. There‚Äôs merit in Florio‚Äôs revelation, considering how Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll prioritizes the run game. Having Richardson and Kenneth Walker III gives him multiple ball carriers that opposing defenses must pay attention to.However, Anthony Richardson‚Äôs passing accuracy needs improvement. He had completion percentages of 59.4 and 53.8 in his two seasons as a starter with the Gators. That‚Äôs a work in progress if they decide to select him at number five.     "", 'Russell Wilson who? Geno Smith is officially the future for Seahawks  Geno Smith and the Seattle Seahawks have officially been sent home after losing to the San Francisco 49ers in the opening round of the postseason. Seattle did score 23 points, but gave up 41 in a dominating performance by Brock Purdy and the 49ers offense.  Losing in the playoffs is obviously frustrating and not what the Seahawks had in mind. However, there are plenty of positives to take from the entire season, mainly at the quarterback position.        Geno Smith answered an important question in 2022           Los Angeles Rams v Seattle Seahawks Russell Wilson leaving Seattle could have marked a major rebuilding period getting underway. Instead, Smith won the job and picked up a statement win in Week 1 over Wilson and the Denver Broncos. The well-traveled quarterback finished the regular season with 30 touchdowns and over 4,200 yards. He was not just good, he was great. Bob Condotta@bcondottaGeno Smith says he wants to finish his career in Seattle.1060105     Cut to Saturday and he was trying to do the impossible, which was go on the road and take down the mighty 49ers. To Smith\'s credit, he did finish with 253 yards and two touchdowns. However, he had a costly interception in a game when zero mistakes were allowed if they wanted to pull off the upset. Yet the quarterback proved his worth this year and is still only 32 years old. Keep in mind the Seahawks have the No. 5 pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, thanks to the Wilson trade with Denver. This creates the possibility of taking a top quarterback prospect, such as Bryce Young, CJ Stroud, or Will Levis. However, taking a rookie may mean a rebuild is in fact in place. Why take an unproven rookie when a 32-year-old talented quarterback is already an option?

Yet he is not going to touch the top tier of the market, meaning he can be retained and the Seahawks can use that early pick for another position of need, such as on the offensive line. Throwing for 30 touchdowns is no fluke. He waited for his second act in the NFL and elevated a Seattle team that could have easily focused on draft position this season. A full offseason preparing as the starter will only help, which retaining him sends a message to the team that the goal is still to compete in 2023.Seeing the way Smith played compared to Wilson this season should tell the Seahawks front office all they need to know about their 2023 plans. They made a smart move and should stick with it.

Next, he spent the 2017 season in the same city, playing for the New York Giants. Smith ended Eli Manning's streak of 210 consecutive starts that season. The signal-caller took his talents to the West Coast for the Los Angeles Chargers for the 2018 season.        Like his time with the Giants, Smith started one game and played one season with the Chargers. As mentioned earlier, the former second-round pick joined the Seahawks ahead of the 2019 season.

They recently signed Pro Bowl quarterback Geno Smith to a three-year, $105 million contract and re-signed backup quarterback Drew Lock. The team also focused on improving its defense with several new additions.  Here's a breakdown of the Seahawks' key signings and their impact for the 2023 NFL season.                   Seahawks' free-agency signings so far  Geno Smith, quarterback The Seahawks secured their starting quarterback, Geno Smith, with a three-year contract worth up to $105 million. Smith's impressive 2022 season made him a priority. The Seahawks' commitment to Smith suggests they will focus on improving other areas, but drafting a quarterback in the future is not out of the question. OFFSZN Hawks üíôüíö@Geno4MVPI still don‚Äôt know how Geno Smith was able to throw this ball so perfectly142 Drew Lock, quarterback Seattle re-signed Drew Lock as Geno Smith's backup, appreciating his arm strength, mobility and potential. Lock's one-season deal, with a base value of $4 million, is reasonable for a backup with starting experience. The Seahawks may still draft a quarterback later, but Lock's signing suggests it's not their top priority.     Dre'Mont Jones, defensive dnd The Seahawks made a significant move by signing former Denver Broncos defensive end Dre'Mont Jones to a three-year deal. Jones has been a disruptive interior defender, and his addition addresses a pressing need. Although the deal is expensive, Jones' youth, skillset and production make it a worthwhile investment. 21-3@HackettSZN@MahomeSZN Dremont jones is his daddy3 Julian Love, safety Former New York Giants safety Julian Love joined the Seahawks on a two-year, $12 million deal. Love's signing raises questions about the future of Jamal Adams, who is recovering from surgery. However, Love's contract is more likely an insurance policy for Adams than a replacement.     Jarran Reed, defensive tackle Seattle brought back Jarran Reed on a two-year deal, adding a proven run-stuffer and interior pass-rusher to their defensive line. Reed's signing is a low-risk investment, given his consistent health and productivity throughout his career. Devin Bush, linebacker The Seahawks signed former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Devin Bush to a one-year deal, addressing their need for depth at the position. Although Bush's recent seasons have been inconsistent, his age and potential make this signing a low-risk proposition. Evan Brown, center Seattle signed center Evan Brown to a one-year, $2.25 million deal to address the need for a younger and bigger player in the position. Brown's signing provides a veteran option at center while leaving room for potential draft additions. Phil Haynes, guard The Seahawks re-signed Phil Haynes on a one-year deal worth up to $4 million. Haynes is expected to become a full-time starter, replacing veteran Gabe Jackson. This decision is a sensible move considering Haynes' age, health and recent performance.     Jason Myers, kicker Seattle re-signed Pro Bowl kicker Jason Myers to a four-year deal worth up to $22.6 million with incentives. Myers' new contract makes him the second-highest paid kicker in the NFL, reflecting his importance to the team. Seahawks' notable losses The Seattle Seahawks have experienced notable losses, including key players like Shelby Harris, Rashaad Penny, Gabe Jackson, L.J. Collier and Travis Homer. These departures leave a void the team must address to maintain its competitive edge.Shelby Harris was a versatile defensive lineman, and Rashaad Penny, a talented running back, both had a significant impact on the team. Gabe Jackson provided stability to the offensive line, while L.J. Collier and Travis Homer contributed to the team's defensive and offensive depth, respectively. The Seahawks will need to find suitable replacements to ensure continued success.     "", ""NFL Waiver Wire pickups Week 6  It's always important to utilize waiver wire pickups during each week of every NFL Fantasy Football Season. Building a winning roster for a full season often requires adding reinforcements as the season goes on. This is to account for injuries, bye weeks, and players who are establishing larger or smaller roles for themselves within their NFL team's scheme.  Week 6 of the 2022 Fantasy Football season is the most important waiver wire so far this year because it's the first bye week. Here are some of the top players to target on the Week 6 waiver wire as either streamers or depth pieces.        #1 - QB Geno Smith, Seattle Seahawks           Seattle Seahawks QB Geno Smith Geno Smith continued his breakout season with the Seattle Seahawks with an impressive performance on the road against the New Orleans Saints. This is one of the most difficult stadiums to play in for road teams. He has now thrown multiple touchdowns in four of his five starts after throwing three against the Saints.         Smith is widely thought of as an early-season fluke, but it may be time to start taking him seriously. This translates to Fantasy Football. He currently ranks sixth in fantasy points among all quarterbacks and is the top option at the position who is currently on most waiver wires. #2 - RB Eno Benjamin, Arizona Cardinals Arizona Cardinals RB Eno Benjamin Eno Benjamin took over as the starting running back for the Arizona Cardinals during their Week 5 game. This was due to multiple injuries at the position. James Conner and Darrell Williams, their top two backs, each left the game early and did not return.     Benjamin stepped up by recording 53 yards and a touchdown during the game. He may have earned himself additional touches moving forward and could be the featured running back in Week 6. #3 - RB Kenneth Walker III, Seattle Seahawks Kenneth Walker III - Seattle Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III Kenneth Walker III is one of the most attractive waiver wire pickups in Week 6 of the 2022 Fantasy Football season. Seahawks top running back Rashaad Penny suffered an injury in Week 5 and is expected to miss the remainder of the 2022 NFL season. So Walker will take over as the lead back moving forward.         Walker filled in for Penny in Week 5 following his injury, recording 88 rushing yards on just eight carries. This impressive performance could be a sign of things to come this year. The rookie was one of the most dominant running backs in college football last year and looks ready to shine. #4 - WR Alec Pierce, Indianapolis Colts Indianapolis Colts WR Alec Pierce     The Indianapolis Colts were in desparate need of a second wide receiver behind Michael Pittman entering the 2022 NFL season. They selected Alec Pierce in the 2022 NFL Draft and after a slow first two weeks of his rookie season, he appears to have established himself. Pierce has now exceeded 60 receiving yards in each of his last three games while continuously increasing his workload. He led the Colts in targets, receptions, and yards during their Week 5 game and is now a legitimate waiver wire target in Fantasy Football in Week 6. #5 - WR George Pickens, Pittsburgh Steelers Pittsburgh Steelers WR George Pickens     Since Kenny Pickett took over as the starting quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 4, George Pickens' stock has risen. He has been the top receiver on the team, leading all players in targets, receptions, and yards. Pickett is expected to remain the starter for the rest of the year, so it's time to grab Pickens off the waiver wire in Fantasy Football.     Pickens has recorded six receptions and eight targets in each of his last two games while totaling 185 receiving yards. He and Pickett showed chemistry in training camp and during the 2022 NFL pre-season. They will now carry their production over to the regular season, making him a solid waiver wire target.     #6 - TE Taysom Hill, New Orleans Saints New Orleans Saints TE Taysom Hill Taysom Hill is the definition of a boom or bust player in Fantasy Football. His role within the New Orleans Saints offensive scheme is extremely inconsistent. He is fully capable of little-to-no fantasy points in a given week, but when he booms, he really booms.         Hill offers far more upside than most tight ends, especially considering how weak the position is as a whole for Fantasy Football. He exploded for 112 yards and three touchdowns in Week 5, giving him five total touchdowns this season. He is clearly worth a speculative addition from the waiver wire, possessing the potential to win weeks on his own. #7 - Carolina Panthers Defense Carolina Panthers DB Stephon Gilmore The Carolina Panthers defensive unit is a waiver wire streaming option in Week 6 as they play against the Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford has already thrown seven interceptions during the 2022 NFL season. He has also been sacked 21 times, so the Panthers defense has a great opportunity for a big week.

Revisiting the 2012 Heisman finalists  Geno Smith is the Seattle Seahawks quarterback. He played his ninth season in the NFL and his third with the Seahawks. Smith has also played for the New York Jets, New York Giants and Los Angeles Chargers.  The Jets drafted Smith as the 39th pick (in the second round) in 2013. Before joining the NFL, he starred at West Virginia for four years (2009-2012).        Geno Smith had a 26-13 record in West Virginia. In his senior season, he passed for 4,205 yards and 42 touchdowns, however he was not selected as a Heisman Trophy contender in 2012 despite those numbers.              Instead, Texas A&M star quarterback Johnny Manziel became the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy. Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o and KanState quarterback Collin Klein were the runner-ups. In 2022, Smith became the starting quarterback for the first time in eight years. His only productive years were his first two seasons in the NFL when he played with the New York Jets. From 2015 to 2021, he started in only five out of 15 games.     In 2020, the Seahawks acquired him as a backup to former star Russell Wilson. He hardly got to start any games in his last two seasons, but was named the starting quarterback by the Seahawks for the 2022 season after Wilson left for the Denver Broncos. While many critics questioned the ability of the veteran quarterback to make a comeback, Smith led the Seahawks to the playoffs. He started all 17 regular-season games, going 9-8. He threw for 4,282 yards with 30 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, accounting for his career's best performance so far.

The league's coaches and the Associated Press named him to the All-Big 12 second team.In 2012, he was named the Discover Orange Bowl MVP after leading West Virginia to a 70-33 victory over Clemson by completing 32 of 43 passes (74.4 percent) for 407 yards and six touchdowns.     "", ""Jared Goff or Geno Smith: Who is a better pick?\xa0  Jared Goff has his fans and critics, but both camps would agree to feel sorry for him after the events of the 2021 NFL season. The Los Angeles Rams, the team that drafted Goff first overall in the 2016 NFL Draft, traded him away with a couple of picks to the Detroit Lions for Matthew Stafford. That trade was the catalyst for the Rams' Super Bowl success.   On the other hand, Goff was made to endure a frustrating year at the perennial league punching bag, the Detroit Lions. This season has not been too different from Goff's debut in Detroit, as the shot caller is pulling off a stat line of 1,583 passing yards, 11 touchdowns, and six picks, good for a 52.6 QBR score.        However, Geno Smith is having the best spell of his eight-and-a-half-year NFL career. He is finally fulfilling the promise he showed in college. Geno is a true rennaissance story. The quarterback rose out of the Seattle Seahawks' departed legend Russell Wilson's shadow to become one of the most in-form shot callers in the league so far this 2022 season. Geno Smith is racking up stats of 1,712 passing yards, 11 touchdowns, and three picks, good for a 66.8 QBR score.           Verdict: Geno Smith will be a better pick for your fantasy team. Geno Smith's Seattle Seahawks have a much better record than Jared Goff's Detroit Lions. And judging by the squad depth of both franchises, those records will be similar come the end of the regular season. Quarterback ability greatly affects a franchise's performance, and at the moment, Geno Smith has just too much ability over Jared Goff.          View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     Why Geno Smith is a better fantasy pick than Jared Goff Geno Smith is a better fantasy pick than Jared Goff for many reasons. First, he has more momentum than Goff due to his team's unexpected playoff push in his first year as a starter. Momentum goes a long way in the NFL fantasy league. So we can only look further than the West Virginia alum. Also, there's the team factor, which is directly affected by quarterback play. Smith plays for a team, the Seattle Seahawks, that is better than the Detroit Lions. The Lions have sucked for a long time, while the Seahawks are perennial playoff contenders. You need not be a rocket scientist to know who would finish higher at the end of the season.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     How did Jared Goff and Geno Smith perform last season? Jared Goff and Geno Smith had significantly differing seasons in the 2021 NFL season, with the shot callers playing different roles for their franchises. Jared Goff was a starter for the NFL basement team, the Detroit Lions. He pulled up stats of 3,245 passing yards, 19 touchdowns, and eight picks, good for a 45.5 QBR score in fourteen starts. On the other hand, Geno Smith spent the 2021 NFL season backing up former Seattle Seahawks franchise quarterback Russell Wilson. Hence, his stat line reads 702 passing yards, five touchdowns, and one pick, good for a 45.5 QBR score in four games.         View this post on Instagram            Instagram Post     How have Jared Goff and Geno Smith performed this season? Jared Goff and Geno Smith entered this season with pretty different expectations. Goff was expected to possibly take the Lions to another level that he became accustomed to while with the Los Angeles Rams. Unfortunately, Goff has yet to do that, and the Lions are sitting at the bottom of the league with a 1-5 record. His next game is against Tua Tagovailoa's Miami Dolphins, so it doesn't get easier. On the other hand, Geno Smith outperforms every NFL quarterback not named Josh Allen, Patrick Mahomes, or Joe Burrow. The eight-year veteran has finally hit his stride, and it remains to be seen who will stop him and the Seahawks. Geno Smith has led the Seahawks to a 4-3 start to the season, giving them no need to look into the draft or free agency for a Russell Wilson replacement.              View this post on Instagram            Instagram PostIn their upcoming Week 8 matchup, Geno and the Seahawks are up against the rampant New York Giants. The game will be tough, but anything can happen with Smith being in the best form of his life.     "", 'Geno Smith progresses, Antonio Allen exposed, and other Jets vs Bengals conclusions    The Jets walked away with a 25-17 victory against the Cincinnati Bengals, but the pre-season is all about self-evaluations and play implementation. Not to say that Rex Ryan doesn‚Äôt care about the end result.        Quarterback Geno Smith once again played with greater poise than he did in his rookie season. Throws came out neither rushed nor late. The Jets coaching staff is now allowing him to take shots downfield, and while they aren‚Äôt always connecting, it is a positive sign in their trust in Smith‚Äôs progression.           Smith fired a beauty of a pass towards the end of the first half, but followed it up with a bullet to the Bengals. It did seem, however, that intended receiver David Nelson cut his route short; a miscue that caused the interception. He flashed with his legs on multiple occasions, including a spin out of the pocket, a run in the red zone to set up a Powell score, and a read-option QB-keeper for seven points. A lingering question remains: should Smith improve, will his supporting cast even be enough to form an average or better offense?     The Jets‚Äô safety net at quarterback, veteran Michael Vick, had another respectable showing. Vick finished five of nine for 70 yards and a touchdown. What was most impressive was his verbiage in a post-play interview. His relationship is ‚Äúlike a big brother‚Äù to Geno Smith, and it is more evident now than ever that he is with the Jets to mentor Smith and the rest of his teammates, while being ready anytime his number may be called. Running backs Chris Johnson and Bilal Powell both saw heavy time, with Chris Ivory still sidelined with a rib injury sustained last week. Johnson gained 63 yards on 10 carries and looked as healthy as ever. Powell looked to be in early 2013 form (when he led the AFC in rushing). He contributed 54 total yards and a touchdown. It was his highlight rush for 32 yards that drew the most acclaim. For a team that takes a lot of criticism on offense, the team‚Äôs running back depth chart will have many teams jealous during the regular season.     First-time cornerback Antonio Allen was completely exposed by Bengals WR A.J. Green, and not just because he is a top-tier talent at his position. Green was able to find a wealth of separation ‚Äì sometimes via coverage slips, other times via out-powering his defenders. The blame is not solely on Allen; he was placed into a near unwinnable scenario, with not much of anything in the way of assistance in the secondary. Kyle Wilson had just as poor of a showing, and he was drafted as a first-round corner. Your favorite wideout Stephen Hill found himself in the middle of a little scrap between the teams, but the spark was actually a pleasant surprise from Hill. Get frustrated; I‚Äôd be, too, if I was a second round receiver with his stats the past two seasons, while struggling through injuries. The fiery attitude paid off with a 17 yard reception, his first of the pre-season.     Linebacker Demario Davis had a nice fumble-forcing sack (2nd Q), with the ball being recovered by rookie safety Calvin Pryor in his first live game action. Davis had a well-rounded game, which also featured a tipped pass on third down. Pryor demonstrated some of the big hits that earned him the nickname ‚ÄòLouisville Slugger‚Äô in college. Other Player/Game Notes: Virtually unknown linebacker A.J. Edds continues to make plays, off a notable performance in week one of the pre-season. A former 2010 fourth-round pick of the Dolphins, Edds was signed to the roster in May after a tryout. Against the Colts, Edds led the team with eight combined tackles. On Saturday night, he showed great sideline-to-sideline pace, while adding a team-leading five combined tackles. Cornerback Darrin Walls secured a silver lining for the cornerback position, with an interception that sealed the win for the Jets. As a whole, the Jets starting defense looked weaker than what most fans have grown accustomed to. In the same breath, the play calls were vanilla (with no sprinkles). The Jets play at their best when blitzing, and Rex Ryan clearly limited his men in the second preseason matchup of the year. The playbook opened up a little in the later stages of the game, and the Jets showed better for it.     Quarterback Tajh Boyd received his first in-game action, in battle with Matt Simms for the third quarterback spot on the depth chart. He put on a forgettable performance: one of five for six yards. He played exclusively with a fourth quarter squad. Oday Aboushi started the game at left guard in place of Brian Winters, while both saw action. Most, including myself, believe that Winters will start the regular season, but his rookie season play deserves this sort of competition. Neither looked significantly better than the other. Aboushi also played at tackle. WR Eric Decker did not play, as a precaution due to injury; Jalen Saunders did not play after a ‚Äòmedical incident‚Äô and/or single-car accident. Reports are contradicting. TE Jace Amaro limped off with an apparent leg injury in the third quarter, but it did not look too serious to the naked eye. Sixth-round pick DE/OLB IK Enemkpali continued where he left off against the Colts, adding a blocked punt to his film. Last week he had a strip-sack which would set up the team‚Äôs game-winning field goal. He forced another fumble on Saturday night, but it was recovered by the Bengals offense.     WR Greg Salas continues to rise. My number two camp sleeper walked into the locker room with two solid receptions for 31 yards. CBS Columnist Jeff Capellini put it best‚Ä¶Salas is better than Hill Nelson and I like Nelson. #Jets‚Äî Jeff Capellini (@GreenLanternJet) August 16, 2014     ']"
84,Carson Palmer,"['Patrick Mahomes vs Joe Burrow debate: Why Carson Palmer\'s hot take has zero substance\xa0  Every single NFL season, there is an early debate over which quarterback will challenge Patrick Mahomes as the best in the league. It\'s been Justin Herbert, Josh Allen, and right now it\'s Joe Burrow. There\'s one constant in this debate: it\'s always someone vs. Mahomes.  Since Mahomes came into the league and became a starter, he\'s been the best quarterback. He won MVP that year and has only gotten better. It\'s a hot take to say anyone is better, but that didn\'t stop Carson Palmer.        On his brother\'s podcast, he dropped one of the hottest takes in recent memory:           ""I think Joe is the best quarterback in the league. I know Patrick [Mahomes] is phenomenal, but I just think Joe‚Äôs more consistent. He‚Äôs more consistent. He‚Äôs more accountable to run the system and the play that‚Äôs called and not feel like, \'Well, he didn‚Äôt win last time and get open for me, so I‚Äôm gonna do it with my feet,\' and then before you know it, you‚Äôre sacked for a four-yard loss because you tried to make two or three guys miss.""        He finished by saying: ""Joe is just... talk about not having a weakness. Mentally strong, physically tough, accurate, can throw it far enough, fast enough, gets the ball out quick, and then he can actually do a lot with his legs."" For a lot of reasons, this take is just wrong. Palmer is a former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback, so he is probably a little partial to the current Bengals quarterback, but if he\'s portending to be an analyst, some objectivity needs to be present.  There\'s no debate between Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes With all due respect to Joe Burrow, who is an elite quarterback, there is no comparison between the two. The accolades, numbers and performances all give the edge (sometimes a major edge) to Patrick Mahomes. The only thing Burrow has over Mahomes is a 3-1 record in their matchups, but the idea that a win belongs to the quarterback alone is absurd and should be dying out.     Patrick Mahomes winning Super Bowl MVP Even beyond that, Palmer\'s take has no substance. He tried to make it a deeper argument than the numbers by saying that Joe Burrow is consistent and has no flaws. He also added that he runs the plays in the system more often. If Burrow is a flawless quarterback, then there isn\'t a word to describe Mahomes. If Burrow is consistent, then so is Patrick Mahomes and he\'s consistently great. Burrow has gotten better each season in the league, but that doesn\'t make him consistently better than Mahomes, who started out winning MVP.        Furthermore, ""he\'s more accountable to run the system and the play that\'s called"" is just a poor take. The best quarterbacks are able to adjust, audible and make plays out of rhythm and out of design. Is Palmer saying Burrow doesn\'t do that? Yes, Mahomes does audible and make plays that weren\'t called. That\'s the mark of a good quarterback. The play call isn\'t the be all end all, which is the very reason audibles exist in the first place.     In Palmer\'s mind, Joe Burrow is going to get the play call in the huddle and go to the line and run it well. Mahomes, on the other hand, might do something else. Over his five seasons as a starter, he\'s earned the right to do that and has displayed the skill and IQ to do it well.    Palmer mentions that Burrow throws it far enough and is fast enough. He doesn\'t throw it as far as Patrick Mahomes, though. He\'s also a touch slower than Mahomes, who ran the 40 0.1 seconds faster and has a proven scrambling ability.Palmer\'s hot take is just that - hot. It appears to use substance and provide alternative ways of looking at the debate, but even those don\'t really hold water. By Palmer\'s own metrics, Patrick Mahomes is still a better quarterback. That\'s nothing against Burrow, though.     ', ""Is Caleb Williams the greatest USC QB ever? Comparing the Heisman winner to Matt Leinart, Carson Palmer, and past Trojans  Caleb Williams was wildly impressive last season. Some college football analysts have called it one of the best individual performances in college football history. The question now will be what does Williams have in store for an encore?   Williams was so good he has ascended to becoming one of the top five USC QBs of all time, but with only one season under his belt, he can't top the list just yet.         Where exactly does Caleb Williams place in the top five? Let's dive in and find out:       #5) Rodney Peete (1985-88)  Rodney Peete may not have had the highs of his career that some of his contemporaries at the position have had, but Peete was as consistent as anyone. He set the record for the most starts by a QB (40), eventually eclipsed by Carson Palmer.  Rodney Peete was a winner, leading the Trojans to three straight winning seasons. Unfortunately for him, his career was never highlighted with a national title run or a Heisman Trophy award, so his name tends to get lost in the shuffle.  #4) Pat Haden (1973-74)  Many college football fans know Pat Haden as the athletic director for the Trojans, where he led many programs to great heights. What they may not know about Pat Haden, is that he was one of the greatest QBs in the history of USC.      Haden played so well in his three Rose Bowl appearances he was named to the Rose Bowl Hall-of-Fame. Haden was a highly prolific QB in an era where the offense was hard to come by.  #3) Carson Palmer (2000-02)  Carson Palmer was the epitome of a prototypical QB who seemingly did everything well. Pete Carroll arrived before Palmer's junior season, and fans saw the best version of him during his last two seasons of eligibility.  Palmer was one of the most productive QBs in the modern era, throwing for 72 TDs and almost 12,000 yards. Palmer played his best ball during his final season as he was awarded the Heisman Trophy.  #2) Caleb Williams (2022-present)  The only thing that stands in Caleb Williams' way is whether he puts together another campaign as he did in 2022. Williams was otherworldly and dominated every team put in his way last season. As a sophomore, he took home the 2022 Heisman Trophy.      Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic - Tulane v USC Several Trojan QBs have taken home the Heisman Trophy, but no one has been able to win two recognitions. With head coach Lincoln Riley dialing up the plays and plenty of weapons around him, Williams should be in the running for the Heisman Trophy once again.  #1) Matt Leinart (2003-05)  As great as Caleb Williams played last year, many have forgotten how good Matt Leinart was. Leinart was so good at USC that there's an argument that he is the greatest Trojan football player ever. Leinart only lost twice during his tenure in Southern Cal. Leinart was awarded every collegiate sports award imaginable. The USC team during the Leinart era was a collection of some of the best athletes the Trojans had ever seen.      "", ""5 NFL QBs who demanded to be traded by their team ft. Brett Favre\xa0  It's extremely rare for great NFL quarterbacks to spend their entire careers with just one team. This is especially true with the modern format of free agency. Most quarterbacks want to test the free agent market at least once during their careers to maximize the value of their contracts. This has contributed to most quarterbacks changing teams at some point in their careers.  Trades are another way that quarterbacks may experience a team swap. Their current team may trade them if they are dissatisfied with their performances or are looking to acquire capital during a rebuilding phase, among other situations.         Other times, quarterbacks may demand a trade themselves because they are unhappy with their place in their current organization.            Here are five such examples. #1 - Deshaun Watson Cleveland Browns QB Deshaun Watson Deshaun Watson demanded a trade from the Houston Texans during the 2020 offseason after becoming unhappy with the long-term contract negotiations. He ended up sitting out for the entire 2021 NFL season while also dealing with a legal situation off the field.  He was eventually traded to the Cleveland Browns before the start of the 2022 NFL season. He signed a massive contract extension worth $230 million in guaranteed money before serving an 11-game suspension.         #2 - Carson Palmer Oakland Raiders QB Carson Palmer     Carson Palmer began his career with the Cincinnati Bengals. He reportedly became unhappy with the franchise's efforts to build a competitive team around him and demanded to be traded during the 2011 NFL offseason.  The Bengals initially refused, and Palmer threatened to retire, claiming he would never play for them again. The Bengals eventually gave in and traded him to the Oakland Raiders. #3 - Baker Mayfield Carolina Panthers QB Baker Mayfield Baker Mayfield spent the first four years of his NFL career with the Cleveland Browns. His performances were inconsistent, but he sought a long-term contract to become their franchise quarterback. The Browns went a different direction, acquiring Deshaun Watson instead.      Mayfield was frustrated with the Browns' decision and demanded a trade. They granted his wish, shipping him to the Carolina Panthers. #4 - Brett Favre New York Jets QB Brett Favre Brett Favre had one of the most notorious exits in NFL history when he departed from the Green Bay Packers. He announced his retirement during the 2008 NFL offseason, and the Packers proceeded to name Aaron Rodgers their starting quarterback.  Favre changed his mind a few weeks later, but the Packers decided they would stick with Rodgers as their starter.         Favre became angry with the franchise for not giving him his job back and demanded to be traded. He attempted to force his way onto the Minnesota Vikings, but the Packers traded him to the New York Jets instead. He ended up joining the Vikings two years later during free agency. #5 - Matt Ryan Indianapolis Colts QB Matt Ryan     Matt Ryan spent his entire career with the Atlanta Falcons before the 2022 NFL season. He established himself as one of the best quarterbacks in franchise history. The Falcons reportedly made an aggressive effort to acquire Deshaun Watson during the 2022 off-season. Ryan was frustrated with their attempt to replace him and demanded a trade. They granted his wish, sending him to the Indianapolis Colts shortly after.     "", 'Every team that HBO\'s \'Hard Knocks\' has covered and how they fared that season  With the announcement that the Dallas Cowboys will be this year\'s ""Hard Knocks"" team, the hype around ""America\'s Team"" is real, but it has also prompted talk about previous participants.  Being featured on ""Hard Knocks"" more often legitimizes the direction a franchise is heading in, but is there a pattern to how these teams fare after filming the show? Here\'s a look at every team that has been featured on ""Hard Knocks"" so far and their trajectory the following season.                   NFL franchises on Hard Knocks  2001 - Baltimore Ravens After starring in ""Hard Knocks,"" the 2001 Baltimore Ravens went 10-6 and made the playoffs.

Their quarterback was Chad Hutchinson, who threw for seven touchdowns and eight interceptions. 2007 - Kansas City Chiefs ""Hard Knocks"" missed a few seasons before returning in 2007 with the Kansas City Chiefs. The 2007 Chiefs went 4-12 and missed the playoffs in some fashion. Damon Huard kitted up at QB for Kansas City, throwing for 11 touchdowns and 13 interceptions.       2008 - Dallas Cowboys The Dallas Cowboys went 9-7 and missed the playoffs in 2008. Tony Romo pulled the strings for the Cowboys, throwing for 26 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.

New York Jets      2012 - Miami Dolphins The 2012 Dolphins followed their stint on ""Hard Knocks"" with a 7-9 record. The quarterback was Ryan Tannehill, who was in his rookie year when he threw for 12 touchdowns and 13 interceptions.  2013 - Cincinnati Bengals Only a few years later, the Bengals were back on ""Hard Knocks."" They went on to win 11 games, finishing the season with a division title. They eventually lost in the Wild Card round.

Matt Ryan was the quarterback and he threw for 28 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. 2015 - Houston Texans The 2015 Houston Texans went 9-7 and won their division. They made the playoffs that year, eventually losing in the Wild Card round. Brian Hoyer was the quarterback for the Texans, throwing for 19 touchdowns and seven interceptions.      2016 - Los Angeles Rams The 2016 Los Angeles Rams went 4-12 after their time on ""Hard Knocks."" They finished third in their division and played hot potato with Case Keenum and Jared Goff. Goff went 0-7 as a starter in his rookie season.  2017 - Tampa Bay Buccaneers The 2017 Tampa Bay Buccaneers went 5-11 and missed the playoffs, finishing fourth in their division. The quarterback was Jameis Winston, who was famous for throwing a large amount of touchdowns but a nearly equal amount of interceptions. However, the following year was markedly different. He threw for 19 touchdowns and 11 interceptions that season.         2018 - Cleveland Browns The 2018 Cleveland Browns went 7-8-1, finished third in their division and missed the playoffs.

However, Justin Herbert had an explosive rookie season, throwing for 31 touchdowns and ten interceptions.2021 - Dallas CowboysWhat will the Dallas Cowboys do this season? In the past, teams have run the gamut from the bottom of the league to playoff contenders. However, none of the teams made a Super Bowl. Will the Cowboys break the trend? Or will Dak Prescott and co need some time to get back into rhythm?     ', ""5 NFL owners disliked by their teams' fans ft. Dan Snyder  The ownership of an NFL team largely influences the team's success. The ownership directly impacts the acquisition of leaders in the front office and among the coaching staff. Those selected coaches and general managers normally have the biggest influence on the recruitment of strong talent.  This illustrates how an owner's performance behind the scenes trickles down to the team's general success. Historically successful franchises can usually attribute a lot of their success to proper management. However, this means that fans normally look to their team's owner when their team isn't performing well.        All NFL owners have different approval ratings from their teams' fan bases. Owners that are loved by their fans are known for their relentless commitment to the team. They find the best managers, coaches, and players to consistently develop ways to deliver a winning football team.           When teams show disfunctional leadership for long periods of time and struggle to win, their fans usually begin to disapprove of their owner. Here are five NFL owners who are generally disliked by their teams' fans. #5 Mike Brown, Cincinnati Bengals Cincinnati Bengals owner Mike Brown     Prior to the Cincinnati Bengals winning the AFC Championship last season, Mike Brown (who acquired the team in 1991) would have been higher on this list. He will likely have gained some slack from the Bengals fan base, but probably not much. Prior to the 2022/23 NFL season, the Bengals hadn't won a single playoff game since Brown took over the team. Ben Baby@Ben_BabyBengals president Mike Brown said his only regret was not having the Lombardi Trophy. Brown: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let anybody tell you the Bengals aren‚Äôt for real.‚Äù114670 The team's fans have long been frustrated with Brown for a variety of reasons, including what they felt was a lack of desire to win.     Bengals greats like Carson Palmer and Corey Dillon left the organization, citing this as their reason. Brown also kept Marvin Lewis as the head coach for 16 years, despite never winning a playoff game. #4 Woody Johnson, New York Jets New York Jets owner Woody Johnson New York Jets fans don't necessarily dislike owner Woody Johnson for lack of effort, but rather for consistent failures. Despite spending money on players and coaches and showing a desire to be competitive, Johnson has struck out multiple times.         The Jets were victorious in Super Bowl III, but that was 50 years ago with different ownership, and they haven't appeared in another title clash since. New York fans demand winning in all sports, but Johnson hasn't provided them with substantial success on the football field. #3 Jimmy Haslam, Cleveland Browns Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam     While Jimmy Halsam has only owned the Cleveland Browns for 10 years, he has already made several moves that have aggravated the fan base. Haslam is reportedly the one who made the ultimate decision to hire Hue Jackson as head coach and draft quarterback Johnny Manziel. He was advised against both decisions but did it anyway, resulting in huge failures.     Haslam made headlines again during the 2022 NFL offseason by trading for controversial quarterback Deshaun Watson. Watson's controversy centers around 24 lawsuits involving sexual misconduct allegations. Despite the controversy, Haslam gave the QB a record-breaking contract. To make things worse, Haslam decided not to show up for the introductory press conference following the trade.     #2 The Ford Family, Detroit Lions Detroit Lions owner Sheila Ford Hamp The Ford Family has owned a share of the Detroit Lions since 1961 and the entire franchise since 1963. The Lions are one of the oldest franchises in the league and have a committed fan base, despite being unable to find consistent success. Ari Meirov@MySportsUpdate#Lions owner Sheila Ford Hamp was booed LOUDLY during Calvin Johnson‚Äôs Hall of Fame ring ceremony. 3483341     The Lions have never appeared in a Super Bowl, let alone won one. They have historically struggled to produce a winning team, and the Ford Family has shouldered the blame for nearly 60 years. #1 Dan Snyder, Washington Commanders Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder Dan Snyder is not only the most disliked owner in the NFL, but also one of the most hated owners across all sports. He's been involved in several scandals, including creating a toxic work environment, scamming season ticket holders, and financial fraud. His behavior continuously depicts him as selfish and greedy.         Snyder is currently under investigation for allegedly stealing money from the NFL's revenue sharing pool, and could potentially be forced to sell the team if found guilty. Washington fans might be hoping for such a resolution. They often used to bring signs to home games criticizing their owner, but Snyder banned the use of signs in an attempt to silence them.
