quite enviable position year draft class doesnt cantmiss future star like andrew luck robert griffin iii kansa city chief unenviable position first time history chief hold 1 overall pick good year nobody seems know take isnt cam newton andrew luck draft well still look quarterback position first foremost twelve last fifteen 1 overall pick quarterback important position field every team know

2011 first round draft choice jon baldwin tight end tony moeaki star man dwayne bowe back back 1000 yard receiving season mess 2012 potentially productive group talent offense seems everywhere except quarterback dont think youll find anybody think head coach andy reid general manager john dorsey going stick incumbent incapable duo matt cassel brady quinn need find quarterback problem deciding new quarterback going number veteran option available guy like alex smith nick foles matt flynn sitting trading block drew stanton matt moore available free agent quite frankly im excited guy foles wa reid philadelphia kansa city potential fit im buying though foles isnt best choice group deal starting look le le likely alex smith actually best talent available dont know worth pursuing trade either especially considering value going inflated quarterbacksparse season period chief cant afford giving draft pick right ha speculation chief 49ers close deal send smith arrowhead really many source saying many different thing rumourfactory otherwise known nfl combine difficult know believe im choosing believe leaf rookie oh boy rookie everybody ha heard past two month poor year quarterback draft

quarterback 1 overall going geno smith geno smith consensus 1 quarterback 1 overall pick number thing chief consider want pick smith draft first happy situation left tackle current starter brandon albert hitting free agency ha reported chief trying resign dont hold onto albert big gap fill offensive line happens think chief look taking luke joeckel probably talented player draft 1 overall pick albert doe sign taking joeckel doesnt make much sense secondly andy reid ha comfortable got work defensive side ball commit taking quarterback glenn dorsey almost certainly leaving free agency former first round pick tyson jackson might also door star lotuleilei would add much needed talent kansa city defensive front event jackson ha underwhelming first four season recording 5 sack 59 nfl game

mind power kansa going tempted select utah star lotuleilei florida shariff floyd make happen one point interest note andy reid tenure philadelphia eagle 12 first round pick took 6 defensive linemen reid really like strengthening trench comfortable defensive line big final question ask geno smith good enough taken 1 overall pick gut reaction question mainly majority opinion smith probably first round talent contrary mike mayocks belief drafting 1 overall seems like reach year might anywhere near top draft board unfortunately quarterback driven league reach chief might make cant settle matt cassell performance season option free agency limited best else well another option would trade perhaps take smith lower pick better suit value wa reported andy reid ha put sale sign 1 overall pick willing listen offer lot fan chief message board believe far best strategy chief employ well good saying best idea would trade collect draft pick work someone willing pay price move dont think fish bite one classic contradiction chief wouldnt trying trade wa player worth trading think chief probably stuck mean dorsey reid going serious thinking april going figure riddle thing considered drafting smith might worst decision make isnt cam newton andrew luck doesnt really need chief 5th best rushing attack football past year jamaal charles leading way probably going lean run game matter quarterback smith wont asked come throw 600 time like andrew luck wa last season ha game manager get ball receiver enough defence cant bring 8 guy line scrimmage definitely talented enough alex smith also good enough though tested trade rumour true geno smith kiss goodbye going 1 overall right chief looking four player geno smith luke joeckel star lutoleilei shariff floyd trade alex smith doesnt
